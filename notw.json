The Waystone Inn lay in silence, and it was a silence of three parts.", "The most obvious part was a hollow, echoing quiet, made by things that were lacking. If there had been a wind it would have sighed through the trees, set the inn\u2019s sign creaking on its hooks, and brushed the silence down the road like trailing autumn leaves. If there had been a crowd, even a handful of men inside the inn, they would have filled the silence with conversation and laughter, the clatter and clamor one expects from a drinking house during the dark hours of night. If there had been music ... but no, of course there was no music. In fact there were none of these things, and so the silence remained.", "Inside the Waystone a pair of men huddled at one corner of the bar. They drank with quiet determination, avoiding serious discussions of troubling news. In doing this they added a small, sullen silence to the larger, hollow one. It made an alloy of sorts, a counterpoint.", "The third silence was not an easy thing to notice. If you listened for an hour, you might begin to feel it in the wooden floor underfoot and in the rough, splintering barrels behind the bar. It was in the weight of the black stone hearth that held the heat of a long dead fire. It was in the slow back and forth of a white linen cloth rubbing along the grain of the bar. And it was in the hands of the man who stood there, polishing a stretch of mahogany that already gleamed in the lamplight.", "The man had true-red hair, red as flame. His eyes were dark and distant, and he moved with the subtle certainty that comes from knowing many things.", "The Waystone was his, just as the third silence was his. This was appropriate, as it was the greatest silence of the three, wrapping the others inside itself. It was deep and wide as autumn\u2019s ending. It was heavy as a great river-smooth stone. It was the patient, cut-flower sound of a man who is waiting to die.", "", "", ""], "CHAPTER ONE": ["CHAPTER ONE", "A Place for Demons", "\nIt was felling night; and the usual crowd had gathered at the Way-stone Inn. Five wasn\u2019t much of a crowd, but five was as many as the Way-stone ever saw these days, times being what they were.", "Old Cob was filling his role as storyteller and advice dispensary. The men at the bar sipped their drinks and listened. In the back room a young innkeeper stood out of sight behind the door, smiling as he listened to the details of a familiar story.", "\u201cWhen he awoke, Taborlin the Great found himself locked in a high tower. They had taken his sword and stripped him of his tools: key, coin, and candle were all gone. But that weren\u2019t even the worst of it, you see ...\u201d Cob paused for effect, \u201c... cause the lamps on the wall were burning blue!\u201d", "Graham, Jake, and Shep nodded to themselves. The three friends had grown up together, listening to Cob\u2019s stories and ignoring his advice.", "Cob peered closely at the newer, more attentive member of his small audience, the smith\u2019s prentice. \u201cDo you know what that meant, boy?\u201d Everyone called the smith\u2019s prentice \u201cboy\u201d despite the fact that he was a hand taller than anyone there. Small towns being what they are, he would most likely remain \u201cboy\u201d until his beard filled out or he bloodied someone\u2019s nose over the matter.", "The boy gave a slow nod. \u201cThe Chandrian.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Cob said approvingly. \u201cThe Chandrian. Everyone knows that blue fire is one of their signs. Now he was\u2014\u201d", "\u201cBut how\u2019d they find him?\u201d the boy interrupted. \u201cAnd why din\u2019t they kill him when they had the chance?\u201d", "\u201cHush now, you\u2019ll get all the answers before the end,\u201d Jake said. \u201cJust let him tell it.\u201d", "\u201cNo need for all that, Jake,\u201d Graham said. \u201cBoy\u2019s just curious. Drink your drink.\u201d", "\u201cI drank me drink already,\u201d Jake grumbled. \u201cI need t\u2019nother but the innkeep\u2019s still skinning rats in the back room.\u201d He raised his voice and knocked his empty mug hollowly on the top of the mahogany bar. \u201cHoy! We\u2019re thirsty men in here!\u201d", "The innkeeper appeared with five bowls of stew and two warm, round loaves of bread. He pulled more beer for Jake, Shep, and Old Cob, moving with an air of bustling efficiency", "The story was set aside while the men tended to their dinners. Old Cob tucked away his bowl of stew with the predatory efficiency of a lifetime bachelor. The others were still blowing steam off their bowls when he finished the last of his loaf and returned to his story.", "\u201cNow Taborlin needed to escape, but when he looked around, he saw his cell had no door. No windows. All around him was nothing but smooth, hard stone. It was a cell no man had ever escaped.", "\u201cBut Taborlin knew the names of all things, and so all things were his to command. He said to the stone: \u2018Break!\u2019 and the stone broke. The wall tore like a piece of paper, and through that hole Taborlin could see the sky and breathe the sweet spring air. He stepped to the edge, looked down, and without a second thought he stepped out into the open air....\u201d", "The boy\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cHe didn\u2019t!\u201d", "Cob nodded seriously. \u201cSo Taborlin fell, but he did not despair. For he knew the name of the wind, and so the wind obeyed him. He spoke to the wind and it cradled and caressed him. It bore him to the ground as gently as a puff of thistledown and set him on his feet softly as a mother\u2019s kiss.", "\u201cAnd when he got to the ground and felt his side where they\u2019d stabbed him, he saw that it weren\u2019t hardly a scratch. Now maybe it was just a piece of luck,\u201d Cob tapped the side of his nose knowingly. \u201cOr maybe it had something to do with the amulet he was wearing under his shirt.\u201d", "\u201cWhat amulet?\u201d the boy asked eagerly through a mouthful of stew.", "Old Cob leaned back on his stool, glad for the chance to elaborate. \u201cA few days earlier, Taborlin had met a tinker on the road. And even though Taborlin didn\u2019t have much to eat, he shared his dinner with the old man.\u201d", "\u201cRight sensible thing to do,\u201d Graham said quietly to the boy. \u201cEveryone knows: \u2018A tinker pays for kindness twice.\u2019 \u201d", "\u201cNo no,\u201d Jake grumbled. \u201cGet it right: \u2018A tinker\u2019s advice pays kindness twice.\u2019 \u201d", "The innkeeper spoke up for the first time that night. \u201cActually, you\u2019re missing more than half,\u201d he said, standing in the doorway behind the bar.", "\u201cA tinker\u2019s debt is always paid:", "Once for any simple trade.", "Twice for freely-given aid.", "Thrice for any insult made.\u201d", "", "", "The men at the bar seemed almost surprised to see Kote standing there. They\u2019d been coming to the Waystone every Felling night for months and Kote had never interjected anything of his own before. Not that you could expect anything else, really. He\u2019d only been in town for a year or so. He was still a stranger. The smith\u2019s prentice had lived here since he was eleven, and he was still referred to as \u201cthat Rannish boy,\u201d as if Rannish were some foreign country and not a town less than thirty miles away", "\u201cJust something I heard once,\u201d Kote said to fill the silence, obviously embarrassed.", "Old Cob nodded before he cleared his throat and launched back into the story. \u201cNow this amulet was worth a whole bucket of gold nobles, but on account of Taborlin\u2019s kindness, the tinker sold it to him for nothing but an iron penny, a copper penny, and a silver penny. It was black as a winter night and cold as ice to touch, but so long as it was round his neck, Taborlin would be safe from the harm of evil things. Demons and such.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019d give a good piece for such a thing these days,\u201d Shep said darkly. He had drunk most and talked least over the course of the evening. Everyone knew that something bad had happened out on his farm last Cendling night, but since they were good friends they knew better than to press him for the details. At least not this early in the evening, not as sober as they were.", "\u201cAye, who wouldn\u2019t?\u201d Old Cob said judiciously, taking a long drink.", "\u201cI din\u2019t know the Chandrian were demons,\u201d the boy said. \u201cI\u2019d heard\u2014\u201d", "\u201cThey ain\u2019t demons,\u201d Jake said firmly. \u201cThey were the first six people to refuse Tehlu\u2019s choice of the path, and he cursed them to wander the corners\u2014\u201d", "\u201cAre you telling this story, Jacob Walker?\u201d Cob said sharply. \u201cCause if you are, I\u2019ll just let you get on with it.\u201d", "The two men glared at each other for a long moment. Eventually Jake looked away, muttering something that could, conceivably, have been an apology.", "Cob turned back to the boy. \u201cThat\u2019s the mystery of the Chandrian,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhere do they come from? Where do they go after they\u2019ve done their bloody deeds? Are they men who sold their souls? Demons? Spirits? No one knows.\u201d Cob shot Jake a profoundly disdainful look. \u201cThough every half-wit claims he knows...\u201d", "The story fell further into bickering at this point, about the nature of the Chandrian, the signs that showed their presence to the wary, and whether the amulet would protect Taborlin from bandits, or mad dogs, or falling off a horse. Things were getting heated when the front door banged open.", "Jake looked over. \u201cIt\u2019s about time you got in, Carter. Tell this damn fool the difference between a demon and a dog. Everybody kn\u2014\u201d Jake stopped midsentence and rushed to the door. \u201cGod\u2019s body, what happened to you?\u201d", "Carter stepped into the light, his face pale and smeared with blood. He clutched an old saddle blanket to his chest. It was an odd, awkward shape, as if it were wrapped around a tangle of kindling sticks.", "His friends jumped off their stools and hurried over at the sight of him. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said as he made his slow way into the common room. His eyes were wild around the edges, like a skittish horse. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m fine.\u201d", "He dropped the bundled blanket onto the nearest table where it knocked hard against the wood, as if it were full of stones. His clothes were crisscrossed with long, straight cuts. His grey shirt hung in loose tatters except where it was stuck to his body, stained a dark, sullen red.", "Graham tried to ease him into a chair. \u201cMother of God. Sit down, Carter. What happened to you? Sit down.\u201d", "Carter shook his head stubbornly. \u201cI told you, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m not hurt that bad.\u201d", "\u201cHow many were there?\u201d Graham said.", "\u201cOne,\u201d Carter said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not what you think\u2014\u201d", "\u201cGoddammit. I told you, Carter,\u201d Old Cob burst out with the sort of frightened anger only relatives and close friends can muster. \u201cI told you for months now. You can\u2019t go out alone. Not even as far as Baedn. It ain\u2019t safe.\u201d Jake laid a hand on the old man\u2019s arm, quieting him.", "\u201cJust take a sit,\u201d Graham said, still trying to steer Carter into a chair. \u201cLet\u2019s get that shirt off you and get you cleaned up.\u201d", "Carter shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I got cut up a little, but the blood is mostly Nelly\u2019s. It jumped on her. Killed her about two miles outside town, past the Oldstone Bridge.\u201d", "A moment of serious silence followed the news. The smith\u2019s prentice laid a sympathetic hand on Carter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDamn. That\u2019s hard. She was gentle as a lamb, too. Never tried to bite or kick when you brought her in for shoes. Best horse in town. Damn. I\u2019m ...\u201d He trailed off. \u201cDamn. I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d He looked around helplessly.", "Cob finally managed to free himself from Jake. \u201cI told you,\u201d he repeated, shaking a finger in Carter\u2019s direction. \u201cThere\u2019s folks out lately that would kill you for a pair of pennies, let alone a horse and cart. What are you going to do now? Pull it yourself?\u201d", "There was a moment of uncomfortable quiet. Jake and Cob glared at each other while the rest seemed at a loss for words, unsure of how to comfort their friend.", "The innkeeper moved carefully through the silence. Arms full, he stepped nimbly around Shep and began to arrange some items on a nearby table: a bowl of hot water, shears, some clean linen, a few glass bottles, needle and gut.", "\u201cThis never would have happened if he\u2019d listened to me in the first place,\u201d Old Cob muttered. Jake tried to quiet him, but Cob brushed him aside. \u201cI\u2019m just tellin\u2019 the truth. It\u2019s a damn shame about Nelly, but he better listen now or he\u2019ll end up dead. You don\u2019t get lucky twice with those sort of men.\u201d", "Carter\u2019s mouth made a thin line. He reached out and pulled the edge of the bloody blanket. Whatever was inside flipped over once and snagged on the cloth. Carter tugged harder and there was a clatter like a bag of flat river stones upended onto the tabletop.", "It was a spider as large as a wagon wheel, black as slate.", "The smith\u2019s prentice jumped backward and hit a table, knocking it over and almost falling to the ground himself. Cob\u2019s face went slack. Graham, Shep, and Jake made wordless, startled sounds and moved away, raising their hands to their faces. Carter took a step backward that was almost like a nervous twitch. Silence filled the room like a cold sweat.", "The innkeeper frowned. \u201cThey can\u2019t have made it this far west yet,\u201d he said softly.", "If not for the silence, it is unlikely anyone would have heard him. But they did. Their eyes pulled away from the thing on the table to stare mutely at the red-haired man.", "Jake found his voice first. \u201cYou know what this is?\u201d", "The innkeeper\u2019s eyes were distant. \u201cScrael,\u201d he said distractedly. \u201cI\u2019d thought the mountains\u2014\u201d", "\u201cScrael?\u201d Jake broke in. \u201cBlackened body of God, Kote. You\u2019ve seen these things before?\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d The red-haired innkeeper looked up sharply, as if suddenly remembering where he was. \u201cOh. No. No, of course not.\u201d Seeing that he was the only one within arm\u2019s length of the dark thing, he took a measured step away. \u201cJust something I heard.\u201d They stared at him. \u201cDo you remember the trader that came through about two span ago?\u201d", "They all nodded. \u201cBastard tried to charge me ten pennies for a half-pound of salt,\u201d Cob said reflexively repeating the complaint for perhaps the hundredth time.", "\u201cWish I\u2019d bought some,\u201d Jake mumbled. Graham nodded a silent agreement.", "\u201cHe was a filthy shim,\u201d Cob spat, seeming to find comfort in the familiar words. \u201cI might pay two in a tight time, but ten is robbery.\u201d", "\u201cNot if there are more of those on the road,\u201d Shep said darkly.", "All eyes went back to the thing on the table.", "\u201cHe told me he\u2019d heard of them over near Melcombe,\u201d Kote said quickly, watching everyone\u2019s faces as they studied the thing on the table. \u201cI thought he was just trying to drive up his prices.\u201d", "\u201cWhat else did he say?\u201d Carter asked.", "The innkeeper looked thoughtful for a moment, then shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t get the whole story. He was only in town for a couple hours.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t like spiders,\u201d the smith\u2019s prentice said. He remained on the other side of a table some fifteen feet away. \u201cCover it up.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not a spider,\u201d Jake said. \u201cIt\u2019s got no eyes.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s got no mouth either,\u201d Carter pointed out. \u201cHow does it eat?\u201d", "\u201c What does it eat?\u201d Shep said darkly.", "The innkeeper continued to eye the thing curiously. He leaned closer, stretching out a hand. Everyone edged even farther away from the table.", "\u201cCareful,\u201d Carter said. \u201cIts feet are sharp like knives.\u201d", "\u201cMore like razors,\u201d Kote said. His long fingers brushed the scrael\u2019s black, featureless body. \u201cIt\u2019s smooth and hard, like pottery.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t go messing with it,\u201d the smith\u2019s prentice said.", "Moving carefully, the innkeeper took one of the long, smooth legs and tried to break it with both hands like a stick. \u201cNot pottery,\u201d he amended. He set it against the edge of the table and leaned his weight against it. It broke with a sharp crack. \u201cMore like stone.\u201d He looked up at Carter. \u201cHow did it get all these cracks?\u201d He pointed at the thin fractures that crazed the smooth black surface of the body.", "\u201cNelly fell on it,\u201d Carter said. \u201cIt jumped out of a tree and started to climb all over her, cutting her up with its feet. It moved so fast. I didn\u2019t even know what was going on.\u201d Carter finally sank into the chair at Graham\u2019s urging. \u201cShe got tangled in her harness and fell on it, broke some of its legs. Then it came after me, got on me, crawling all over.\u201d He crossed his arms in front of his bloody chest and shuddered. \u201cI managed to get it off me and stomped it hard as I could. Then it got on me again....\u201d He trailed off, his face ashen.", "The innkeeper nodded to himself as he continued to prod the thing. \u201cThere\u2019s no blood. No organs. It\u2019s just grey inside.\u201d He poked it with a finger. \u201cLike a mushroom.\u201d", "\u201cGreat Tehlu, just leave it alone,\u201d the smith\u2019s prentice begged. \u201cSometimes spiders twitch after you kill them.\u201d", "\u201cListen to yourselves,\u201d Cob said scathingly. \u201cSpiders don\u2019t get big as pigs. You know what this is.\u201d He looked around, making eye contact with each of them. \u201cIt\u2019s a demon.\u201d", "They looked at the broken thing. \u201cOh, come on now,\u201d Jake said, disagreeing mostly out of habit. \u201cIt\u2019s not like ...\u201d He made an inarticulate gesture. \u201cIt can\u2019t just ...\u201d", "Everyone knew what he was thinking. Certainly there were demons in the world. But they were like Tehlu\u2019s angels. They were like heroes and kings. They belonged in stories. They belonged out there. Taborlin the Great called up fire and lightning to destroy demons. Tehlu broke them in his hands and sent them howling into the nameless void. Your childhood friend didn\u2019t stomp one to death on the road to Baedn-Bryt. It was ridiculous.", "Kote ran his hand through his red hair, then broke the silence. \u201cThere\u2019s one way to tell for sure,\u201d he said, reaching into his pocket. \u201cIron or fire.\u201d He brought out a bulging leather purse.", "\u201cAnd the name of God,\u201d Graham pointed out. \u201cDemons fear three things: cold iron, clean fire, and the holy name of God.\u201d", "The innkeeper\u2019s mouth pressed itself into a straight line that was not quite a frown. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said as he emptied his purse onto the table then fingered through the jumbled coins: heavy silver talents and thin silver bits, copper jots, broken ha\u2019pennies, and iron drabs. \u201cDoes anyone have a shim?\u201d", "\u201cJust use a drab,\u201d Jake said. \u201cThat\u2019s good iron.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t want good iron,\u201d the innkeeper said. \u201cA drab has too much carbon in it. It\u2019s almost steel.\u201d", "\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d the smith\u2019s prentice said. \u201cExcept it\u2019s not carbon. You use coke to make steel. Coke and lime.\u201d", "The innkeeper nodded deferentially to the boy. \u201cYou\u2019d know best, young master. It\u2019s your business after all.\u201d His long fingers finally found a shim in the pile of coins. He held it up. \u201cHere we are.\u201d", "\u201cWhat will it do?\u201d Jake asked.", "\u201cIron kills demons,\u201d Cob\u2019s voice was uncertain, \u201cbut this one\u2019s already dead. It might not do anything.\u201d", "\u201cOne way to find out.\u201d The innkeeper met each of their eyes briefly, as if measuring them. Then he turned purposefully back to the table, and they edged farther away", "Kote pressed the iron shim to the black side of the creature, and there was a short, sharp crackling sound, like a pine log snapping in a hot fire. Everyone startled, then relaxed when the black thing remained motionless. Cob and the others exchanged shaky smiles, like boys spooked by a ghost story. Their smiles went sour as the room filled with the sweet, acrid smell of rotting flowers and burning hair.", "The innkeeper pressed the shim onto the table with a sharp click. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, brushing his hands against his apron. \u201cI guess that settles that. What do we do now?\u201d", "", "Hours later, the innkeeper stood in the doorway of the Waystone and let his eyes relax to the darkness. Footprints of lamplight from the inn\u2019s windows fell across the dirt road and the doors of the smithy across the way. It was not a large road, or well traveled. It didn\u2019t seem to lead anywhere, as some roads do. The innkeeper drew a deep breath of autumn air and looked around restlessly, as if waiting for something to happen.", "He called himself Kote. He had chosen the name carefully when he came to this place. He had taken a new name for most of the usual reasons, and for a few unusual ones as well, not the least of which was the fact that names were important to him.", "Looking up, he saw a thousand stars glittering in the deep velvet of a night with no moon. He knew them all, their stories and their names. He knew them in a familiar way, the way he knew his own hands.", "Looking down, Kote sighed without knowing it and went back inside. He locked the door and shuttered the wide windows of the inn, as if to distance himself from the stars and all their varied names.", "He swept the floor methodically, catching all the corners. He washed the tables and the bar, moving with a patient efficiency At the end of an hour\u2019s work, the water in his bucket was still clean enough for a lady to wash her hands in.", "Finally, he pulled a stool behind the bar and began to polish the vast array of bottles nestled between the two huge barrels. He wasn\u2019t nearly as crisp and efficient about this chore as he had been with the others, and it soon became obvious the polishing was only an excuse to touch and hold. He even hummed a little, although he did not realize it, and would have stopped himself if he had known.", "As he turned the bottles in his long, graceful hands the familiar motion eased a few tired lines from his face, making him seem younger, certainly not yet thirty. Not even near thirty. Young for an innkeeper. Young for a man with so many tired lines remaining on his face.", "", "Kote came to the top of the stairs and opened the door. His room was austere, almost monkish. There was a black stone fireplace in the center of the room, a pair of chairs, and a small desk. The only other furniture was a narrow bed with a large, dark chest at its foot. Nothing decorated the walls or covered the wooden floor.", "There were footsteps in the hall, and a young man stepped into the room carrying a bowl of stew that steamed and smelled of pepper. He was dark and charming, with a quick smile and cunning eyes. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been this late in weeks,\u201d he said as he handed over the bowl. \u201cThere must have been good stories tonight, Reshi.\u201d", "Reshi was another of the innkeeper\u2019s names, a nickname almost. The sound of it tugged one corner of his mouth into a wry smile as he sank into the deep chair in front of the fire. \u201cSo, what did you learn today, Bast?\u201d", "\u201cToday, master, I learned why great lovers have better eyesight than great scholars.\u201d", "\u201cAnd why is that, Bast?\u201d Kote asked, amusement touching the edges of his voice.", "Bast closed the door and returned to sit in the second chair, turning it to face his teacher and the fire. He moved with a strange delicacy and grace, as if he were close to dancing. \u201cWell Reshi, all the rich books are found inside where the light is bad. But lovely girls tend to be out in the sunshine and therefore much easier to study without risk of injuring one\u2019s eyes.\u201d", "Kote nodded. \u201cBut an exceptionally clever student could take a book outside, thus bettering himself without fear of lessening his much-loved faculty of sight.\u201d", "\u201cI thought the same thing, Reshi. Being, of course, an exceptionally clever student.\u201d", "\u201cOf course.\u201d", "\u201cBut when I found a place in the sun where I could read, a beautiful girl came along and kept me from doing anything of the sort,\u201d Bast finished with a flourish.", "Kote sighed. \u201cAm I correct in assuming you didn\u2019t manage to read any of Celum Tinture today?\u201d", "Bast managed to look somewhat ashamed.", "Looking into the fire, Kote tried to assume a stern face and failed. \u201cAh Bast, I hope she was lovely as a warm wind in the shade. I\u2019m a bad teacher to say it, but I\u2019m glad. I don\u2019t feel up to a long bout of lessons right now.\u201d There was a moment of silence. \u201cCarter was attacked by a scraeling tonight.\u201d", "Bast\u2019s easy smile fell away like a cracked mask, leaving his face stricken and pale. \u201cThe scrael?\u201d He came halfway to his feet as if he would bolt from the room, then gave an embarrassed frown and forced himself back down into his chair. \u201cHow do you know? Who found his body?\u201d", "\u201cHe\u2019s still alive, Bast. He brought it back. There was only one.\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as one scraeling,\u201d Bast said flatly. \u201cYou know that.\u201d", "\u201cI know,\u201d Kote said. \u201cThe fact remains there was only one.\u201d", "\u201cAnd he killed it?\u201d Bast said. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been a scraeling. Maybe\u2014\u201d", "\u201cBast, it was one of the scrael. I saw it.\u201d Kote gave him a serious look. \u201cHe was lucky, that\u2019s all. Even so he was badly hurt. Forty-eight stitches. I used up nearly all my gut.\u201d Kote picked up his bowl of stew. \u201cIf anyone asks, tell them my grandfather was a caravan guard who taught me how to clean and stitch a wound. They were too shocked to ask about it tonight, but tomorrow some of them might get curious. I don\u2019t want that.\u201d He blew into his bowl, raising a cloud of steam around his face.", "\u201cWhat did you do with the body?\u201d", "\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything with it,\u201d Kote said pointedly \u201cI am just an innkeeper. This sort of thing is quite beyond me.\u201d", "\u201cReshi, you can\u2019t just let them muddle through this on their own.\u201d", "Kote sighed. \u201cThey took it to the priest. He did all the right things for all the wrong reasons.\u201d", "Bast opened his mouth, but Kote continued before he could say anything. \u201cYes, I made sure the pit was deep enough. Yes, I made sure there was rowan wood in the fire. Yes, I made sure it burned long and hot before they buried it. And yes, I made sure that no one kept a piece of it as a souvenir.\u201d He scowled, his eyebrows drawing together. \u201cI\u2019m not an idiot, you know.\u201d", "Bast visibly relaxed, settling back into his chair. \u201cI know you\u2019re not, Reshi. But I wouldn\u2019t trust half these people to piss leeward without help.\u201d He looked thoughtful for a moment. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine why there was only one.\u201d", "\u201cMaybe they died coming over the mountains,\u201d Kote suggested. \u201cAll but this one.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d Bast admitted reluctantly.", "\u201cMaybe it was that storm from a couple days back,\u201d Kote pointed out. \u201cA real wagon-tipper, as we used to say back in the troupe. All the wind and rain might have scattered one loose from the pack.\u201d", "\u201cI like your first idea better, Reshi,\u201d Bast said uncomfortably. \u201cThree or four scrael would go through this town like ... like ...\u201d", "\u201cLike a hot knife through butter?\u201d", "\u201cMore like several hot knives through several dozen farmers,\u201d Bast said dryly. \u201cThese people can\u2019t defend themselves. I bet there aren\u2019t six swords in this whole town. Not that swords would do much good against the scrael.\u201d", "There was a long moment of thoughtful silence. After a moment Bast began to fidget. \u201cAny news?\u201d", "Kote shook his head. \u201cThey didn\u2019t get to the news tonight. Carter disrupted things while they were still telling stories. That\u2019s something, I suppose. They\u2019ll be back tomorrow night. It\u2019ll give me something to do.\u201d", "Kote poked his spoon idly into the stew. \u201cI should have bought the scrael from Carter,\u201d he mused. \u201cHe could\u2019ve used the money for a new horse. People would have come from all over to see it. We could have had some business for a change.\u201d", "Bast gave him a speechless, horrified look.", "Kote made a pacifying gesture with the hand that held the spoon. \u201cI\u2019m joking, Bast.\u201d He gave a weak smile. \u201cStill, it would have been nice.\u201d", "\u201cNo Reshi, it most certainly would not have been nice,\u201d Bast said emphatically \u201c \u2018People would have come from all over to see it,\u2019 \u201d he repeated derisively. \u201cIndeed.\u201d", "\u201cThe business would have been nice,\u201d Kote clarified. \u201cBusy-ness would be nice.\u201d He jabbed his spoon into the stew again. \u201cAnything would be nice.\u201d", "They sat for a long moment. Kote scowling down into the bowl of stew in his hands, his eyes far away \u201cIt must be awful for you here, Bast,\u201d he said at last. \u201cYou must be numb with boredom.\u201d", "Bast shrugged. \u201cThere are a few young wives in town. A scattering of daughters.\u201d He grinned like a child. \u201cI tend to make my own fun.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s good, Bast.\u201d There was another silence. Kote took another spoonful, chewed, swallowed. \u201cThey thought it was a demon, you know.\u201d", "Bast shrugged. \u201cIt might as well be, Reshi. It\u2019s probably the best thing for them to think.\u201d", "\u201cI know. I encouraged them, in fact. But you know what that means.\u201d He met Bast\u2019s eyes. \u201cThe blacksmith is going to be doing a brisk business in the next couple days.\u201d", "Bast\u2019s expression went carefully blank. \u201cOh.\u201d", "Kote nodded. \u201cI won\u2019t blame you if you want to leave, Bast. You have better places to be than this.\u201d", "Bast\u2019s expression was shocked. \u201cI couldn\u2019t leave, Reshi.\u201d He opened and closed his mouth a few times, at a loss for words. \u201cWho else would teach me?\u201d", "Kote grinned, and for a moment his face showed how truly young he was. Behind the weary lines and the placid innkeeper\u2019s expression he looked no older than his dark-haired companion. \u201cWho indeed?\u201d He gestured toward the door with his spoon. \u201cGo do your reading then, or bother someone\u2019s daughter. I\u2019m sure you have better things to do than watch me eat.\u201d", "\u201cActually ...\u201d", "\u201cBegone demon!\u201d Kote said, switching to a thickly accented Temic through half a mouthful of stew. \u201cTehus antausa eha!\u201d", "Bast burst into startled laughter and made an obscene gesture with one hand.", "Kote swallowed and changed languages. \u201cAroi te denna-leyan!\u201d", "\u201cOh come now,\u201d Bast reproached, his smile falling away. \u201cThat\u2019s just insulting.\u201d", "\u201cBy earth and stone, I abjure you!\u201d Kote dipped his fingers into the cup by his side and flicked droplets casually in Bast\u2019s direction. \u201cGlamour be banished!\u201d", "\u201cWith cider?\u201d Bast managed to look amused and annoyed at the same time as he daubed a bead of liquid from the front of his shirt. \u201cThis better not stain.\u201d", "Kote took another bite of his dinner. \u201cGo soak it. If the situation becomes desperate, I recommend you avail yourself of the numerous solvent formulae extant in Celum Tinture. Chapter thirteen, I believe.\u201d", "\u201cFine.\u201d Bast stood and walked to the door, stepping with his strange, casual grace. \u201cCall if you need anything.\u201d He closed the door behind himself.", "Kote ate slowly, mopping up the last of the stew with a piece of bread. He looked out the window as he ate, or tried to, as the lamplight turned its surface mirrorlike against the dark behind it.", "His eyes wandered the room restlessly. The fireplace was made of the same black rock as the one downstairs. It stood in the center of the room, a minor feat of engineering of which Kote was rather proud. The bed was small, little more than a cot, and if you were to touch it you would find the mattress almost nonexistent.", "A skilled observer might notice there was something his gaze avoided. The same way you avoid meeting the eye of an old lover at a formal dinner, or that of an old enemy sitting across the room in a crowded alehouse late at night.", "Kote tried to relax, failed, fidgeted, sighed, shifted in his seat, and without willing it his eyes fell on the chest at the foot of the bed.", "It was made of roah, a rare, heavy wood, dark as coal and smooth as polished glass. Prized by perfumers and alchemists, a piece the size of your thumb was easily worth gold. To have a chest made of it went far beyond extravagance.", "The chest was sealed three times. It had a lock of iron, a lock of copper, and a lock that could not be seen. Tonight the wood filled the room with the almost imperceptible aroma of citrus and quenching iron.", "When Kote\u2019s eyes fell on the chest they did not dart quickly away. They did not slide slyly to the side as if he would pretend it wasn\u2019t there at all. But in a moment of looking, his face regained all the lines the simple pleasures of the day had slowly smoothed away. The comfort of his bottles and books was erased in a second, leaving nothing behind his eyes but emptiness and ache. For a moment fierce longing and regret warred across his face.", "Then they were gone, replaced by the weary face of an innkeeper, a man who called himself Kote. He sighed again without knowing it and pushed himself to his feet.", "It was a long time before he walked past the chest to bed. Once in bed, it was a long time before he slept.", "", "As Kote had guessed, they came back to the Waystone the next night for dinner and drinks. There were a few half-hearted attempts at stories, but they died out quickly. No one was really in the mood.", "So it was still early in the evening when the discussion turned to matters of greater import. They chewed over the rumors that had come into town, most of them troubling. The Penitent King was having a difficult time with the rebels in Resavek. This caused some concern, but only in a general way. Resavek was a long way off, and even Cob, the most worldly of them, would be hard pressed to find it on a map.", "They discussed the war in their own terms. Cob predicted a third levy tax after the harvests were in. No one argued, though there hadn\u2019t been a three-bleeder year in living memory.", "Jake guessed the harvest would be good enough so the third levy wouldn\u2019t break most families. Except the Bentleys, who were on hard times anyway. And the Orissons, whose sheep kept disappearing. And Crazy Martin, who had planted all barley this year. Every farmer with half a brain had planted beans. That was one good thing about all the fighting\u2014soldiers ate beans, and prices would be high.", "After a few more drinks, deeper concerns were voiced. Deserter soldiers and other opportunists were thick on the roads, making even short trips risky. The roads were always bad, of course, in the same way that winter was always cold. You complained, took sensible precautions, and got on with the business of living your life.", "But this was different. Over the last two months the roads had become so bad that people had stopped complaining. The last caravan had two wagons and four guards. The merchant had been asking ten pennies for half a pound of salt, fifteen for a loaf of sugar. He didn\u2019t have any pepper, or cinnamon, or chocolate. He did have one small sack of coffee, but he wanted two silver talents for that. At first people had laughed at his prices. Then, when he held firm, folk had spat and cursed at him.", "That had been two span ago: twenty-two days. There had not been another serious trader since, even though this was the season for it. So despite the third levy tax looming large in everyone\u2019s minds, people were looking in their purses and wishing they\u2019d bought a little something, just in case the snow came early.", "No one spoke of the previous night, of the thing they had burned and buried. Other folk were talking, of course. The town was alive with gossip. Carter\u2019s wounds ensured that the stories were taken half seriously, but not much more than half. The word \u201cdemon\u201d was being spoken, but it was with smiles half-hidden behind raised hands.", "Only the six friends had seen the thing before it was burned. One of them had been wounded and the others had been drinking. The priest had seen it too, but it was his job to see demons. Demons were good for his business.", "The innkeeper had seen it too, apparently But he wasn\u2019t from around here. He couldn\u2019t know the truth that was so apparent to everyone born and raised in this little town: stories were told here, but they happened somewhere else. This was not a place for demons.", "Besides, things were bad enough without borrowing trouble. Cob and the rest knew there was no sense talking about it. Trying to convince folk would only make them a laughingstock, like Crazy Martin, who had been trying to dig a well inside his own house for years now.", "Still, each of them bought a piece of cold-wrought iron from the smith, heavy as they could swing, and none of them said what they were thinking. Instead they complained that the roads were bad and getting worse. They talked about merchants, and deserters, and levies, and not enough salt to last the winter. They reminisced that three years ago no one would have even thought of locking their doors at night, let alone barring them.", "The conversation took a downward turn from there, and even though none of them said what they were thinking, the evening ended on a grim note. Most evenings did these days, times being what they were.", "", "", ""], "CHAPTER TWO": ["CHAPTER TWO", "A Beautiful Day", "\nIt was one of those perfect autumn days so common in stories and so rare in the real world. The weather was warm and dry, ideal for ripening a field of wheat or corn. On both sides of the road the trees were changing color. Tall poplars had gone a buttery yellow while the shrubby sumac encroaching on the road was tinged a violent red. Only the old oaks seemed reluctant to give up the summer, and their leaves remained an even mingling of gold and green.", "Everything said, you couldn\u2019t hope for a nicer day to have a half dozen ex-soldiers with hunting bows relieve you of everything you owned.", "\u201cShe\u2019s not much of a horse, sir,\u201d Chronicler said. \u201cOne small step above a dray, and when it rains she\u2014\u201d", "The man cut him off with a sharp gesture. \u201cListen friend, the king\u2019s army is paying good money for anything with four legs and at least one eye. If you were stark mad and riding a hobbyhorse down the road, I\u2019d still take it off you.\u201d", "Their leader had an air of command about him. Chronicler guessed he had been a low ranking officer not long ago. \u201cJust hop down,\u201d he said seriously. \u201cWe\u2019ll get this done with and you can be on your way.\u201d", "Chronicler climbed down from his horse. He had been robbed before and knew when there was nothing to be gained by discussion. These fellows knew their business. No energy was wasted on bravado or idle threats. One of them looked over the horse, checking hooves, teeth, and harness. Two others went through his saddlebags with a military efficiency, laying all his worldly possessions out on the ground. Two blankets, a hooded cloak, the flat leather satchel, and his heavy, well-stocked travelsack.", "\u201cThat\u2019s all of it, Commander,\u201d one of the men said. \u201cExcept for about twenty pounds of oats.\u201d", "The commander knelt down and opened the flat leather satchel, peering inside.", "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing but paper and pens in there,\u201d Chronicler said.", "The commander turned to look backward over his shoulder. \u201cYou a scribe then?\u201d", "Chronicler nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s my livelihood, sir. And no real use to you.\u201d", "The man looked through the satchel, found it to be true, and set it aside. Then he upended the travelsack onto Chronicler\u2019s spread cloak and poked idly through the contents.", "He took most of Chronicler\u2019s salt and a pair of bootlaces. Then, much to the scribe\u2019s dismay, he picked up the shirt Chronicler had bought back in Linwood. It was fine linen dyed a deep, royal blue, too nice for traveling. Chronicler hadn\u2019t even had the chance to wear it yet. He sighed.", "The commander left everything else lying on the cloak and got to his feet. The others took turns going through Chronicler\u2019s things.", "The commander spoke up, \u201cYou only have one blanket, don\u2019t you Janns?\u201d One of the men nodded. \u201cTake one of his then, you\u2019ll need a second before winter\u2019s through.\u201d", "\u201cHis cloak is in better shape than mine, sir.\u201d", "\u201cTake it, but leave yours. The same for you, Witkins. Leave your old tin-derbox if you\u2019re taking his.\u201d", "\u201cI lost mine, sir,\u201d Witkins said. \u201cElse I would.\u201d", "The whole process was surprisingly civilized. Chronicler lost all of his needles but one, both extra pairs of socks, a bundle of dried fruit, a loaf of sugar, half a bottle of alcohol, and a pair of ivory dice. They left him the rest of his clothes, his dried meat, and a half-eaten loaf of incredibly stale rye bread. His flat leather satchel remained untouched.", "While the men repacked his travelsack, the commander turned to Chronicler. \u201cLet\u2019s have the purse then.\u201d", "Chronicler handed it over.", "\u201cAnd the ring.\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s hardly any silver in it,\u201d Chronicler mumbled as he unscrewed it from his finger.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s that around your neck?\u201d", "Chronicler unbuttoned his shirt, revealing a dull ring of metal hanging from a leather cord. \u201cJust iron, sir.\u201d", "The commander came close and rubbed it between his fingers before letting it fall back against Chronicler\u2019s chest. \u201cKeep it then. I\u2019m not one to come between a man and his religion,\u201d he said, then emptied the purse into one hand, making a pleasantly surprised noise as he prodded through the coins with his finger. \u201cScribing pays better than I thought,\u201d he said as he began to count out shares to his men.", "\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you could spare me a penny or two out of that?\u201d Chronicler asked. \u201cJust enough for a couple of hot meals?\u201d", "The six men turned to look at Chronicler, as if they couldn\u2019t quite believe what they had heard.", "The commander laughed. \u201cGod\u2019s body, you certainly have a heavy pair, don\u2019t you?\u201d There was a grudging respect in his voice.", "\u201cYou seem a reasonable fellow,\u201d Chronicler said with a shrug. \u201cAnd a man\u2019s got to eat.\u201d", "Their leader smiled for the first time. \u201cA sentiment I can agree with.\u201d He took out two pennies and brandished them before putting them back into Chronicler\u2019s purse. \u201cHere\u2019s a pair for your pair, then.\u201d He tossed Chronicler the purse and stuffed the beautiful royal-blue shirt into his saddlebag.", "\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d Chronicler said. \u201cYou might want to know that that bottle one of your men took is wood alcohol I use for cleaning my pens. It\u2019ll go badly if he drinks it.\u201d", "The commander smiled and nodded. \u201cYou see what comes of treating people well?\u201d he said to his men as he pulled himself up onto his horse. \u201cIt\u2019s been a pleasure, sir scribe. If you get on your way now, you can still make Abbott\u2019s Ford by dark.\u201d", "When Chronicler could no longer hear their hoofbeats in the distance, he repacked his travelsack, making sure everything was well stowed. Then he tugged off one of his boots, stripped out the lining, and removed a tightly wrapped bundle of coins stuffed deep into the toe. He moved some of these into his purse, then unfastened his pants, produced another bundle of coins from underneath several layers of clothes, and moved some of that money into his purse as well.", "The key was to keep the proper amount in your purse. Too little and they would be disappointed and prone to look for more. Too much and they would be excited and might get greedy.", "There was a third bundle of coins baked into the stale loaf of bread that only the most desperate of criminals would be interested in. He left that alone for now, as well as the whole silver talent he had hidden in ajar of ink.", "Over the years he had come to think of the last as more of a luck piece. No one had ever found that.", "He had to admit, it was probably the most civil robbery he\u2019d ever been through. They had been genteel, efficient, and not terribly savvy. Losing the horse and saddle was hard, but he could buy another in Abbott\u2019s Ford and still have enough money to live comfortably until he finished this foolishness and met up with Skarpi in Treya.", "Feeling an urgent call of nature, Chronicler pushed his way through the bloodred sumac at the side of the road. As he was rebuttoning his pants, there was sudden motion in the underbrush as a dark shape thrashed its way free of some nearby bushes.", "Chronicler staggered back, crying out in alarm before he realized it was nothing more than a crow beating its wings into flight. Chuckling at his own foolishness, he straightened his clothes and made his way back to the road through the sumac, brushing away invisible strands of spiderweb that clung tickling to his face.", "As he shouldered his travelsack and satchel, Chronicler found himself feeling remarkably lighthearted. The worst had happened, and it hadn\u2019t been that bad. A breeze tussled through the trees, sending poplar leaves spinning like golden coins down onto the rutted dirt road. It was a beautiful day.", "", "", ""], "CHAPTER THREE": ["CHAPTER THREE", "Wood and Word", "\nKote was leafing idly through a book, trying to ignore the silence of the empty inn when the door opened and Graham backed into the room.", "\u201cJust got done with it.\u201d Graham maneuvered through the maze of tables with exaggerated care. \u201cI was gonna bring it in last night, but then I thought \u2018one last coat of oil, rub it, and let dry.\u2019 Can\u2019t say I\u2019m sorry I did. Lord and lady, it\u2019s beautiful as anything these hands have ever made.\u201d", "A small line formed between the innkeeper\u2019s eyebrows.

He saw Graham watching him and hurried to add, \u201cThat can be a lifetime if you\u2019re waiting for something.\u201d He tried to smile reassuringly, but it came out sickly.", "In fact, Kote himself seemed rather sickly. Not exactly unhealthy, but hollow. Wan. Like a plant that\u2019s been moved into the wrong sort of soil and, lacking something vital, has begun to wilt.", "Graham noted the difference. The innkeeper\u2019s gestures weren\u2019t as extravagant. His voice wasn\u2019t as deep. Even his eyes weren\u2019t as bright as they had been a month ago. Their color seemed duller. They were less sea-foam, less green-grass than they had been. Now they were like riverweed, like the bottom of a green glass bottle. And his hair had been bright before, the color of flame. Now it seemed\u2014red. Just red-hair color, really.", "Kote drew back the cloth and looked underneath. The wood was a dark charcoal color with a black grain, heavy as a sheet of iron. Three dark pegs were set above a word chiseled into the wood.", "\u201cFolly,\u201d Graham read. \u201cOdd name for a sword.\u201d", "Kote nodded, his face carefully blank. \u201cHow much do I owe you?\u201d he asked quietly.", "Graham thought for a moment. \u201cAfter what ye\u2019ve given me to cover the cost of the wood ...\u201d There was a cunning glimmer in the man\u2019s eye. \u201cAround one and three.\u201d", "Kote handed over two talents. \u201cKeep the rest. It\u2019s difficult wood to work with.\u201d", "\u201cThat it is,\u201d Graham said with some satisfaction. \u201cLike stone under the saw. Try a chisel, like iron. Then, after all the shouting was done, I couldn\u2019t char it.\u201d", "\u201cI noticed that,\u201d Kote said with a flicker of curiosity, running a finger along the darker groove the letters made in the wood. \u201cHow did you manage it?\u201d", "\u201cWell,\u201d Graham said smugly, \u201cafter wasting half a day, I took it over to the smithy. Me and the boy managed to sear it with a hot iron. Took us better than two hours to get it black. Not a wisp of smoke, but it made a stink like old leather and clover. Damnedest thing. What sort of wood don\u2019t burn?\u201d", "Graham waited a minute, but the innkeeper gave no signs of having heard. \u201cWhere would\u2019e like me to hang it then?\u201d", "Kote roused himself enough to look around the room. \u201cYou can leave that to me, I think. I haven\u2019t quite decided where to put it.\u201d", "Graham left a handful of iron nails and bid the innkeeper good day. Kote remained at the bar, idly running his hands over the wood and the word.

My greatest successes came from decisions I made when I stopped thinking and simply did what felt right. Even if there was no good explanation for what I did.\u201d He smiled wistfully. \u201cEven if there were very good reasons for me not to do what I did.\u201d", "Bast ran a hand along the side of his face. \u201cSo you\u2019re trying to avoid second-guessing yourself?\u201d", "Kote hesitated. \u201cYou could say that,\u201d he admitted.", "\u201cI could say that, Reshi,\u201d Bast said smugly \u201cYou, on the other hand, would complicate things needlessly.\u201d", "Kote shrugged and turned his eyes back to the mounting board. \u201cNothing to do but find a place for it, I suppose.\u201d", "\u201cOut here?\u201d Bast\u2019s expression was horrified.", "Kote grinned wickedly, a measure of vitality coming back into his face. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said, seeming to savor Bast\u2019s reaction. He looked speculatively at the walls and pursed his lips. \u201cWhere did you put it, anyway?\u201d", "\u201cIn my room,\u201d Bast admitted. \u201cUnder my bed.\u201d", "Kote nodded distractedly, still looking at the walls. \u201cGo get it then.\u201d He made a small shooing gesture with one hand, and Bast hurried off, looking unhappy.", "The bar was decorated with glittering bottles, and Kote was standing on the now-vacant counter between the two heavy oak barrels when Bast came back into the room, black scabbard swinging loosely from one hand.", "Kote paused in the act of setting the mounting board atop one of the barrels and cried out in dismay, \u201cCareful, Bast! You\u2019re carrying a lady there, not swinging some wench at a barn dance.\u201d", "Bast stopped in his tracks and dutifully gathered it up in both hands before walking the rest of the way to the bar.", "Kote pounded a pair of nails into the wall, twisted some wire, and hung the mounting board firmly on the wall. \u201cHand it up, would you?\u201d he asked with an odd catch in his voice.", "Using both hands, Bast held it up to him, looking for a moment like a squire offering up a sword to some bright-armored knight. But there was no knight there, just an innkeeper, just a man in an apron who called himself Kote. He took the sword from Bast and stood upright on the counter behind the bar.", "He drew the sword without a flourish. It shone a dull grey-white in the room\u2019s autumn light. It had the appearance of a new sword. It was not notched or rusted. There were no bright scratches skittering along its dull grey side. But though it was unmarred, it was old. And while it was obviously a sword, it was not a familiar shape. At least no one in this town would have found it familiar. It looked as if an alchemist had distilled a dozen swords, and when the crucible had cooled this was lying in the bottom: a sword in its pure form. It was slender and graceful. It was deadly as a sharp stone beneath swift water.", "Kote held it a moment. His hand did not shake.", "Then he set the sword on the mounting board. Its grey-white metal shone against the dark roah behind it. While the handle could be seen, it was dark enough to be almost indistinguishable from the wood. The word beneath it, black against blackness, seemed to reproach: Folly.", "Kote climbed down, and for a moment he and Bast stood side by side, silently looking up.", "Bast broke the silence. \u201cIt is rather striking,\u201d he said, as if he regretted the truth. \u201cBut...\u201d He trailed off, trying to find appropriate words. He shuddered.", "Kote clapped him on the back, oddly cheerful. \u201cDon\u2019t bother being disturbed on my account.\u201d He seemed more lively now, as if his activity lent him energy. \u201cI like it,\u201d he said with sudden conviction, and hung the black scabbard from one of the mounting board\u2019s pegs.", "Then there were things to be done. Bottles to be polished and put back in place. Lunch to be made. Lunch clutter to be cleaned. Things were cheerful for a while in a pleasant, bustling way. The two talked of small matters as they worked. And while they moved around a great deal, it was obvious they were reluctant to finish whatever task they were close to completing, as if they both dreaded the moment when the work would end and the silence would fill the room again.", "Then something odd happened. The door opened and noise poured into the Waystone like a gentle wave. People bustled in, talking and dropping bundles of belongings. They chose tables and threw their coats over the backs of chairs. One man, wearing a shirt of heavy metal rings, unbuckled a sword and leaned it against a wall. Two or three wore knives on their belts. Four or five called for drinks.", "Kote and Bast watched for a moment, then moved smoothly into action. Kote smiled and began pouring drinks. Bast darted outside to see if there were horses that needed stabling.", "In ten minutes the inn was a different place. Coins rang on the bar. Cheese and fruit were set on platters and a large copper pot was hung to simmer in the kitchen. Men moved tables and chairs about to better suit their group of nearly a dozen people.", "Kote identified them as they came in. Two men and two women, wagoneers, rough from years of being outside and smiling to be spending a night out of the wind. Three guards with hard eyes, smelling of iron. A tinker with a potbelly and a ready smile showing his few remaining teeth. Two young men, one sandy-haired, one dark, well dressed and well-spoken: travelers sensible enough to hook up with a larger group for protection on the road.", "The settling-in period lasted an hour or two. Prices of rooms were dickered over. Friendly arguments started about who slept with whom. Minor necessities were brought in from wagons or saddlebags. Baths were requested and water heated. Hay was taken to the horses, and Kote topped off the oil in all the lamps.", "The tinker hurried outside to make use of the remaining daylight. He walked his two-wheel mule cart through the town\u2019s streets. Children crowded around, begging for candy and stories and shims.", "When it became apparent that nothing was going to be handed out, most of them lost interest. They formed a circle with a boy in the middle and started to clap, keeping the beat with a children\u2019s song that had been ages old when their grandparents had chanted it:", "\u201cWhen the hearthfire turns to blue,", "What to do? What to do?", "Run outside. Run and hide.\u201d", "", "", "Laughing, the boy in the middle tried to break out of the circle while the other children pushed him back.", "\u201cTinker,\u201d the old man\u2019s voice rang out like a bell. \u201cPot mender. Knife grinder. Willow-wand water-finder. Cut cork. Motherleaf. Silk scarves off the city streets. Writing paper. Sweetmeats.\u201d", "This drew the attention of the children. They flocked back to him, making a small parade as he walked down the street, singing, \u201cBelt leather. Black pepper. Fine lace and bright feather. Tinker in town tonight, gone tomorrow. Working through the evening light. Come wife. Come daughter, I\u2019ve small cloth and rose water.\u201d After a couple of minutes he settled outside the Waystone, set up his sharpening wheel and began to grind a knife.", "As the adults began to gather around the old man, the children returned to their game. A girl in the center of the circle put one hand over her eyes and tried to catch the other children as they ran away, clapping and chanting:", "\u201cWhen his eyes are black as crow?", "Where to go? Where to go?", "Near and far. Here they are.\u201d", "", "", "The tinker dealt with everyone in turn, sometimes two or three at a time. He traded sharp knives for dull ones and a small coin. He sold shears and needles, copper pots and small bottles that wives hid quickly after buying them. He traded buttons and bags of cinnamon and salt. Limes from Tinu\u00eb, chocolate from Tarbean, polished horn from Aerueh....", "All the while the children continued to sing:", "\u201cSee a man without a face?", "Move like ghosts from place to place.", "What\u2019s their plan? What\u2019s their plan?", "Chandrian. Chandrian.\u201d", "", "", "Kote guessed the travelers had been together a month or so, long enough to become comfortable with each other, but not long enough to be squabbling over small things. They smelled of road dust and horses. He breathed it in like perfume.", "Best of all was the noise. Leather creaking. Men laughing. The fire cracked and spat. The women flirted. Someone even knocked over a chair. For the first time in a long while there was no silence in the Waystone Inn. Or if there was, it was too faint to be noticed, or too well hidden.", "Kote was in the middle of it all, always moving, like a man tending a large, complex machine. Ready with a drink just as a person called for it, he talked and listened in the right amounts. He laughed at jokes, shook hands, smiled, and whisked coins off the bar as if he truly needed the money.", "Then, when the time for songs came and everyone had sung their favorites and still wanted more, Kote led them from behind the bar, clapping to keep a beat. With the fire shining in his hair, he sang \u201cTinker Tanner,\u201d more verses than anyone had heard before, and no one minded in the least.", "", "Hours later, the common room had a warm, jovial feel to it. Kote was kneeling on the hearth, building up the fire, when someone spoke behind him.", "\u201cKvothe?\u201d", "The innkeeper turned, wearing a slightly confused smile. \u201cSir?\u201d", "It was one of the well-dressed travelers. He swayed a little. \u201cYou\u2019re Kvothe.\u201d", "\u201cKote, sir,\u201d Kote replied in an indulgent tone that mothers use on children and innkeepers use on drunks.", "\u201cKvothe the Bloodless.\u201d The man pressed ahead with the dogged persistence of the inebriated. \u201cYou looked familiar, but I couldn\u2019t finger it.\u201d He smiled proudly and tapped a finger to his nose. \u201cThen I heard you sing, and I knew it was you. I heard you in Imre once. Cried my eyes out afterward. I never heard anything like that before or since. Broke my heart.\u201d", "The young man\u2019s sentences grew jumbled as he continued, but his face remained earnest. \u201cI knew it couldn\u2019t be you. But I thought it was. Even though. But who else has your hair?\u201d He shook his head, trying unsuccessfully to clear it. \u201cI saw the place in Imre where you killed him. By the fountain. The cobblestones are all shathered.\u201d He frowned and concentrated on the word. \u201cShattered. They say no one can mend them.\u201d", "The sandy-haired man paused again. Squinting for focus, he seemed surprised by the innkeeper\u2019s reaction.", "The red-haired man was grinning. \u201cAre you saying I look like Kvothe? The Kvothe? I\u2019ve always thought so myself. I have an engraving of him in back. My assistant teases me for it. Would you tell him what you just told me?\u201d", "Kote threw a final log onto the fire and stood. But as he stepped from the hearth, one of his legs twisted underneath him and he fell heavily to the floor, knocking over a chair.", "Several of the travelers hurried over, but the innkeeper was already on his feet, waving people back to their seats. \u201cNo, no. I\u2019m fine. Sorry to startle anyone.\u201d In spite of his grin it was obvious he\u2019d hurt himself. His face was tight with pain, and he leaned heavily on a chair for support.", "\u201cTook an arrow in the knee on my way through the Eld three summers ago. It gives out every now and then.\u201d He grimaced and said wistfully, \u201cIt\u2019s what made me give up the good life on the road.\u201d He reached down to touch his oddly bent leg tenderly.", "One of the mercenaries spoke up. \u201cI\u2019d put a poultice on that, or it\u2019ll swell terrible.\u201d", "Kote touched it again and nodded. \u201cI think you are wise, sir.\u201d He turned to the sandy-haired man who stood swaying slightly by the fireplace, \u201cCould you do me a favor, son?\u201d", "The man nodded dumbly.", "\u201cJust close the flue.\u201d Kote gestured toward the fireplace. \u201cBast, will you help me upstairs?\u201d", "Bast hurried over and drew Kote\u2019s arm around his shoulders. Kote leaned on him with every other step as they made their way through the doorway and up the stairs.", "\u201cArrow in the leg?\u201d Bast asked under his breath. \u201cAre you really that embarrassed from taking a little fall?\u201d", "\u201cThank God you\u2019re as gullible as they are,\u201d Kote said sharply as soon as they were out of sight. He began to curse under his breath as he climbed a few more steps, his knee obviously uninjured.", "Bast\u2019s eyes widened, then narrowed.", "Kote stopped at the top of the steps and rubbed his eyes. \u201cOne of them knows who I am.\u201d Kote frowned. \u201cSuspects.\u201d", "\u201cWhich one?\u201d Bast asked with a mix of apprehension and anger.", "\u201cGreen shirt, sandy hair. The one nearest to me by the fireplace. Give him something to make him sleep. He\u2019s already been drinking. No one will think twice if he happens to pass out.\u201d", "Bast thought briefly. \u201cNighmane?\u201d", "\u201cMhenka.\u201d", "Bast raised an eyebrow, but nodded.", "Kote straightened. \u201cListen three times, Bast.\u201d", "Bast blinked once and nodded.", "Kote spoke crisply and cleanly. \u201cI was a city-licensed escort from Ralien. Wounded while successfully defending a caravan. Arrow in right knee. Three years ago. Summer. A grateful Cealdish merchant gave me money to start an inn. His name is Deolan. We were traveling from Purvis. Mention it casually. Do you have it?\u201d", "\u201cI hear you three times, Reshi,\u201d Bast replied formally.", "\u201cGo.\u201d", "", "Half an hour later Bast brought a bowl to his master\u2019s room, reassuring him that everything was well downstairs. Kote nodded and gave terse instructions that he not be disturbed for the rest of the night.", "Closing the door behind himself, Bast\u2019s expression was worried. He stood at the top of the stairs for some time, trying to think of something he could do.", "It is hard to say what troubled Bast so much. Kote didn\u2019t seem noticeably changed in any way. Except, perhaps, that he moved a little slower, and whatever small spark the night\u2019s activity had lit behind his eyes was dimmer now. In fact, it could hardly be seen. In fact, it may not have been there at all.", "Kote sat in front of the fire and ate his meal mechanically, as if he were simply finding a place inside himself to keep the food. After the last bite he sat staring into nothing, not remembering what he had eaten or what it tasted like.", "The fire snapped, making him blink and look around the room. He looked down at his hands, one curled inside the other, resting in his lap. After a moment, he lifted and spread them, as if warming them by the fire. They were graceful, with long, delicate fingers. He watched them intently, as if expecting them to do something on their own. Then he lowered them to his lap, one hand lightly cupping the other, and returned to watching the fire. Expressionless, motionless, he sat until there was nothing left but grey ash and dully glowing coals.", "As he was undressing for bed, the fire flared. The red light traced faint lines across his body, across his back and arms. All the scars were smooth and silver, streaking him like lightning, like lines of gentle remembering. The flare of flame revealed them all briefly, old wounds and new. All the scars were smooth and silver except one.", "The fire flickered and died. Sleep met him like a lover in an empty bed.", "", "The travelers left early the next morning. Bast tended to their needs, explaining his master\u2019s knee was swollen quite badly and he didn\u2019t feel up to taking the stairs so early in the day Everyone understood except for the sandy-haired merchant\u2019s son, who was too groggy to understand much of anything. The guards exchanged smiles and rolled their eyes while the tinker gave an impromptu sermon on the subject of temperance. Bast recommended several unpleasant hangover cures.", "After they left, Bast tended to the inn, which was no great chore, as there were no customers. Most of his time was spent trying to find ways to amuse himself.", "Some time after noon, Kote came down the stairs to find him crushing walnuts on the bar with a heavy leather-bound book. \u201cGood morning, Reshi.\u201d", "\u201cGood morning, Bast,\u201d Kote said. \u201cAny news?\u201d", "\u201cThe Orrison boy stopped by. Wanted to know if we needed any mutton.\u201d", "Kote nodded, almost as if he had been suspecting the news. \u201cHow much did you order?\u201d", "Bast made a face. \u201cI hate mutton, Reshi. It tastes like wet mittens.\u201d", "Kote shrugged and made his way to the door. \u201cI\u2019ve got some errands to run. Keep an eye on things, will you?\u201d", "\u201cI always do.\u201d", "Outside the Waystone Inn the air lay still and heavy on the empty dirt road that ran through the center of town. The sky was a featureless grey sheet of cloud that looked as if it wanted to rain but couldn\u2019t quite work up the energy.", "Kote walked across the street to the open front of the smithy. The smith wore his hair cropped short and his beard thick and bushy. As Kote watched, he carefully drove a pair of nails through a scythe blade\u2019s collar, fixing it firmly onto a curved wooden handle. \u201cHello Caleb.\u201d", "The smith leaned the scythe up against the wall. \u201cWhat can I do for you, Master Kote?\u201d", "\u201cDid the Orrison boy stop by your place too?\u201d Caleb nodded. \u201cThey still losing sheep?\u201d Kote asked.", "\u201cActually, some of the lost ones finally turned up. Torn up awful, practically shredded.\u201d", "\u201cWolves?\u201d Kote asked.", "The smith shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s the wrong time of year, but what else would it be? A bear?

Just plain old pig-iron would do nicely.\u201d", "Caleb chuckled. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if you were going to stop by at all. Old Cob and the rest came by day before yesterday.\u201d He walked over to a workbench and lifted up a piece of canvas. \u201cI made a couple extras just in case.\u201d", "Kote picked up a rod of iron about two feet long and swung it casually with one hand. \u201cClever man.\u201d", "\u201cI know my business,\u201d the smith said smugly. \u201cYou need anything else?\u201d", "\u201cActually,\u201d Kote said as he settled the bar of iron comfortably against his shoulder, \u201cThere is one other thing. Do you have a spare apron and set of forge gloves?\u201d", "\u201cCould have,\u201d Caleb said hesitantly. \u201cWhy?\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s an old bramble patch behind the inn.\u201d Kote nodded in the direction of the Waystone. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of tearing it up so I can put in a garden next year. But I don\u2019t fancy losing half my skin doing it.\u201d", "The smith nodded and gestured for Kote to follow him into the back of the shop. \u201cI\u2019ve got my old set,\u201d he said as he dug out a pair of heavy gloves and a stiff leather apron; both were charred dark in places and stained with grease. \u201cThey\u2019re not pretty, but they\u2019ll keep the worst of it off you, I suppose.\u201d", "\u201cWhat are they worth to you?\u201d Kote asked, reaching for his purse.", "The smith shook his head, \u201cA jot would be a great plenty. They\u2019re no good to me or the boy.\u201d", "The innkeeper handed over a coin and the smith stuffed them into an old burlap sack. \u201cYou sure you want to do it now?\u201d The smith asked. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had rain in a while. The ground\u2019ll be softer after the spring thaw.\u201d", "Kote shrugged. \u201cMy granda always told me that fall\u2019s the time to root up something you don\u2019t want coming back to trouble you.\u201d Kote mimicked the quaver of an old man\u2019s voice. \u201c \u2018Things are too full of life in the spring months. In the summer, they\u2019re too strong and won\u2019t let go. Autumn", "He looked around at the changing leaves on the trees. \u201c \u2018Autumn\u2019s the time. In autumn everything is tired and ready to die.\u2019 \u201d", "", "Later that afternoon Kote sent Bast to catch up on his sleep.

Kote knew with bleak certainty how long winter would be.", "He closed the inn early, something he had never done before. He didn\u2019t bother sweeping. The floor didn\u2019t need it. He didn\u2019t wash the tables or the bar, none had been used. He polished a bottle or two, locked the door, and went to bed.", "There was no one around to notice the difference.

Yesterday he had limped, but today there was no part of his feet that didn\u2019t hurt, so limping did no good.

But in small towns like these, people didn\u2019t have horses to spare, especially not with harvest fast approaching.", "Despite a hard day\u2019s walking, he was still on the road when night fell, making the rutted dirt road a stumbling ground of half-seen shapes. After two hours of fumbling through the dark, Chronicler saw light flickering through the trees and abandoned any thought of making it to Newarre that night, deciding a farmstead\u2019s hospitality would be welcome enough.", "He left the road, blundering through the trees toward the light. But the fire was farther away than he had thought, and larger. It wasn\u2019t lamplight from a house, or even sparks from a campfire. It was a bonfire roaring in the ruins of an old house, little more than two crumbling stone walls. Huddled into the corner those two walls made was a man. He wore a heavy hooded cloak, bundled up as if it were full winter and not a mild autumn evening.", "Chronicler\u2019s hopes rose at the sight of a small cook fire with a pot hanging over it. But as he came close, he caught a foul scent mingling with the woodsmoke. It reeked of burning hair and rotting flowers. Chronicler quickly decided that whatever the man was cooking in the iron pot, he wanted none of it. Still, even a place next to a fire was better than curling up by the side of the road.", "Chronicler stepped into the circle of firelight. \u201cI saw your f\u2014\u201d He stopped as the figure sprang quickly to its feet, a sword held with both hands.", "No, not a sword, a long, dark cudgel of some sort, too regularly shaped to be a piece of firewood.", "Chronicler stopped dead in his tracks. \u201cI was just looking for a place to sleep,\u201d he said quickly, his hand unconsciously clutching at the circle of iron that hung around his neck. \u201cI don\u2019t want any trouble. I\u2019ll leave you to your dinner.\u201d He took a step backward.", "The figure relaxed, and the cudgel dropped to grate metallically against a stone. \u201cCharred body of God, what are you doing out here at this time of night?\u201d", "\u201cI was headed to Newarre and saw your fire.\u201d", "\u201cYou just followed a strange fire into the woods at night?\u201d The hooded figure shook his head. \u201cYou might as well come here.\u201d He motioned Chronicler closer, and the scribe saw he was wearing thick leather gloves. \u201cTehlu anyway, have you had bad luck your whole life, or have you been saving it all up for tonight?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know who you\u2019re waiting for,\u201d Chronicler said, taking a step backward. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure you\u2019d rather do it alone.\u201d", "\u201cShut up and listen,\u201d the man said sharply \u201cI don\u2019t know how much time we have.\u201d He looked down and rubbed at his face. \u201cGod, I never know how much to tell you people.

In the firelight his hair was impossibly red, his eyes a shocking, vibrant green. He looked at Chronicler, sizing him up. \u201cDemons,\u201d he said. \u201cDemons in the shape of big, black spiders.\u201d", "Chronicler relaxed. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as demons.\u201d From his tone it was obvious he\u2019d said the same thing many, many times before.", "The red-haired man gave an incredulous laugh. \u201cWell, I guess we can all go home then!\u201d He flashed a manic grin at Chronicler. \u201cListen, I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re an educated man. I respect that, and for the most part, you\u2019re right.\u201d His expression went serious. \u201cBut here and now, tonight, you\u2019re wrong. Wrong as wrong can be.

If one of them gets on you, just fall down. Try to land on it, crush it with your body. Roll on it. If you get hold of one, throw it into the fire.\u201d", "He drew the hood back over his head, speaking quickly. \u201cIf you have any extra clothes, put them on. If you have a blanket you could wrap\u2014\u201d", "He stopped suddenly and looked out across the circle of firelight. \u201cGet your back against the wall,\u201d he said abruptly, bringing his iron cudgel up with both hands.", "Chronicler looked past the bonfire. Something dark was moving in the trees.", "They came into the light, moving low across the ground: black shapes, many-legged and large as cart wheels. One, quicker than the rest, rushed into the firelight without hesitating, moving with the disturbing, sinuous speed of a scuttling insect.", "Before Chronicler could raise his piece of firewood, the thing skirted sideways around the bonfire and sprang at him, quick as a cricket. Chronicler threw up his hands just as the black thing struck his face and chest. Its cold, hard legs scrabbled for a hold and he felt bright stripes of pain across the backs of his arm. Staggering away, the scribe felt his heel snag on the rough ground, and he began to topple over backward, arms flailing wildly.", "As he fell, Chronicler caught one last glimpse of the circle of firelight. More of the black things were scuttling out of the dark, their feet beating a quick staccato rhythm against roots and rocks and leaves. On the other side of the fire the man in the heavy cloak held his iron cudgel ready with both hands. He stood perfectly still, perfectly silent, waiting.", "Still falling backward with the dark thing on top of him, Chronicler felt a dull, dark explosion as the back of his head struck the stone wall behind him. The world slowed, turned blurry, then black.", "", "Chronicler opened his eyes to a confusing mass of dark shapes and firelight. His skull throbbed. There were several lines of bright, clear pain crossing the backs of his arms and a dull ache that pulled at his left side every time he drew in a breath.", "After a long moment of concentration the world came into a blurry focus. The bundled man sat nearby. He was no longer wearing his gloves, and his heavy cloak hung off his body in loose tatters, but other than that he seemed unscathed. His hood was up, hiding his face.", "\u201cYou\u2019re awake?\u201d the man asked curiously. \u201cThat\u2019s good. You can never be sure with a head wound.\u201d The hood tilted a bit. \u201cCan you talk? Do you know where you are?\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d Chronicler said thickly. It seemed to take far too much effort to make a single word.", "\u201cEven better. Now, third time pays for all. Do you think you can stand up and lend me a hand? We need to burn and bury the bodies.\u201d", "Chronicler moved his head a bit and felt suddenly dizzy and nauseous. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d", "\u201cI might have broken a couple of your ribs,\u201d the man said. \u201cOne of them was all over you. I didn\u2019t have a lot of options.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, for whatever that\u2019s worth. I\u2019ve already stitched up the cuts on your arms. They should heal up nicely\u201d", "\u201cThey\u2019re gone?\u201d", "The hood nodded once. \u201cThe scrael don\u2019t retreat. They\u2019re like wasps from a hive. They keep attacking until they die.\u201d", "A horrified look spread over Chronicler\u2019s face. \u201cThere\u2019s a hive of these things?\u201d", "\u201cDear God, no. There were just these five. Still, we have to burn and bury them, just to be sure. I already cut the wood we\u2019ll need: ash and rowan.\u201d", "Chronicler gave a laugh that sounded slightly hysterical. \u201cJust like the children\u2019s song:", "\u201cLet me tell you what to do.", "Dig a pit that\u2019s ten by two.", "Ash and elm and rowan too\u2014\u201d", "", "", "\u201cYes indeed,\u201d the bundled man said dryly. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised at the sorts of things hidden away in children\u2019s songs. But while I don\u2019t think we need to dig the entire ten feet down, I wouldn\u2019t refuse a little help....\u201d He trailed off meaningfully", "Chronicler moved one hand to feel the back of his head gingerly, then looked at his fingers, surprised that they weren\u2019t covered in blood. \u201cI think I\u2019m fine,\u201d he said as he cautiously levered himself up onto one elbow and from there into a sitting position. \u201cIs there any\u2014\u201d His eyes flickered and he went limp, falling bonelessly backward. His head struck the ground, bounced once, and came to rest tilted slightly to one side.", "", "Kote sat patiently for a few long moments, watching the unconscious man. When there was no movement other than the chest slowly rising and falling, he came stiffly to his feet and knelt at Chronicler\u2019s side. Kote lifted one eyelid, then the other and grunted at what he saw, not seeming particularly surprised.", "\u201cI don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s any chance of you waking up again?\u201d he asked without much hope in his voice. He tapped Chronicler\u2019s pale cheek lightly. \u201cNo chance at\u2014\u201d A drop of blood spotted Chronicler\u2019s forehead, followed quickly by another.", "Kote straightened up so that he was no longer leaning over the unconscious man and wiped the blood away as best he could, which wasn\u2019t very well, as his hands were covered in blood themselves. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said absently.", "He gave a deep sigh and pushed back his hood. His red hair was matted down against his head, and half his face was smeared with drying blood. Slowly he began to peel away the tattered remains of his cloak. Underneath was a leather blacksmith\u2019s apron, wildly scored with cuts. He removed that as well, revealing a plain grey shirt of homespun. Both his shoulders and his left arm were dark and wet with blood.", "Kote fingered the buttons of his shirt for a moment, then decided against removing it.

They gaped redly against the innkeeper\u2019s fair skin, as if he had been slashed with a barber\u2019s razor or a piece of broken glass. There were perhaps a dozen cuts in all, most of them on the tops of his shoulders, a few across his back and along his arms.

Home to dozens.\u201d", "Chronicler stared at the red-haired man behind the bar.

I was ... oh. Well even aside from last night, the road\u2019s been pretty rough. I was robbed off by Abbot\u2019s Ford, and I\u2019ve been on foot ever since. But it was all worth it since you\u2019re actually here.\u201d The scribe glanced at the sword hanging over the bar and drew a deep breath, his expression becoming vaguely anxious. \u201cI\u2019m not here to cause trouble, mind you. I\u2019m not here because of the price on your head.\u201d He gave a weak smile. \u201cNot that I could hope to trouble you\u2014\u201d", "\u201cFine,\u201d the innkeeper interupted as he pulled out a white linen cloth and began to polish the bar. \u201cWho are you then?\u201d", "\u201cYou can call me Chronicler.\u201d", "\u201cI didn\u2019t ask what I could call you,\u201d Kote said. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d", "\u201cDevan.

Not a chronicler, the Chronicler.\u201d He stared hard at the balding man, looking him up and down. \u201cHow about that? The great debunker himself.\u201d", "Chronicler relaxed slightly, obviously pleased to have his reputation precede him. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to be difficult before. I haven\u2019t thought of myself as Devan in years. I left that name behind me long ago.\u201d He gave the innkeeper a significant look. \u201cI expect you know something of that yourself....\u201d", "Kote ignored the unspoken question. \u201cI read your book years ago. The Mating Habits of the Common Draccus. Quite the eye-opener for a young man with his head full of stories.\u201d Looking down he began moving the white cloth along the grain of the bar again. \u201cI\u2019ll admit, I was disappointed to learn that dragons didn\u2019t exist. That\u2019s a hard lesson for a boy to learn.\u201d", "Chronicler smiled. \u201cHonestly I was a little disappointed myself. I went looking for a legend and found a lizard.

A room for the night?\u201d", "Chronicler hesitated.", "\u201cI have it all right here.\u201d Kote gestured expansively behind the bar. \u201cOld wine, smooth and pale? Honey mead? Dark ale? Sweet fruit liquor! Plum? Cherry? Green apple? Blackberry?\u201d Kote pointed out the bottles in turn. \u201cCome now, surely you must want something?\u201d As he spoke, his smile widened, showing too many teeth for a friendly innkeeper\u2019s grin. At the same time his eyes grew cold, and hard, and angry.", "Chronicler dropped his gaze. \u201cI\u2019d thought that\u2014\u201d", "\u201cYou thought,\u201d Kote said derisively, dropping all pretense of a smile. \u201cI very much doubt it.

People don\u2019t look for you when you\u2019re dead. Old enemies don\u2019t try to settle scores.

The best lies about me are the ones / told.\u201d", "\u201cThey say you never existed,\u201d Chronicler corrected gently.", "Kote shrugged nonchalantly, his smile fading an imperceptible amount.", "Sensing weakness, Chronicler continued. \u201cSome stories paint you as little more than a red-handed killer.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m that too.\u201d Kote turned to polish the counter behind the bar. He shrugged again, not as easily as before. \u201cI\u2019ve killed men and things that were more than men. Every one of them deserved it.\u201d", "Chronicler shook his head slowly. \u201cThe stories are saying \u2018assassin\u2019 not \u2018hero.\u2019 Kvothe the Arcane and Kvothe Kingkiller are two very different men.\u201d", "Kote stopped polishing the bar and turned his back to the room. He nodded once without looking up.", "\u201cSome are even saying that there is a new Chandrian. A fresh terror in the night. His hair as red as the blood he spills.\u201d", "\u201cThe important people know the difference,\u201d Kote said as if he were trying to convince himself, but his voice was weary and despairing, without conviction.", "Chronicler gave a small laugh. \u201cCertainly For now. But you of all people should realize how thin the line is between the truth and a compelling lie. Between history and an entertaining story.\u201d Chronicler gave his words a minute to sink in. \u201cYou know which will win, given time.\u201d", "Kote remained facing the back wall, hands flat on the counter. His head was bowed slightly, as if a great weight had settled onto him. He did not speak.", "Chronicler took an eager step forward, sensing victory. \u201cSome people say there was a woman\u2014\u201d", "\u201cWhat do they know?\u201d Kote\u2019s voice cut like a saw through bone. \u201cWhat do they know about what happened?\u201d He spoke so softly that Chronicler had to hold his breath to hear.", "\u201cThey say she\u2014\u201d Chronicler\u2019s words stuck in his suddenly dry throat as the room grew unnaturally quiet. Kote stood with his back to the room, a stillness in his body and a terrible silence clenched between his teeth. His right hand, tangled in a clean white cloth, made a slow fist.", "Eight inches away a bottle shattered. The smell of strawberries filled the air alongside the sound of splintering glass. A small noise inside so great a stillness, but it was enough. Enough to break the silence into small, sharp slivers. Chronicler felt himself go cold as he suddenly realized what a dangerous game he was playing. So this is the difference between telling a story and being in one, he thought numbly, the fear.", "Kote turned. \u201cWhat can any of them know about her?\u201d he asked softly. Chronicler\u2019s breath stopped when he saw Kote\u2019s face. The placid innkeeper\u2019s expression was like a shattered mask. Underneath, Kote\u2019s expression was haunted, eyes half in this world, half elsewhere, remembering.", "Chronicler found himself thinking of a story he had heard. One of the many. The story told of how Kvothe had gone looking for his heart\u2019s desire. He had to trick a demon to get it. But once it rested in his hand, he was forced to fight an angel to keep it. I believe it, Chronicler found himself thinking. Before it was just a story, but now I can believe it. This is the face of a man who has killed an angel.", "\u201cWhat can any of them know about me?\u201d Kote demanded, a numb anger in his voice. \u201cWhat can they know about any of this?\u201d He made a short, fierce gesture that seemed to take in everything, the broken bottle, the bar, the world.", "Chronicler swallowed against the dryness in his throat. \u201cOnly what they\u2019re told.\u201d", "Tat tat, tat-tat. Liquor from the broken bottle began to patter an irregular rhythm onto the floor. \u201cAhhhh,\u201d Kote sighed out a long breath. Tat-tat, tat-tat, tat. \u201cClever. You\u2019d use my own best trick against me. You\u2019d hold my story a hostage.\u201d", "\u201cI would tell the truth.\u201d", "\u201cNothing but the truth could break me.

For a long moment, only the gentle tapping of drops against the floor kept the silence at bay.", "Finally Kote walked through the doorway behind the bar. Chronicler stood awkwardly in the empty room, unsure whether or not he had been dismissed.", "A few minutes later Kote returned with a bucket of soapy water. Without looking in the storyteller\u2019s direction, he began to gently, methodically, wash his bottles. One at a time, Kote wiped their bottoms clean of the strawberry wine and set them on the bar between himself and Chronicler, as if they might defend him.", "\u201cSo you went looking for a myth and found a man,\u201d he said without inflection, without looking up. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard the stories and now you want the truth of things.\u201d", "Radiating relief, Chronicler set his satchel down on one of the tables, surprised at the slight tremor in his hands. \u201cWe got wind of you a while back. Just a whisper of a rumor. I didn\u2019t really expect ...\u201d Chronicler paused, suddenly awkward. \u201cI thought you would be older.\u201d", "\u201cI am,\u201d Kote said. Chronicler looked puzzled, but before he could say anything the innkeeper continued. \u201cWhat brings you into this worthless little corner of the world?\u201d", "\u201cAn appointment with the Earl of Baedn-Bryt,\u201d Chronicler said, puffing himself up slightly. \u201cThree days from now, in Treya.\u201d", "The innkeeper paused mid-polish. \u201cYou expect to make it to the earl\u2019s manor in four days?\u201d he asked quietly.", "\u201cI am behind schedule,\u201d Chronicler admitted. \u201cMy horse was stolen near Abbott\u2019s Ford.\u201d He glanced out the window at the darkening sky. \u201cBut I\u2019m willing to lose some sleep. I\u2019ll be off in the morning and out of your hair.\u201d", "\u201cWell I wouldn\u2019t want to cost you any sleep,\u201d Kote said sarcastically, his eyes gone hard again. \u201cI can tell the whole thing in one breath.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201c \u2018I trouped, traveled, loved, lost, trusted and was betrayed.\u201d Write that down and burn it for all the good it will do you.\u201d", "\u201cYou needn\u2019t take it that way,\u201d Chronicler said quickly. \u201cWe can take the whole night if you like. And a few hours in the morning as well.\u201d", "\u201cHow gracious,\u201d Kote snapped. \u201cYou\u2019ll have me tell my story in an evening? With no time to collect myself? No time to prepare?\u201d His mouth made a thin line. \u201cNo. Go dally with your earl. I\u2019ll have none of it.\u201d", "Chronicler spoke quickly, \u201cIf you\u2019re certain you\u2019ll need\u2014\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d Kote set a bottle down hard on the bar, hard. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say I\u2019ll need more time than that. And you\u2019ll get none of it tonight. A real story takes time to prepare.\u201d", "Chronicler frowned nervously and ran his hands through his hair. \u201cI could spend tomorrow collecting your story....\u201d He trailed off at the sight of Kote shaking his head. After a pause he started again, almost talking to himself. \u201cIf I pick up a horse in Baedn, I can give you all day tomorrow, most of the night, and a piece of the following day.\u201d He rubbed his forehead. \u201cI hate riding at night, but\u2014\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll need three days,\u201d Kote said. \u201cI\u2019m quite sure of it.\u201d", "Chronicler blanched. \u201cBut ... the earl.\u201d", "Kote waved a hand dismissively", "\u201cNo one needs three days,\u201d Chronicler said firmly. \u201cI interviewed Oren Velciter. Oren Velciter, mind you. He\u2019s eighty years old, and done two hundred years worth of living. Five hundred, if you count the lies. He sought me out,\u201d Chronicler said with particular emphasis. \u201cHe only took two days.\u201d", "\u201cThat is my offer,\u201d the innkeeper said simply. \u201cI\u2019ll do this properly or not at all.\u201d", "\u201cWait!\u201d Chronicler brightened suddenly. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about this all backward,\u201d he said, shaking his head at his own foolishness. \u201cI\u2019ll just visit the earl, then come back. You can have all the time you like then. I could even bring Skarpi back with me.\u201d", "Kote gave Chronicler a look of profound disdain. \u201cWhat gives you the slightest impression that I would be here when you came back?\u201d he asked incredulously \u201cFor that matter, what makes you think you\u2019re free to simply walk out of here, knowing what you know?\u201d", "Chronicler went very still. \u201cAre\u2014\u201d He swallowed and started again. \u201cAre you saying that\u2014\u201d", "\u201cThe story will take three days,\u201d Kote interrupted. \u201cStarting tomorrow. That is what I am saying.\u201d", "Chronicler closed his eyes and ran his hand over his face. The earl would be furious, of course. No telling what it might take to get back in his good graces. Still ... \u201cIf that\u2019s the only way that I can get it, I accept.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d The innkeeper relaxed into a half smile. \u201cCome now, is three days really so unusual?\u201d", "Chronicler\u2019s serious expression returned. \u201cThree days is quite unusual. But then again\u2014\u201d Some of the self-importance seemed to leak out of him. \u201cThen again,\u201d he made a gesture as if to show how useless words were. \u201cYou are Kvothe.\u201d", "The man who called himself Kote looked up from behind his bottles. A full-lipped smile played about his mouth. A spark was kindling behind his eyes.

It was a cool, fresh light, fitted for beginnings. It brushed past the miller as he set his water-wheel turning for the day. It lit the forge the smith was rekindling after four days of cold metal work. It touched draft horses hitched to wagons and sickle blades glittering sharp and ready at the beginning of an autumn day", "Inside the Waystone, the light fell across Chronicler\u2019s face and touched a beginning there, a blank page waiting the first words of a story. The light flowed across the bar, scattered a thousand tiny rainbow beginnings from the colored bottles, and climbed the wall toward the sword, as if searching for one final beginning.", "But when the light touched the sword there were no beginnings to be seen. In fact, the light the sword reflected was dull, burnished, and ages old. Looking at it, Chronicler remembered that though it was the beginning of a day, it was also late autumn and growing colder. The sword shone with the knowledge that dawn was a small beginning compared to the ending of a season: the ending of a year.", "Chronicler pulled his eyes away from the sword, aware that Kvothe had said something, but not knowing what. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d", "\u201cHow do people normally go about relating their stories?\u201d Kvothe asked.", "Chronicler shrugged. \u201cMost simply tell me what they remember. Later, I record events in the proper order, remove the unnecessary pieces, clarify, simplify, that sort of thing.\u201d", "Kvothe frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t think that will do.\u201d", "Chronicler gave him a shy smile. \u201cStorytellers are always different. They prefer their stories be left alone. But they also prefer an attentive audience. I usually listen and record later. I have a nearly perfect memory.\u201d", "\u201cNearly perfect doesn\u2019t quite suit me.\u201d Kvothe pressed a finger against his lips. \u201cHow fast can you write?\u201d", "Chronicler gave a knowing smile. \u201cFaster than a man can talk.\u201d", "Kvothe raised an eyebrow. \u201cI\u2019d like to see that.\u201d", "Chronicler opened his satchel. He brought out a stack of fine, white paper and a bottle of ink. After arranging them carefully, he dipped a pen and looked expectantly at Kvothe.", "Kvothe sat forward in his chair and spoke quickly, \u201cI am. We are. She is. He was. They will be.\u201d Chronicler\u2019s pen danced and scratched down the page as Kvothe watched it. \u201cI, Chronicler do hereby avow that I can neither read nor write. Supine. Irreverent. Jackdaw.

The page in front of him held a single line of incomprehensible symbols. \u201cSome sort of cipher?\u201d Kvothe wondered aloud. \u201cVery neatly done, too.

Oh, nothing. I made it up. I wanted to see if an unfamiliar word would slow you down.\u201d He stretched, and pulled his chair closer to Chronicler\u2019s. \u201cAs soon as you show me how to read this, we can begin.\u201d", "Chronicler looked doubtful. \u201cIt\u2019s a very complex\u2014\u201d Seeing Kvothe frown, he sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d", "Chronicler drew a deep breath and began to write a line of symbols as he spoke. \u201cThere are around fifty different sounds we use to speak. I\u2019ve given each of them a symbol consisting of one or two pen strokes. It\u2019s all sound. I could conceivably transcribe a language I don\u2019t even understand.\u201d He pointed. \u201cThese are different vowel sounds.\u201d", "\u201cAll vertical lines,\u201d Kvothe said, looking intently at the page.", "Chronicler paused, thrown off his stride. \u201cWell ... yes.\u201d", "\u201cThe consonants would be horizontal then? And they would combine like this?\u201d Taking the pen, Kvothe made a few marks of his own on the page. \u201cClever. You\u2019d never need more than two or three for a word.\u201d", "Chronicler watched Kvothe quietly", "Kvothe didn\u2019t notice, his attention on the paper. \u201cIf this is \u2018am\u2019 then these must be the ah sounds,\u201d he motioned to a group of characters Chronicler had penned. \u201cAh, ay, aeh, auh. That would make these the ohs\u201d Kvothe nodded to himself and pressed the pen back into Chronicler\u2019s hand. \u201cShow me the consonants.\u201d", "Chronicler penned them down numbly, reciting the sounds as he wrote. After a moment, Kvothe took the pen and completed the list himself, asking the dumbfounded Chronicler to correct him if he made a mistake.", "Chronicler watched and listened as Kvothe completed the list. From beginning to end the whole process took about fifteen minutes. He made no mistakes.", "\u201cWonderfully efficient system,\u201d Kvothe said appreciatively. \u201cVery logical. Did you design it yourself?\u201d", "Chronicler took a long moment before he spoke, staring at the rows of characters on the page in front of Kvothe. Finally, disregarding Kvothe\u2019s question, Chronicler asked, \u201cDid you really learn Tenia in a day?\u201d", "Kvothe gave a faint smile and looked down at the table. \u201cThat\u2019s an old story I\u2019d almost forgotten. It took a day and a half, actually. A day and a half with no sleep. Why do you ask?\u201d", "\u201cI heard about it at the University.

A large portion to be sure, but I don\u2019t believe you can ever learn all of anything, let alone a language.\u201d", "Kvothe rubbed his hands together. \u201cNow, are you ready?\u201d", "Chronicler shook his head as if to clear it, set out a new sheet of paper, and nodded.", "Kvothe held up a hand to keep Chronicler from writing, and spoke, \u201cI\u2019ve never told this story before, and I doubt I\u2019ll ever tell it again.\u201d Kvothe leaned forward in his chair. \u201cBefore we begin, you must remember that I am of the Edema Ruh. We were telling stories before Caluptena burned. Before there were books to write in. Before there was music to play When the first fire kindled, we Ruh were there spinning stories in the circle of its flickering light.\u201d", "Kvothe nodded to the scribe. \u201cI know your reputation as a great collector of stories and recorder of events.\u201d Kvothe\u2019s eyes became hard as flint, sharp as broken glass. \u201cThat said, do not presume to change a word of what I say. If I seem to wander, if I seem to stray, remember that true stories seldom take the straightest way.\u201d", "Chronicler nodded solemnly, trying to imagine the mind that could break apart his cipher in a piece of an hour. A mind that could learn a language in a day", "Kvothe gave a gentle smile and looked around the room as if fixing it in his memory. Chronicler dipped his pen and Kvothe looked down at his folded hands for as long as it takes to draw three deep breaths.", "Then he began to speak.", "", "\u201cIn some ways, it began when I heard her singing.

Her voice was like a portrait of her soul: wild as a fire, sharp as shattered glass, sweet and clean as clover.\u201d", "Kvothe shook his head. \u201cNo. It began at the University. I went to learn magic of the sort they talk about in stories. Magic like Taborlin the Great. I wanted to learn the name of the wind. I wanted fire and lightning. I wanted answers to ten thousand questions and access to their archives.

I suppose that is where it all begins. This is, in many ways, a story about the Chandrian.\u201d", "Kvothe shook his head, as if to free himself from some dark thought. \u201cBut I suppose I must go even further back than that.

Very well, for simplicity\u2019s sake, let us assume I am the center of creation. In doing this, let us pass over innumerable boring stories: the rise and fall of empires, sagas of heroism, ballads of tragic love.

My troupe was not some poor batch of mummers, japing at crossroads for pennies, singing for our suppers. We were court performers, Lord Greyfallow\u2019s Men.

There were usually at least eight wagons in our troupe and well over two dozen performers: actors and acrobats, musicians and hand magicians, jugglers and jesters: My family.", "My father was a better actor and musician than any you have ever seen. My mother had a natural gift for words. They were both beautiful, with dark hair and easy laughter. They were Ruh down to their bones, and that, really, is all that needs to be said.", "Save perhaps that my mother was a noble before she was a trouper.

In truth, they seemed more content and faithful than many officially married couples I have seen since.", "Our patron was Baron Greyfallow, and his name opened many doors that would ordinarily be closed to the Edema Ruh. In return we wore his colors, green and grey, and added to his reputation wherever we went. Once a year we spent two span at his manor, entertaining him and his household.", "It was a happy childhood, growing up in the center of an endless fair. My father would read to me from the great monologues during the long wagon rides between towns. Reciting mostly from memory, his voice would roll down the road for a quarter mile. I remember reading along, coming in on the secondary parts. My father would encourage me to try particularly good sections myself, and I learned to love the feel of good words.", "My mother and I would make up songs together. Other times my parents would act out romantic dialogues while I followed along in the books. They seemed like games at the time. Little did I know how cunningly I was being taught.", "I was a curious child: quick with questions and eager to learn. With acrobats and actors as my teachers, it is little wonder that I never grew to dread lessons as most children do.", "The roads were safer in those days, but cautious folk would still travel with our troupe for safety\u2019s sake. They supplemented my education. I learned an eclectic smattering of Commonwealth law from a traveling barrister too drunk or too pompous to realize he was lecturing an eight-year-old. I learned woodcraft from a huntsman named Laclith who traveled with us for nearly a whole season.", "I learned the sordid inner workings of the royal court in Modeg from a ... courtesan.

But for us it was simply insulting. He should have offered us forty to play for the evening, free use of the public hall, a good meal, and beds at the inn. The last we would graciously decline, as their beds were no doubt lousy and those in our wagons were not.", "If my father was surprised or insulted, he did not show it. \u201cPack up!\u201d He shouted over one shoulder.", "Trip tucked his juggling stones into various pockets without so much as a flourish. There was a disappointed chorus from several dozen townsfolk as the puppets stopped midjape and were packed away.

The mayor nodded numbly \u201cCharming fellow, lovely singing voice. Met him when we were entertaining the baron last Midwinter.\u201d", "\u201cOf course,\u201d the mayor paused significantly \u201cMight I see your writ?\u201d", "I watched as the mayor read it. It took him a little while, as my father had not bothered to mention the majority of the baron\u2019s titles such as the Viscount of Montrone and Lord of Trelliston. The upshot was this: it was true that the Squire Semelan controlled this little town and all the land around it, but Semelan owed fealty directly to Greyfallow In more concrete terms, Greyfallow was captain of the ship; Semelan scrubbed the planking and saluted him.", "The mayor refolded the parchment and handed it back to my father. \u201cI see.\u201d", "That was all. I remember being stunned when the mayor didn\u2019t apologize or offer my father more money.", "My father paused as well, then continued, \u201cThe city is your jurisdiction, sir. But we\u2019ll perform either way.

We sometimes chose to play on the green because the local buildings weren\u2019t big enough. Two of our wagons were built to become stages for just that eventuality. But in my whole eleven years of memory I could barely count on both hands the times we\u2019d been forced to play the green. We had never played outside the city limits.", "But we were spared that. The mayor nodded at last and gestured my father closer. I slipped out the back of the wagon and moved close enough to catch the end of what he said, \u201c\u2014God-fearing folk around here. Nothing vulgar or heretical. We had a double handful of trouble with the last troupe that came through here, two fights, folks missing their laundry, and one of Branston\u2019s daughters got herself in a family way.\u201d", "I was outraged. I waited for my father to show the mayor the sharp side of his tongue, to explain the difference between mere traveling performers and Edema Ruh. We didn\u2019t steal. We would never let things get so out of control that a bunch of drunks ruined the hall where we were playing.", "But my father did nothing of the sort, he just nodded and walked back toward our wagon. He gestured and Trip started juggling again. The puppets reemerged from their cases.", "As he came around the wagon he saw me standing, half-hidden beside the horses. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you heard the whole thing from the look on your face,\u201d he said with a wry grin. \u201cLet it go, my boy. He gets full marks for honesty if not for grace. He just says out loud what other folk keep in the quiet of their hearts. Why do you think I have everyone stay in pairs when we go about our business in bigger towns?\u201d", "I knew it for the truth. Still, it was a hard pill for a young boy to swallow. \u201cTwenty pennies,\u201d I said scathingly. \u201cAs if he were offering us charity.\u201d", "That was the hardest part of growing up Edema Ruh. We are strangers everywhere. Many folk view us as vagabonds and beggars, while others deem us little more than thieves, heretics, and whores. It\u2019s hard to be wrongfully accused, but it\u2019s worse when the people looking down on you are clods who have never read a book or traveled more than twenty miles from the place they were born.", "My father laughed and roughed my hair. \u201cJust pity him, my boy. Tomorrow we\u2019ll be on our way, but he\u2019ll have to keep his own disagreeable company until the day he dies.\u201d", "\u201cHe\u2019s an ignorant blatherskate,\u201d I said bitterly.", "He lay a firm hand on my shoulder, letting me know I\u2019d said enough. \u201cThis is what comes of getting too close to Atur, I suppose. Tomorrow we\u2019ll head south: greener pastures, kinder folk, prettier women.\u201d He cupped an ear toward the wagon and nudged me with his elbow.", "\u201cI can hear everything you say,\u201d my mother called sweetly from inside. My father grinned and winked at me.", "\u201cSo what play are we going to do?\u201d I asked my father. \u201cNothing vulgar, mind you. They\u2019re God-fearing folk in these parts.\u201d", "He looked at me. \u201cWhat would you pick?\u201d", "I gave it a long moment\u2019s thought. \u201cI\u2019d play something from the Bright-field Cycle. The Forging of the Path or somesuch.\u201d", "My father made a face. \u201cNot a very good play.\u201d", "I shrugged. \u201cThey won\u2019t know the difference. Besides, it\u2019s chock full of Tehlu, so no one will complain about it being vulgar.\u201d I looked up at the sky. \u201cI just hope it doesn\u2019t rain on us halfway through.\u201d", "My father looked up at the clouds. \u201cIt will. Still, there are worse things than playing in the rain.\u201d", "\u201cLike playing in the rain and getting shimmed on the deal?\u201d I asked.", "The mayor hurried up to us, moving at a fast walk. There was a thin sheen of sweat on his forehead and he was puffing a little bit, as if he\u2019d been running. \u201cI talked it over with a few members of the council and we decided that it would be quite all right for you to use the public house if you would care to.\u201d", "My father\u2019s body language was perfect.

Though by the rosy glow in your lady\u2019s cheeks I should be charging you for a head and a half. Not that it\u2019s any of my business, mind you.\u201d", "Trip had the quickest tongue of anyone in the troupe, which made him the best man for the job of making sure no one tried to fast-talk or bully their way inside.

Yes, sir, empty head still pays full price.\u201d", "Though it was always fun to watch Trip work, most of my attention was on a wagon that had rolled into the other end of town about a quarter hour ago.

I don\u2019t need a license. Does a peddler need a license? Does a tinker need a license?\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re not a tinker,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cDon\u2019t try to pass yourself off as one.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not trying to pass myself off as anything,\u201d the old man snapped. \u201cI\u2019m a tinker and a peddler, and I\u2019m more than both. I\u2019m an arcanist, you great dithering heap of idiot.\u201d", "\u201cMy point exactly,\u201d the mayor said doggedly. \u201cWe\u2019re God-fearing people in these parts.

We don\u2019t want the trouble your kind can bring.\u201d", "\u201cMy kind?\u201d the old man said. \u201cWhat do you know about my kind? There probably hasn\u2019t been an arcanist through these parts in fifty years.\u201d", "\u201cWe like it that way Just turn around and go back the way you came.\u201d", "\u201cLike hell if I\u2019m spending a night in the rain because of your thick head,\u201d the old man said hotly. \u201cI don\u2019t need your permission to rent a room or do business in the street. Now get away from me or I\u2019ll show you firsthand what sort of trouble my kind can be.\u201d", "Fear flashed across the mayor\u2019s face before it was overwhelmed by outrage. He gestured over one shoulder at the constable. \u201cThen you\u2019ll spend the night in jail for vagrancy and threatening behavior. We\u2019ll let you on your way in the morning if you\u2019ve learned to keep a civil tongue in your head.\u201d The constable advanced on the wagon, his cudgel held cautiously at his side.", "The old man stood his ground and raised one hand. A deep, red light welled up from the front corners of his wagon. \u201cThat\u2019s far enough,\u201d he said ominously. \u201cThings could get ugly otherwise.\u201d", "After a moment\u2019s surprise, I realized the strange light came from a pair of sympathy lamps the old man had mounted on his wagon. I had seen one before, in Lord Greyfallow\u2019s library. They were brighter than gaslight, steadier than candles or lamps, and lasted nearly forever. They were also terribly expensive. I was willing to bet that no one in this little town had ever heard of them, let alone seen one.", "The constable stopped in his tracks when the light began to swell. But when nothing else seemed to happen, he set his jaw and kept walking toward the wagon.", "The old man\u2019s expression grew anxious. \u201cNow hold on a moment,\u201d he said as the red light from the wagon started to fade. \u201cWe don\u2019t want ...\u201d", "\u201cShut your clepper, you old shit-fire,\u201d the constable said. He snatched at the arcanist\u2019s arm as if he were sticking his hand into an oven. Then, when nothing happened, he smiled and grew more confident. \u201cDon\u2019t think I won\u2019t knock you a good one to keep you from working any more of your devilry.\u201d", "\u201cWell done, Tom,\u201d the mayor said, radiating relief. \u201cBring him along and we\u2019ll send someone back for the wagon.\u201d", "The constable grinned and twisted the old man\u2019s arm. The arcanist bent at the waist and gasped a short, painful breath.", "From where I hid, I saw the arcanist\u2019s face change from anxious, to pained, to angry all in a second. I saw his mouth move.", "A furious gust of wind came out of nowhere, as if a storm had suddenly burst with no warning. The wind struck the old man\u2019s wagon and it tipped onto two wheels before slamming back down onto four. The constable staggered and fell as if he had been struck by the hand of God. Even where I hid nearly thirty feet away the wind was so strong that I was forced to take a step forward, as if I\u2019d been pushed roughly from behind.", "\u201cBegone!\u201d the old man shouted angrily. \u201cTrouble me no longer! I will set fire to your blood and fill you with a fear like ice and iron!\u201dThere was something familiar about his words, but I couldn\u2019t put my finger on it.", "Both the mayor and the constable turned tail and ran, their eyes white and wild as startled horses\u2019.", "The wind faded as quickly as it had come. The whole sudden burst couldn\u2019t have lasted more than five seconds. As most of the townsfolk were gathered around the public house, I doubted anyone had seen it except for me, the mayor, the constable, and the old man\u2019s donkeys who stood placidly in their harness, utterly unperturbed.", "\u201cLeave this place clean of your foul presence,\u201d the arcanist muttered to himself as he watched them go. \u201cBy the power of my name I command it to be so.\u201d", "I finally realized why his words seemed so familiar. He was quoting lines from the exorcism scene in Daeonica. Not many folk knew that play.", "The old man turned back to his wagon and began to extemporize. \u201cI\u2019ll turn you into butter on a summer day. I\u2019ll turn you into a poet with the soul of a priest. I\u2019ll fill you with lemon custard and push you out a window.\u201d He spat. \u201cBastards.\u201d", "His irritation seemed to leave him and he heaved a great, weary sigh. \u201cWell that couldn\u2019t have gone much worse,\u201d the old man muttered as he rubbed at the shoulder of the arm the constable had twisted. \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll come back with a mob behind them?\u201d", "For a second I thought the old man was talking to me. Then I realized the truth. He was talking to his donkeys.", "\u201cI don\u2019t think so either,\u201d he said to them. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been wrong before. Let\u2019s stay near the edge of town and have a look at the last of the oats, shall we?\u201d", "He clambered up into the back of the wagon and came down with a wide bucket and a nearly empty burlap sack. He upended the sack into the bucket and seemed disheartened by the results. He took out a handful for himself before nudging the bucket toward the donkeys with his foot. \u201cDon\u2019t give me that look,\u201d he said to them. \u201cIt\u2019s short rations all around. Besides, you can graze.\u201d He petted one donkey while he ate his handful of rough oats, stopping occasionally to spit out a husk.", "It struck me as very sad, this old man all alone on the road with no one to talk to but his donkeys. It\u2019s hard for us Edema Ruh, but at least we had each other. This man had no one.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve wandered too far from civilization, boys. The folk that need me don\u2019t trust me, and the ones that trust me can\u2019t afford me.\u201d The old man peered into his purse. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a penny and a half, so our options are limited. Do we want to be wet tonight or hungry tomorrow? We\u2019re not going to do any business, so it will probably be one or the other.\u201d", "I slunk around the edge of the building until I could see what was written on the side of the old man\u2019s wagon.

Ale,\u201d I said, nodding. \u201cI get it.\u201d I brought my hand out of my pocket. \u201cCan you sell me anything for a penny?\u201d", "He seemed stuck between amusement and curiosity. \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019d like some lacillium.\u201d We had performed Farien the Fair a dozen times in the last month, and it had filled my young mind with intrigue and assassination.", "\u201cAre you expecting someone to poison you?\u201d he said, somewhat taken aback.", "\u201cNot really. But it seems to me that if you wait around until you know you need an antidote, it\u2019s probably too late to pick one up.\u201d", "\u201cI suppose I could sell you a penny\u2019s worth,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would be about a dose for a person your size. But it\u2019s dangerous stuff in its own right. It only cures certain poisons. You can hurt yourself if you take it at the wrong time.\u201d", "\u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d In the play it was touted as an infallible cure-all.", "Abenthy tapped his lips thoughtfully. \u201cCan you answer me a question in the meantime?\u201d I nodded. \u201cWhose troupe is that?\u201d", "\u201cIn a way it\u2019s mine,\u201d I said. \u201cBut in another way, it\u2019s my father\u2019s because he runs the show and points which way the wagons go. But it\u2019s Baron Grey-fallow\u2019s too, because he\u2019s our patron. We\u2019re Lord Greyfallow\u2019s Men.\u201d", "The old man gave me an amused look. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of you. Good troupe. Good reputation.\u201d", "I nodded, not seeing any point in false modesty.", "\u201cDo you think your father might be interested in taking on any help?\u201d he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t claim to be much of an actor, but I\u2019m handy to have around. I could make you face paint and rouge that aren\u2019t all full of lead and mercury and arsenic. I can do lights, too, quick, clean, and bright. Different colors if you want them.\u201d", "I didn\u2019t have to think too hard about it; candles were expensive and vulnerable to drafts, torches were dirty and dangerous. And everyone in the troupe learned the dangers of cosmetics at an early age. It was hard to become an old, seasoned trouper when you painted poison on yourself every third day and ended up raving mad by the time you were twenty-five.", "\u201cI may be overstepping myself a little,\u201d I said as I held out my hand for him to shake. \u201cBut let me be the first to welcome you to the troupe.\u201d", "", "If this is to be a full and honest account of my life and deeds, I feel I should mention that my reasons for inviting Ben into our troupe were not entirely altruistic. It\u2019s true that quality cosmetics and clean lights were a welcome addition to our troupe. It\u2019s also true that I\u2019d felt sorry for the old man alone on the road.", "But underneath it all I was moved by my curiosity. I had seen Abenthy do something I could not explain, something strange and wonderful. Not his trick with the sympathy lamps\u2014I recognized that for what it was: showmanship, a bluff to impress ignorant townsfolk.", "What he had done afterward was different. He called the wind and the wind came. It was magic. Real magic. The sort of magic I\u2019d heard about in stories of Taborlin the Great. The sort of magic I hadn\u2019t believed in since I was six. Now I didn\u2019t know what to believe.", "So I invited him into our troupe, hoping to find answers to my questions. Though I didn\u2019t know it at the time, I was looking for the name of the wind.", "", "", ""], "CHAPTER NINE": ["CHAPTER NINE", "Riding in the Wagon with Ben", "\nAbenthy was the first arcanist I ever met, a strange, exciting figure to a young boy. He was knowledgeable in all the sciences: botany, astronomy, psychology, anatomy, alchemy, geology, chemistry....", "He was portly, with twinkling eyes that moved quickly from one thing to another. He had a strip of dark grey hair running around the back of his head, but (and this is what I remember most about him) no eyebrows. Rather, he had them, but they were in a perpetual state of regrowing from being burned off in the course of his alchemical pursuits. It made him look surprised and quizzical all at once.", "He spoke gently, laughed often, and never exercised his wit at the expense of others. He cursed like a drunken sailor with a broken leg, but only at his donkeys. They were called Alpha and Beta, and Abenthy fed them carrots and lumps of sugar when he thought no one was looking. Chemistry was his particular love, and my father said he\u2019d never known a man to run a better still.", "By his second day in our troupe I was making a habit of riding in his wagon. I would ask him questions and he would answer. Then he would ask for songs and I would pluck them out for him on a lute I borrowed from my father\u2019s wagon.", "He would even sing from time to time. He had a bright, reckless tenor that was always wandering off, looking for notes in the wrong places. More often than not he stopped and laughed at himself when it happened. He was a good man, and there was no conceit in him.", "Not long after he joined our troupe, I asked Abenthy what it was like being an arcanist.", "He gave me a thoughtful look. \u201cHave you ever known an arcanist?\u201d", "\u201cWe paid one to mend a cracked axle on the road once.\u201d I paused to think. \u201cHe was heading inland with a caravan of fish.\u201d", "Abenthy made a dismissive gesture. \u201cNo, no, boy. I\u2019m talking about arcanists. Not some poor chill-charmer who works his way back and forth across caravan routes, trying to keep fresh meat from rotting.\u201d", "\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d I asked, sensing it was expected of me.", "\u201cWell,\u201d he said. \u201cThat might take a bit of explaining....\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve got nothing but time.\u201d", "Abenthy gave me an appraising look. I\u2019d been waiting for it. It was the look that said, \u201cYou don\u2019t sound as young as you look.\u201d I hoped he\u2019d come to grips with it fairly soon. It gets tiresome being spoken to as if you are a child, even if you happen to be one.", "He took a deep breath. \u201cJust because someone knows a trick or two doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re an arcanist. They might know how to set a bone or read Eld Vintic. Maybe they even know a little sympathy. But\u2014\u201d", "\u201cSympathy?\u201d I interrupted as politely as possible.", "\u201cYou\u2019d probably call it magic,\u201d Abenthy said reluctantly. \u201cIt\u2019s not, really.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cBut even knowing sympathy doesn\u2019t make you an arcanist. A true arcanist has worked his way through the Arcanum at the University.\u201d", "At his mention of the Arcanum, I bristled with two dozen new questions. Not so many, you might think, but when you added them to the half-hundred questions I carried with me wherever I went, I was stretched nearly to bursting. Only through a severe effort of will did I remain silent, waiting for Abenthy to continue on his own.", "Abenthy, however, noticed my reaction. \u201cSo, you\u2019ve heard about the Arcanum, have you?\u201d He seemed amused. \u201cTell me what you\u2019ve heard, then.\u201d", "This small prompt was all the excuse I needed. \u201cI heard from a boy in Temper Glen that if your arm\u2019s cut off they can sew it back on at the University. Can they really? Some stories say Taborlin the Great went there to learn the names of all things. There\u2019s a library with a thousand books. Are there really that many?\u201d", "He answered the last question, the others having rushed by too quickly for him to respond. \u201cMore than a thousand, actually. Ten times ten thousand books. More than that. More books than you could ever read.\u201d Abenthy\u2019s voice grew vaguely wistful.", "More books than I could read? Somehow I doubted that.", "Ben continued. \u201cThe people you see riding with caravans\u2014charmers who keep food from spoiling, dowsers, fortune-tellers, toad eaters\u2014aren\u2019t real arcanists any more than all traveling performers are Edema Ruh. They might know a little alchemy, a little sympathy, a little medicine.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cBut they\u2019re not arcanists.", "\u201cA lot of people pretend to be. They wear robes and put on airs to take advantage of the ignorant and gullible. But here\u2019s how you tell a true arcanist.\u201d", "Abenthy pulled a fine chain over his head and handed it to me. It was the first time I had ever seen an Arcanum guilder. It looked rather unimpressive, just a flat piece of lead with some unfamiliar writing stamped onto it.", "\u201cThat is a true gilthe. Or guilder if you prefer,\u201d Abenthy explained with some satisfaction. \u201cIt\u2019s the only sure way to be certain of who is and who isn\u2019t an arcanist. Your father asked to see mine before he let me ride with your troupe. It shows he\u2019s a man of the world.\u201d He watched me with a sly disinterest. \u201cUncomfortable, isn\u2019t it?\u201d", "I gritted my teeth and nodded. My hand had gone numb as soon as I\u2019d touched it. I was curious to study the markings on its front and back, but after the space of two breaths, my arm was numb to the shoulder, as if I had slept on it all night. I wondered if my whole body would go numb if I held it long enough.", "I was prevented from finding out, as the wagon hit a bump and my numbed hand almost let Abenthy\u2019s guilder fall to the footboard of the wagon. He snatched it up and slipped it back over his head, chuckling.", "\u201cHow can you stand it?\u201d I asked, trying to rub a little feeling back into my hand.", "\u201cIt only feels that way to other people,\u201d he explained. \u201cTo its owner, it\u2019s just warm. That\u2019s how you can tell the difference between an arcanist and someone who has a knack for finding water or guessing at the weather.\u201d", "\u201cTrip has something like that,\u201d I said. \u201cHe rolls sevens.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s a little different,\u201d Abenthy laughed. \u201cNot anything so unexplainable as a knack.\u201d He slouched a little farther down into his seat. \u201cProbably for the best. A couple hundred years ago, a person was good as dead if folk saw he had a knack. The Tehlins called them demon signs, and burned folk if they had them.\u201d Abenthy\u2019s mood seemed to have taken a downward turn.", "\u201cWe had to break Trip out of jail once or twice,\u201d I said, trying to lighten the tone of the conversation. \u201cBut no one actually tried to burn him.\u201d", "Abenthy gave a tired smile. \u201cI suspect Trip has a pair of clever dice or an equally clever skill which probably extends to cards as well. I thank you for your timely warning, but a knack is something else entirely.\u201d", "I can\u2019t abide being patronized. \u201cTrip can\u2019t cheat to save his life,\u201d I said a little more sharply than I had intended. \u201cAnd anyone in the troupe can tell good dice from bad. Trip throws sevens. It doesn\u2019t matter whose dice he uses, he rolls sevens. If he bets on someone, they roll sevens. If he so much as bumps a table with loose dice on it, seven.\u201d", "\u201cHmmm.\u201d Abenthy nodded to himself. \u201cMy apologies. That does sound like a knack. I\u2019d be curious to see it.\u201d", "I nodded. \u201cTake your own dice. We haven\u2019t let him play for years.\u201d A thought occurred to me. \u201cIt might not still work.\u201d", "He shrugged. \u201cKnacks don\u2019t go away so easily as that. When I was growing up in Staup, I knew a young man with a knack. Uncommonly good with plants.\u201d Abenthy\u2019s grin was gone as he looked off at something I couldn\u2019t see. \u201cHis tomatoes would be red while everyone else\u2019s vines were still climbing. His squash were bigger and sweeter, his grapes didn\u2019t hardly have to be bottled before they started being wine.\u201d He trailed off, his eyes far away.", "\u201cDid they burn him?\u201d I asked with the morbid curiosity of the young.", "\u201cWhat? No, of course not. I\u2019m not that old.\u201d He scowled at me in mock severity. \u201cThere was a drought and he got run out of town. His poor mother was heartbroken.\u201d", "There was a moment of silence. Two wagons ahead of us, I heard Teren and Shandi rehearsing lines from The Swineherd and the Nightingale.", "Abenthy seemed to be listening as well, in an offhand way. After Teren got himself lost halfway through Fains garden monologue, I turned back to face him. \u201cDo they teach acting at the University?\u201d I asked.", "Abenthy shook his head, slightly amused by the question. \u201cMany things, but not that.\u201d", "I looked over at Abenthy and saw him watching me, his eyes danced.", "\u201cCould you teach me some of those other things?\u201d I asked.", "He smiled, and it was as easy as that.", "", "Abenthy proceeded to give me a brief overview of each of the sciences. While his main love was for chemistry, he believed in a rounded education. I learned how to work the sextant, the compass, the slipstick, the abacus.

At least as disappointed as I could be in the Heart of Stone. I lifted the coin in my hand, and the coin on the table lifted itself in a similar fashion. It was magic, there was no doubt about that.

I think he was surprised that I figured it out without being told.", "Let me sum up sympathy very quickly since you will probably never need to have anything other than a rough comprehension of how these things work.", "First, energy cannot be created or destroyed. When you are lifting one drab and the other rises off the table, the one in your hand feels as heavy as if you\u2019re lifting both, because, in fact, you are.", "That\u2019s in theory. In practice, it feels like you\u2019re lifting three drabs. No sympathetic link is perfect. The more dissimilar the items, the more energy is lost. Think of it as a leaky aqueduct leading to a water wheel. A good sympathetic link has very few leaks, and most of the energy is used. A bad link is full of holes; very little of the effort you put into it goes toward what you want it to do.", "For instance I tried linking a piece of chalk to a glass bottle of water. There was very little similarity between the two, so even though the bottle of water might have weighed two pounds, when I tried to lift the chalk it felt like sixty pounds. The best link I found was a tree branch I had broken in half.", "After I understood this little piece of sympathy, Ben taught me others. A dozen dozen sympathetic bindings. A hundred little tricks for channeling power. Each of them was a different word in a vast vocabulary I was just beginning to speak. Quite often it was tedious, and I\u2019m not telling you the half of it.", "Ben continued giving me a smattering of lessons in other areas: history, arithmetic, and chemistry. But I grabbed at whatever he could teach me about sympathy He doled out his secrets sparingly, making me prove I\u2019d mastered one before giving me another.

Yllish?\u201d", "\u201cSounds like Tenia,\u201d my mother said.", "\u201cYou\u2019ve got a good ear,\u201d Ben said to her. \u201cIt\u2019s Temic, actually. Predates Tenia by about a thousand years.\u201d", "\u201cWell that simplifies things,\u201d I heard my father say. \u201cI wish I\u2019d asked you a month ago. I don\u2019t suppose you know why they do what they do?\u201d I could tell by my father\u2019s tone that he didn\u2019t really expect an answer.", "\u201cThat\u2019s the real mystery, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ben chuckled. \u201cI think that\u2019s what makes them more frightening than the rest of the bogey-men you hear about in stories. A ghost wants revenge, a demon wants your soul, a shamble-man is hungry and cold. It makes them less terrible. Things we understand we can try to control. But Chandrian come like lightning from a clear blue sky. Just destruction. No rhyme or reason to it.\u201d", "\u201cMy song will have both,\u201d my father said with grim determination. \u201cI think I\u2019ve dug up their reason, after all this while. I\u2019ve teased it together from bits and pieces of story. That\u2019s what\u2019s so galling about this, to have the harder part of this done and have all these small specifics giving me such trouble.\u201d", "\u201cYou think you know?\u201d Ben said curiously. \u201cWhat\u2019s your theory?\u201d", "My father gave a low chuckle. \u201cOh no Ben, you\u2019ll have to wait with the others. I\u2019ve sweated too long over this song to give away the heart of it before it\u2019s finished.\u201d", "I could hear the disappointment in Ben\u2019s voice. \u201cI\u2019m sure this is all just an elaborate ruse to keep me traveling with you,\u201d he groused. \u201cI won\u2019t be able to leave until I\u2019ve heard the blackened thing.\u201d", "\u201cThen help us finish it,\u201d my mother said. \u201cThe Chandrian\u2019s signs are another key piece of information we can\u2019t nail down. Everyone agrees there are signs that warn of their presence, but nobody agrees on what they are.\u201d", "\u201cLet me think ...\u201d Ben said. \u201cBlue flame is obvious, of course. But I\u2019d hesitate to attribute that to the Chandrian in particular. In some stories it\u2019s a sign of demons. In others it\u2019s fae creatures, or magic of any sort.\u201d", "\u201cIt shows bad air in mines, too,\u201d my mother pointed out.", "\u201cDoes it?\u201d my father asked.", "She nodded. \u201cWhen a lamp burns with a blue haze you know there\u2019s firedamp in the air.\u201d", "\u201cGood lord, firedamp in a coal mine,\u201d my father said. \u201cBlow out your light and get lost in the black, or leave it burn and blow the whole place to flinders. That\u2019s more frightening than any demon.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll also admit to the fact that certain arcanists occasionally use prepared candles or torches to impress gullible townsfolk,\u201d Ben said, clearing his throat self-consciously.", "My mother laughed. \u201cRemember who you\u2019re talking to, Ben. We\u2019d never hold a little showmanship against a man. In fact, blue candles would be just the thing the next time we play Daeonica. If you happened to find a couple tucked away somewhere, that is.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do,\u201d Ben said, his voice amused. \u201cOther signs ... one of them is supposed to have eyes like a goat, or no eyes, or black eyes. I\u2019ve heard that one quite a bit. I\u2019ve heard that plants die when the Chandrian are around. Wood rots, metal rusts, brick crumbles....\u201d He paused. \u201cThough I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s several signs, or all one sign.\u201d", "\u201cYou begin to see the trouble I\u2019m having,\u201d my father said morosely. \u201cAnd there\u2019s still the question as to if they all share the same signs, or have a couple each.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve told you,\u201d my mother said, exasperated. \u201cOne sign for each of them. It makes the most sense.\u201d", "\u201cMy lady wife\u2019s favorite theory,\u201d my father said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t fit. In some stories the only sign is blue flame. In others you have animals going crazy and no blue flame. In others you have a man with black eyes and animals going mad and blue flame.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve told you how to make sense of that,\u201d she said, her irritated tone indicating they\u2019d had this particular discussion before. \u201cThey don\u2019t always have to be together. They could go out in threes or fours. If one of them makes fires dim, then it\u2019ll look the same as if they all made the fires dim. That would account for the differences in the stories. Different numbers and different signs depending on how they\u2019re grouped together.\u201d", "My father grumbled something.", "\u201cThat\u2019s a clever wife you\u2019ve got there, Arl.\u201d Ben spoke up, breaking the tension. \u201cHow much will you sell her for?\u201d", "\u201cI need her for my work, unfortunately. But if you\u2019re interested in a short-term rental, I\u2019m sure we could arrange a reas\u2014\u201dThere was a fleshy thump followed by a slightly pained chortle in my father\u2019s baritone. \u201cAny other signs that spring to mind?\u201d", "\u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be cold to the touch. Though how anyone could know that is beyond me. I\u2019ve heard that fires don\u2019t burn around them. Though that directly contradicts the blue flame. It could\u2014\u201d", "The wind picked up, stirring the trees. The rustling leaves drowned out what Ben said. I took advantage of the noise to creep a few steps closer.", "\u201c... being \u2018yoked to shadow,\u2019 whatever that means,\u201d I heard my father say as the wind died down.", "Ben grunted. \u201cI couldn\u2019t say either. I heard a story where they were given away because their shadows pointed the wrong way, toward the light. And there was another where one of them was referred to as \u2018shadow-hamed.\u2019 It was \u2018something the shadow-hamed.\u2019 Damned if I can remember the name though....\u201d", "\u201cSpeaking of names, that\u2019s another point I\u2019m having trouble with,\u201d my father said. \u201cThere are a couple dozen I\u2019ve collected that I\u2019d appreciate your opinion on. The most\u2014\u201d", "\u201cActually, Arl,\u201d Ben interrupted, \u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you didn\u2019t say them out loud. Names of people, that is. You can scratch them in the dirt if you\u2019d like, or I could go fetch a slate, but I\u2019d be more comfortable if you didn\u2019t actually say any of them. Better safe than sore, as they say.\u201d", "There was a deep piece of silence. I stopped midsneak with one foot off the ground, afraid they\u2019d heard me.", "\u201cNow don\u2019t go looking at me like that, either of you,\u201d Ben said testily.", "\u201cWe\u2019re just surprised, Ben,\u201d came my mother\u2019s gentle voice. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem the superstitious type.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Ben said. \u201cI\u2019m careful. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d", "\u201cOf course,\u201d my father said. \u201cI\u2019d never\u2014\u201d", "\u201cSave it for the paying customers, Arl,\u201d Ben cut him off, irritation plain in his voice. \u201cYou\u2019re too good an actor to show it, but I know perfectly well when someone thinks I\u2019m daft.\u201d", "\u201cI just didn\u2019t expect it, Ben,\u201d my father said apologetically. \u201cYou\u2019re educated, and I\u2019m so tired of people touching iron and tipping their beer as soon as I mention the Chandrian. I\u2019m just reconstructing a story, not meddling with dark arts.\u201d", "\u201cWell, hear me out. I like both of you too well to let you think of me as an old fool,\u201d Ben said. \u201cBesides, I have something to talk with you about later, and I\u2019ll need you to take me seriously for that.\u201d", "The wind continued to pick up, and I used the noise to cover my last few steps. I edged around the corner of my parents\u2019 wagon and peered through a veil of leaves. The three of them were sitting around the campfire. Ben was sitting on a stump, huddled in his frayed brown cloak. My parents were opposite him, my mother leaning against my father, a blanket draped loosely around them.", "Ben poured from a clay jug into a leather mug and handed it to my mother. His breath fogged as he spoke. \u201cHow do they feel about demons off in Atur?\u201d he asked.", "\u201cScared.\u201d My father tapped his temple. \u201cAll that religion makes their brains soft.\u201d", "\u201cHow about off in Vintas?\u201d Ben asked. \u201cFair number of them are Tehlins. Do they feel the same way?\u201d", "My mother shook her head. \u201cThey think it\u2019s a little silly They like their demons metaphorical.\u201d", "\u201cWhat are they afraid of at night in Vintas then?\u201d", "\u201cThe Fae,\u201d my mother said.", "My father spoke at the same time. \u201cDraugar.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re both right, depending on which part of the country you\u2019re in,\u201d Ben said. \u201cAnd here in the Commonwealth people laugh up their sleeves at both ideas.\u201d He gestured at the surrounding trees. \u201cBut here they\u2019re careful come autumn-time for fear of drawing the attention of shamble-men.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s the way of things,\u201d my father said. \u201cHalf of being a good trouper is knowing which way your audience leans.\u201d", "\u201cYou still think I\u2019ve gone cracked in the head,\u201d Ben said, amused. \u201cListen, if tomorrow we pulled into Biren and someone told you there were shamble-men in the woods, would you believe them?\u201d My father shook his head. \u201cWhat if two people told you?\u201d Another shake.", "Ben leaned forward on his stump. \u201cWhat if a dozen people told you, with perfect earnestness, that shamble-men were out in the fields, eating\u2014\u201d", "\u201cOf course I wouldn\u2019t believe them,\u201d my father said, irritated. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d", "\u201cOf course it is,\u201d Ben agreed, raising a finger. \u201cBut the real question is this: Would you go into the woods?\u201d", "My father sat very still and thoughtful for a moment.", "Ben nodded. \u201cYou\u2019d be a fool to ignore half the town\u2019s warning, even though you don\u2019t believe the same thing they do.

Every place has its little superstitions, and everyone laughs at what the folk across the river think.\u201d He gave them a serious look. \u201cBut have either of you ever heard a humorous song or story about the Chandrian? I\u2019ll bet a penny you haven\u2019t.\u201d", "My mother shook her head after a moment\u2019s thought. My father took a long drink before joining her.", "\u201cNow I\u2019m not saying that the Chandrian are out there, striking like lightning from the clear blue sky. But folk everywhere are afraid of them. There\u2019s usually a reason for that.\u201d", "Ben grinned and tipped his clay cup, pouring the last drizzle of beer out onto the earth. \u201cAnd names are strange things. Dangerous things.\u201d He gave them a pointed look. \u201cThat I know for true because I am an educated man. If I\u2019m a mite superstitious too ...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWell, that\u2019s my choice. I\u2019m old. You have to humor me.\u201d", "My father nodded thoughtfully. \u201cIt\u2019s odd I never noticed that everyone treats the Chandrian the same. It\u2019s something I should\u2019ve seen.\u201d He shook his head as if to clear it. \u201cWe can come back to names later, I suppose. What was it you wanted to talk about?\u201d", "I prepared to sneak off before I was caught, but what Ben said next froze me in place before I took a single step.", "\u201cIt\u2019s probably hard to see, being his parents and all. But your young Kvothe is rather bright.\u201d Ben refilled his cup, and held out the jug to my father, who declined it. \u201cAs a matter of fact,\u2019bright\u2019 doesn\u2019t begin to cover it, not by half.\u201d", "My mother watched Ben over the top of her mug. \u201cAnyone who spends a little time with the boy can see that, Ben.

Least of all, you.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t think you really grasp the situation,\u201d Ben said, stretching his feet almost into the fire. \u201cHow easily did he pick up the lute?\u201d", "My father seemed a little surprised by the sudden change of topic. \u201cFairly easily, why?\u201d", "\u201cHow old was he?\u201d", "My father tugged thoughtfully at his beard for a moment. In the silence my mother\u2019s voice was like a flute. \u201cEight.\u201d", "\u201cThink back to when you learned to play. Can you remember how old you were? Can you remember the sort of difficulties you had?\u201d My father continued to tug on his beard, but his face was more reflective now, his eyes far away.", "Abenthy continued. \u201cI\u2019ll bet he learned each chord, each fingering after being shown just once, no stumbling, no complaining. And when he did make a mistake it was never more than once, right?\u201d", "My father seemed a little perturbed. \u201cMostly, but he did have trouble, just the same as anyone else. E chord. He had a lot of trouble with greater and diminished E.\u201d", "My mother broke in softly. \u201cI remember too, dear, but I think it was just his small hands. He was awfully young....\u201d", "\u201cI bet it didn\u2019t stall him for long,\u201d Ben said quietly. \u201cHe does have marvelous hands; my mother would have called them magician\u2019s fingers.\u201d", "My father smiled. \u201cHe gets them from his mother, delicate, but strong. Perfect for scrubbing pots, eh woman?\u201d", "My mother swatted him, then caught one of his hands in her own and unfolded it for Ben to see. \u201cHe gets them from his father, graceful and gentle. Perfect for seducing young nobles\u2019 daughters.\u201d My father started to protest, but she ignored him. \u201cWith his eyes and those hands there won\u2019t be a woman safe in all the world when he starts hunting after the ladies.\u201d", "\u201cCourting, dear,\u201d my father corrected gently.", "\u201cSemantics,\u201d she shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s all a chase, and when the race is done, I think I pity women chaste who run.\u201d She leaned back against my father, keeping his hand in her lap. She tilted her head slightly and he took his cue, leaning in to kiss the corner of her mouth.", "\u201cAmen,\u201d Ben said, raising his mug in salute.", "My father put his other arm around her and gave her a squeeze. \u201cI still don\u2019t see what you\u2019re getting at, Ben.\u201d", "\u201cHe does everything that way, quick as a whip, hardly ever makes mistakes. I\u2019ll bet he knows every song you\u2019ve ever sung to him. He knows more about what\u2019s in my wagon than I do.\u201d", "He picked up the jug and uncorked it. \u201cIt\u2019s not just memorization though. He understands. Half the things I\u2019ve been meaning to show him he\u2019s already figured out for himself.\u201d", "Ben refilled my mother\u2019s cup. \u201cHe\u2019s eleven.

A great deal of it comes from living in such an enlightened atmosphere.\u201d Ben gestured to the wagons. \u201cBut most eleven-year-olds\u2019 deepest thoughts have to do with skipping stones, and how to swing a cat by the tail.\u201d", "My mother laughed like bells, but Abenthy\u2019s face was serious. \u201cIt\u2019s true, lady. I\u2019ve had older students that would have loved to do half as well.\u201d He grinned. \u201cIf I had his hands, and one quarter his wit, I\u2019d be eating off silver plates inside a year.\u201d", "There was a lull. My mother spoke softly, \u201cI remember when he was just a little baby, toddling around. Watching, always watching. With clear bright eyes that looked like they wanted to swallow up the world.\u201d Her voice had a little quaver in it. My father put his arm around her and she rested her head on his chest.", "The next silence was longer. I was considering sneaking away when my father broke it. \u201cWhat is it you suggest we do?\u201d His voice was a mix of mild concern and fatherly pride.", "Ben smiled gently. \u201cNothing except to think about what options you might give him when the time comes. He will leave his mark on the world as one of the best.\u201d", "\u201cThe best what?\u201d my father rumbled.", "\u201cWhatever he chooses.

The only truly famous Edema Ruh in all of history All our oldest, best songs are his songs.", "What\u2019s more, if you believed the stories, Illien reinvented the lute in his lifetime. A master luthier, Illien transformed the archaic, fragile, unwieldy court lute into the marvelous, versatile, seven-string trouper\u2019s lute we use today. The same stories claim Illien\u2019s own lute had eight strings in all.", "\u201cIllien. I like that thought,\u201d my mother said. \u201cKings coming from miles away to hear my little Kvothe play\u201d", "\u201cHis music stopping barroom brawls and border wars.\u201d Ben smiled.", "\u201cThe wild women in his lap,\u201d my father enthused, \u201claying their breasts on his head.\u201d", "There was a moment of stunned silence.

Seventeen is about as young as they go, but I have no doubts about ...\u201d", "I missed the rest of what Ben said. The University!

That might solve our little mystery.\u201d", "She swatted at him playfully, and a thoughtful look crossed her face. \u201cCome to think of it, there was a night, about a dozen years ago, a man came to me. He bound me with kisses and cords of chorded song. He robbed me of my virtue and stole me away.\u201d She paused, \u201cBut he didn\u2019t have red hair.

Bast stepped into the room, muttering under his breath.", "He was dressed simply: black long-sleeved shirt tucked into black pants; black pants tucked into soft black boots. His face was sharp and delicate, almost beautiful, with striking blue eyes.", "He carried a jug to the bar, walking with a strange and not unpleasant grace. \u201cOne customer?\u201d he said reproachfully. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t get it yourself?

As the conversation continued, Chronicler\u2019s expression had grown by degrees more puzzled and more intent.", "In fairness, something ought to be said about Bast. At first glance, he looked to be an average, if attractive, young man. But there was something different about him. For instance, he wore soft black leather boots. At least, if you looked at him that\u2019s what you saw. But if you happened to catch a glimpse of him from the corner of your eye, and if he were standing in the right type of shadow, you might see something else entirely.", "And if you had the right sort of mind, the sort of mind that actually sees what it looks at, you might notice that his eyes were odd. If your mind had the rare talent of not being fooled by its own expectations, you might notice something else about them, something strange and wonderful.", "Because of this, Chronicler had been staring at Kvothe\u2019s young student, trying to decide what was different about him. By the time their conversation was through, Chronicler\u2019s gaze would be considered intense at the very least, and rude by most. When Bast finally turned from the bar, Chronicler\u2019s eyes widened perceptibly, and the color drained from his already pale face.", "Chronicler reached inside his shirt and tugged something from around his neck. He set it on the table at arm\u2019s length, between himself and Bast. All this was done in half a second, and his eyes never left the dark-haired young man at the bar. Chronicler\u2019s face was calm as he pressed the metal disk firmly onto the table with two fingers.", "\u201cIron,\u201d he said. His voice sounding with strange resonance, as if it were an order to be obeyed.", "Bast doubled over as if punched in the stomach, baring his teeth and making a noise halfway between a growl and a scream. Moving with an unnatural, sinuous speed, he drew one hand back to the side of his head and tensed himself to spring.", "It all happened in the time it takes to draw a sharp breath. Still, somehow, Kvothe\u2019s long-fingered hand caught Bast\u2019s wrist. Unaware or uncaring, Bast leaped toward Chronicler only to be brought up short, as if Kvothe\u2019s hand were a shackle. Bast struggled furiously to free himself, but Kvothe stood behind the bar, arm outstretched, motionless as steel or stone.", "\u201cStop!\u201d Kvothe\u2019s voice struck the air like a commandment, and in the stillness that followed, his words were sharp and angry. \u201cI will have no fighting among my friends. I have lost enough without that.\u201d His eyes caught Chronicler. \u201cUndo that, or I will break it.\u201d", "Chronicler paused, shaken. Then his mouth moved silently, and with a slight tremor he drew his hand away from the circle of dull metal that lay upon the table.", "Tension poured out of Bast, and for a moment he hung limply as a rag doll from the wrist Kvothe still held, standing behind the bar. Shakily, Bast managed to find his feet and lean against the bar. Kvothe gave him a long, searching look, then released his wrist.", "Bast slumped onto the stool without taking his eyes from Chronicler. He moved gingerly, like a man with a tender wound.", "And he had changed. The eyes that watched Chronicler were still a striking ocean blue, but now they showed themselves to be all one color, like gems or deep forest pools, and his soft leather boots had been replaced with graceful cloven hooves.", "Kvothe motioned Chronicler forward imperiously, then turned to grab two thick glasses and a bottle seemingly at random. He set the glasses down as Bast and Chronicler eyed each other uneasily.", "\u201cNow,\u201d Kvothe said angrily, \u201cyou\u2019ve both acted understandably, but that does not by any means mean that either of you has behaved well. So, we might as well start over altogether.\u201d", "He drew a deep breath. \u201cBast, let me introduce you to Devan Lochees, also known as Chronicler. By all accounts a great teller, rememberer, and recorder of stories. In addition, unless I have suddenly lost all my wit, an accomplished member of the Arcanum, at least Re\u2019lar, and one of perhaps two score people in the world who knows the name of iron.", "\u201cHowever,\u201d Kvothe continued, \u201cin spite of these accolades he seems to be a bit innocent of the ways of the world. As demonstrated by his plentiful lack of wit in making a near-suicidal attack on what I guess is the first of the folk he has ever had the luck to see.\u201d", "Chronicler stood impassively throughout the introduction, watching Bast as if he were a snake.", "\u201cChronicler, I would like you to meet Bastas, son of Remmen, Prince of Twilight and the Telwyth Mael. The brightest, which is to say the only student I\u2019ve had the misfortune to teach. Glamourer, bartender, and, not last, my friend.", "\u201cWho, over the course of a hundred and fifty years of life, not to mention nearly two years of my personal tutelage, has managed to avoid learning a few important facts. The first being this: attacking a member of the Arcanum skilled enough to make a binding of iron is foolish.\u201d", "\u201cHe attacked me!\u201d said Bast hotly.", "Kvothe looked at him coolly. \u201cI didn\u2019t say it was unjustified. I said it was foolish.\u201d", "\u201cI would have won.\u201d", "\u201cVery likely. But you would have been hurt, and he would be hurt or dead. Do you remember that I had introduced him as my guest?\u201d", "Bast was silent. His expression remained belligerent.", "\u201cNow,\u201d said Kvothe with a brittle cheerfulness. \u201cYou\u2019ve been introduced.\u201d", "\u201cPleased,\u201d Bast said icily.", "\u201cLikewise,\u201d Chronicler returned.", "\u201cThere is no reason for you two to be anything other than friends,\u201d Kvothe continued, an edge creeping into his voice. \u201cAnd that is not how friends greet each other.\u201d", "Bast and Chronicler stared at each other, neither moved.", "Kvothe\u2019s voice grew quiet, \u201cIf you do not stop this foolishness, you may both leave now. One of you will be left with a slim sliver of story, and the other can search out a new teacher. If there is one thing I will not abide, it is the folly of a willful pride.\u201d", "Something about the low intensity of Kvothe\u2019s voice broke the stare between them. And when they turned to look at him it seemed that someone very different was standing behind the bar. The jovial innkeeper was gone, and in his place stood someone dark and fierce.", "He\u2019s so young, Chronicler marveled. He can\u2019t be more than twenty-five. Why didn\u2019t I see it before? He could break me in his hands like a kindling stick. How did I ever mistake him for an innkeeper, even for a moment?", "Then he saw Kvothe\u2019s eyes. They had deepened to a green so dark they were nearly black. This is who I came to see, Chronicler thought to himself, this is the man who counseled kings and walked old roads with nothing but his wit to guide him. This is the man whose name has become both praise and curse at the University.", "Kvothe stared at Chronicler and Bast in turn; neither could meet his eye for very long. After an awkward pause, Bast extended his hand. Chronicler hesitated for a bare moment before reaching out quickly, as if he were sticking his hand into a fire.", "Nothing happened, both of them seemed moderately surprised.", "\u201cAmazing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Kvothe addressed them bitingly \u201cFive fingers and flesh with blood beneath. One could almost believe that on the other end of that hand lay a person of some sort.\u201d", "Guilt crept into the expressions of the two men. They let go of each other\u2019s hands.", "Kvothe poured something from the green bottle into the glasses. This simple gesture changed him. He seemed to fade back into himself, until there was little left of the dark-eyed man who\u2019d stood behind the bar a moment ago. Chronicler felt a pang of loss as he stared at the innkeeper with one hand hidden in a linen rag.", "\u201cNow.\u201d Kvothe pushed the glasses toward them. \u201cTake these drinks, sit at that table, and talk. When I come back, I don\u2019t want to find either one of you dead or the building on fire. Fair?\u201d", "Bast gave an embarrassed smile as Chronicler picked up the glasses and moved back to the table. Bast followed him and almost sat down before returning to grab the bottle too.", "\u201cNot too much of that,\u201d Kvothe cautioned as he stepped into the back room. \u201cI don\u2019t want you giggling through my story.\u201d", "The two at the table began a tense, halting conversation as Kvothe moved into the kitchen. Several minutes later he emerged, bringing out cheese and a loaf of dark bread, cold chicken and sausage, butter and honey.", "They moved to a larger table as Kvothe brought the platters out, bustling about and looking every bit the innkeeper. Chronicler watched him covertly, finding it hard to believe that this man humming to himself and cutting sausage could be the same person who had stood behind the bar just minutes ago, dark-eyed and terrible.", "As Chronicler gathered his paper and quills, Kvothe studied the angle of the sun through the window, a pensive look on his face. Eventually he turned to Bast. \u201cHow much did you manage to overhear?\u201d", "\u201cMost of it, Reshi,\u201d Bast smiled. \u201cI have good ears.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s good. We don\u2019t have time to backtrack.\u201d He drew a deep breath. \u201cLet\u2019s get back to it then. Brace yourselves, the story takes a turn now. Downward. Darker.

But honestly, I was disappointed. It was not what I expected magic to be.", "It was useful. There was no denying that. Ben used sympathy to make light for our shows. Sympathy could start a fire without flint or lift a heavy weight without cumbersome ropes and pulleys.", "But the first time I\u2019d seen him, Ben had somehow called the wind. That was no mere sympathy. That was storybook magic. That was the secret I wanted more than anything.", "", "Spring thaw was well behind us and the troupe was riding through the forests and fields of the western Commonwealth.

Ben was drowsing with the reins held loosely in one hand when the wagon hit a stone and jarred us both out of our respective reveries.", "Ben pulled himself more upright in his seat, and addressed me in a tone I had grown to think of as Have-I-Got-a-Puzzle-for-You. \u201cHow would you bring a kettle of water to a boil?\u201d", "Looking around I saw a large boulder by the side of the road. I pointed.", "\u201cThat stone should be warm from sitting in the sun.

At the same time I was struck with an idea.", "I drew in a deep breath and spoke the words to bind the air in my lungs to the air outside. I fixed the Alar firmly in my mind, put my thumb and forefinger in front of my pursed lips, and blew between them.", "There was a light puff of wind at my back that tousled my hair and caused the tarpaulin covering the wagon to pull taut for a moment. It might have been nothing more than a coincidence, but nevertheless, I felt an exultant smile overflow my face. For a second I did nothing but grin like a maniac at Ben, his face dull with disbelief.", "Then I felt something squeeze my chest, as if I was deep underwater.", "I tried to draw a breath but couldn\u2019t. Mildly confused, I kept trying. It felt as if I\u2019d just fallen flat on my back and had the air driven from me.", "All in a rush I realized what I had done. My body exploded into a cold sweat and I grabbed frantically at Ben\u2019s shirt, pointing at my chest, my neck, my open mouth.", "Ben\u2019s face turned from shocked to ashen as he looked at me.", "I realized how still everything was. Not a blade of grass was stirring. Even the sound of the wagon seemed muted, as if far off in the distance.", "Terror screamed through my mind, drowning out any thought. I began to claw at my throat, ripping my shirt open. My heart thundered through the ringing in my ears. Pain stabbed through my straining chest as I gaped for air.", "Moving more quickly than I had ever seen before, Ben grabbed me by the tatters of my shirt and sprang from the seat of the wagon. Landing in the grass by the side of the road, he dashed me to the ground with such a force that, if I\u2019d had any air in my lungs, it would have been driven out of me.", "Tears streaked my face as I thrashed blindly. I knew that I was going to die. My eyes felt hot and red. I raked madly at the earth with hands that were numb and cold as ice.", "I was aware of someone shouting, but it seemed very far away. Ben kneeled above me, but the sky was getting dim behind him. He seemed almost distracted, as if he were listening to something I couldn\u2019t hear.", "Then he looked at me, all I remember were his eyes, they seemed far away and filled with a terrible power, dispassionate and cold.", "He looked at me. His mouth moved. He called the wind.", "A leaf in lightning, I shook. And the thunderclap was black.", "", "The next thing I remember was Ben helping me to my feet. I was dimly aware of the other wagons stopping and curious faces peering at us. My mother came away from our wagon and Ben met her halfway, chuckling and saying something reassuring. I couldn\u2019t make out the words as I was focused on breathing deep, in and out.", "The other wagons trundled on, and I followed Ben mutely back to his wagon. He made a show of puttering around, checking the cords that held the tarpaulin tight. I collected my wits and was helping as best I could when the final wagon in the troupe passed us.", "When I looked up, Ben\u2019s eyes were furious. \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d he hissed. \u201cWell? What? What were you thinking?\u201d I\u2019d never seen him like this before, his whole body drawn up into a tight knot of anger. He was shaking with it.

Not knowing what else to do, I followed him.", "Ben twitched the reins and Alpha and Beta tugged the wagon into motion. We were last in line now. Ben stared straight ahead. I fingered the torn front of my shirt. It was tensely silent.", "In hindsight, what I had done was glaringly stupid. When I bound my breath to the air outside, it made it impossible for me to breathe. My lungs weren\u2019t strong enough to move that much air. I would have needed a chest like an iron bellows. I would have had as much luck trying to drink a river or lift a mountain.", "We rode for about two hours in an uncomfortable silence. The sun was brushing the tops of the trees when Ben finally drew in a deep breath and let it out in an explosive sigh. He handed me the reins.", "When I looked back at him I realized for the first time how old he was. I had always known he was nearing his third score of years, but I\u2019d never seen him look it before.", "\u201cI lied to your mother back there, Kvothe.

We need to talk.\u201d He turned without looking at me and began to unhitch Alpha from the wagon.", "I\u2019d never seen Ben in a mood like this before. Worried that I\u2019d ruined things between us, I turned and ran to my parents\u2019 wagon.", "I found my mother sitting in front of a fresh fire, slowly adding twigs to build it up.

Straightforward would probably be best. \u201cNot much.\u201d", "\u201cSuppose he\u2019s twenty, and still thoughtless, how dangerous is he?\u201d", "I decided to stick with the obvious answers. \u201cStill not much, but more than before.\u201d", "\u201cWhat if you give him a sword?\u201d", "Realization started to dawn on me, and I closed my eyes. \u201cMore, much more. I understand, Ben. Really I do. Power is okay, and stupidity is usually harmless. Power and stupidity together are dangerous.\u201d", "\u201cI never said stupid,\u201d Ben corrected me. \u201cYou\u2019re clever. We both know that. But you can be thoughtless. A clever, thoughtless person is one of the most terrifying things there is. Worse, I\u2019ve been teaching you some dangerous things.\u201d", "Ben looked at the fire I\u2019d laid out, then picked up a leaf, mumbled a few words, and watched a small flame flicker into life in the center of the twigs and tinder. He turned to look at me. \u201cYou could kill yourself doing something as simple as that.\u201d He gave a sickly grin. \u201cOr looking for the name of the wind.\u201d", "He started to say something else, then stopped and rubbed his face with his hands. He gave a great sigh that seemed to deflate him. When he took his hands away, his face was tired. \u201cHow old are you again?\u201d", "\u201cTwelve next month.\u201d", "He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to forget that. You don\u2019t act your age.\u201d He poked at the fire with a stick, \u201cI was eighteen when I began at the University,\u201d he said. \u201cI was twenty before I knew as much as you do now.\u201d He stared into the fire. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Kvothe. I need to be alone tonight. I need to do some thinking.\u201d", "I nodded silently. I went to his wagon, gathered tripod and kettle, water and tea. I brought them back and quietly laid them beside Ben. He was still staring into the fire when I turned away", "Knowing my parents wouldn\u2019t expect me back for a while, I headed into the forest. I had some thinking of my own to do. I owed Ben that much. I wished I could do more.", "", "It took a full span of days before Ben was his normal, jovial self again. But even then things weren\u2019t the same between us. We were still fast friends, but there was something between us, and I could tell he was consciously holding himself apart.", "Lessons ground to a near standstill. He halted my fledgling study of alchemy, limiting me to chemistry instead. He refused to teach me any sygaldry at all, and on top of everything else, he began to ration what little sympathy he thought safe for me.", "I chafed at the delays, but held my peace, trusting that if I showed myself to be responsible and meticulously careful, he would eventually relax and things would return to normal.

The official story was that she needed someone to tutor her young son. However, anyone who saw the two of them walking together knew the truth behind that story.", "She had been the brewer\u2019s wife, but he had drowned two years ago. She was trying to run the brewery as best she could, but she didn\u2019t really have the know-how to do a good job of it....", "As you can see, I don\u2019t think anyone could have built a better snare for Ben if they had tried.", "", "Plans were changed and the troupe stayed on at Hallowfell for a few extra days. My twelfth birthday was moved up and combined with Ben\u2019s going away party.", "To truly understand what it was like, you must realize that nothing is so grand as a troupe showing off for one another. Good entertainers try to make each performance seem special, but you need to remember that the show they\u2019re putting on for you is the same one they\u2019ve put on for hundreds of other audiences. Even the most dedicated troupes have an occasional lackluster performance, especially when they know they can get away with it.", "Small towns, rural inns, those places didn\u2019t know good entertainment from bad. Your fellow performers did.", "Think then, how do you entertain the people who have seen your act a thousand times? You dust off the old tricks. You try out some new ones. You hope for the best. And, of course, the grand failures are as entertaining as the great successes.", "I remember the evening as a wonderful blur of warm emotion, tinged in bitter. Fiddles, lutes, and drums, everyone played and danced and sang as they wished. I dare say we rivaled any faerie revel you can bring to mind.", "I got presents. Trip gave me a belt knife with a leather grip, claiming that all boys should have something they can hurt themselves with. Shandi gave me a lovely cloak she had made, scattered with little pockets for a boy\u2019s treasures. My parents gave me a lute, a beautiful thing of smooth dark wood. I had to play a song of course, and Ben sang with me. I slipped a little on the strings of the unfamiliar instrument, and Ben wandered off looking for notes once or twice, but it was nice.", "Ben opened up a small keg of mead he had been saving for \u201cjust such an occasion.\u201d I remember it tasting the way I felt, sweet and bitter and sullen.", "Several people had collaborated to write \u201cThe Ballad of Ben, Brewer Supreme.\u201d My father recited it as gravely as if it were the Modegan royal lineage while accompanying himself on a half harp. Everyone laughed until they hurt, and Ben twice as much as everyone else.", "At some point in the night, my mother swept me up and danced around in a great spinning circle. Her laughter sang out like music trailing in the wind. Her hair and skirt spun around me as she twirled. She smelled comforting, the way only mothers do. That smell, and the quick laughing kiss she gave me did more to ease the dull ache of Ben\u2019s leaving than all the entertainments combined.", "Shandi offered to do a special dance for Ben, but only if he came into her tent to see it. I\u2019d never seen Ben blush before, but he did it well. He hesitated, and when he refused it was obviously about as easy for him as tearing out his own soul. Shandi protested and pouted prettily, saying she\u2019d been practicing it for a long time. Finally she dragged him into the tent, their disappearance encouraged by a cheer from the entire troupe.", "Trip and Teren staged a mock sword fight that was one part breathtaking swordplay, one part dramatic soliloquy (provided by Teren), and one part buffoonery that I\u2019m sure Trip must have invented on the spot. It ranged all over the camp. In the course of the fight Trip managed to break his sword, hide under a lady\u2019s dress, fence with a sausage, and perform such fantastical acrobatics that it\u2019s a miracle he didn\u2019t seriously injure himself. Although he did split his pants up the back.", "Dax set himself alight while attempting a spectacular bit of fire breathing and had to be doused. All he suffered was a bit of singed beard and a slightly bruised pride. He recovered quickly under Ben\u2019s tender ministrations, a mug of mead, and a reminder that not everyone was cut out to have eyebrows.", "My parents sang \u201cThe Lay of Sir Savien Traliard.\u201d Like most of the great songs, Sir Savien was written by Illien, and generally considered to be his crowning work.", "It\u2019s a beautiful song, made more so by the fact that I\u2019d only heard my father perform the whole thing a handful of times before. It\u2019s hellishly complex, and my father was probably the only one in the troupe who could do it justice. Though he didn\u2019t particularly show it, I knew it was taxing even for him. My mother sang the counter-harmony, her voice soft and lilting. Even the fire seemed subdued when they took a breath. I felt my heart lift and dive. I wept as much for the glory of two voices so perfectly enmeshed as for the tragedy of the song.", "Yes, I cried at the end of it. I did then, and I have every time since. Even a reading of the story aloud will bring tears to my eyes. In my opinion, anyone who isn\u2019t moved by it is less than human inside.", "There was a momentary quiet after they finished, wherein everyone wiped their eyes and blew their noses.

Everyone cheered.", "The crowd hushed as soon as he sat back down. He tuned a string or two, even though he\u2019d only just set it down. He flexed his fingers and struck a few soft, experimental notes, then swept into the song so gently that I caught myself listening to it before I knew it had begun.

Then a wide, wicked grin spread across his face and he bent to tuck his lute safely away. There was an outcry and a great deal of complaining, but everyone knew they had been lucky to hear as much as they had. Someone else struck up a song for dancing, and the protests faded away", "My parents danced together, her head on his chest. Both had their eyes closed. They seemed so perfectly content. If you can find someone like that, someone who you can hold and close your eyes to the world with, then you\u2019re lucky. Even if it only lasts for a minute or a day. The image of them gently swaying to the music is how I picture love in my mind even after all these years.", "Afterward, Ben danced with my mother, his steps sure and stately. I was struck by how beautiful they looked together. Ben, old, grey, and portly, with his lined face and half-burned eyebrows. My mother, slender, fresh, and bright, pale and smooth-skinned in the firelight. They complemented each other by contrast. I ached knowing I might never see them together again.", "By this time the sky was beginning to brighten in the east. Everyone gathered to say their final good-byes.", "I can\u2019t remember what I said to him before we left. I know it felt woefully inadequate, but I knew he understood. He made me promise not to get myself into any trouble, tinkering with the things he had taught me.", "He stooped a bit and gave me a hug, then tousled my hair. I didn\u2019t even mind. In semiretaliation I tried to smooth out his eyebrows, something I\u2019d always wanted to try.", "His expression was marvelous in its surprise. He gathered me into another hug. Then he stepped away", "My parents promised to steer the troupe back toward the town when we were in the area. All the troupers said they wouldn\u2019t need much steering. But, even as young as I was, I knew the truth. It would be a great long time before I saw him again. Years.", "I don\u2019t remember starting out that morning, but I do remember trying to sleep and feeling quite alone except for a dull, bittersweet ache.", "", "When I awoke later in the afternoon I found a package resting next to me. Wrapped in sackcloth and tied with twine, there was a bright piece of paper with my name fixed to the top, waving in the wind like a little flag.", "Unwrapping it, I recognized the book\u2019s binding. It was Rhetoric and Logic, the book Ben had used to teach me argument. Out of his small library of a dozen books it was the only one I hadn\u2019t read from cover to cover. I hated it.", "I cracked it open and saw writing on the inside cover. It said:", "\u201cKvothe,", "Defend yourself well at the University. Make me proud.", "Remember your father\u2019s song. Be wary of folly.", "Your friend,", "Abenthy.\u201d", "", "Ben and I had never discussed my attending the University. Of course I had dreams of going there, someday But they were dreams I hesitated to share with my parents. Attending the University would mean leaving my parents, my troupe, everyone and everything I had ever known.", "Quite frankly, the thought was terrifying. What would it be like to settle in one place, not just for an evening or a span of days, but for months? Years? No more performing? No tumbling with Trip, or playing the bratty young noble\u2019s son in Three Pennies for Wishing? No more wagons? No one to sing with?", "I\u2019d never said anything aloud, but Ben would have guessed.

If you were strong enough to saddle the horses, you saddled the horses. If your hands were quick enough, you juggled. If you were clean shaven and fit the dress, you played Lady Reythiel in The Swineherd and the Nightingale. Things were generally as simple as that.", "So Trip taught me how to jape and tumble. Shandi walked me though the courtly dances of a half dozen countries. Teren measured me against the hilt of his sword and judged that I had grown tall enough to begin the basics of swordplay. Not enough to actually fight, he stressed. But enough so I could make a good show of it on stage.", "The roads were good this time of year, so we made excellent time traveling north through the Commonwealth: fifteen, twenty miles a day as we searched out new towns to play. With Ben gone, I rode with my father more often, and he began my formal training for the stage.", "I already knew a great deal, of course. But what I had picked up was an undisciplined hodgepodge. My father systematically went about showing me the true mechanics of the actor\u2019s trade. How slight changes in accent or posture make a man seem oafish, or sly, or silly.", "Lastly, my mother began teaching me how to comport myself in polite society. I knew a little from our infrequent stays with Baron Greyfallow, and thought I was quite genteel enough without having to memorize forms of address, table manners, and the elaborate snarled rankings of the peerage. Eventually, I told my mother exactly that.", "\u201cWho cares if a Modegan viscount outranks a Vintish spara-thain?\u201d I protested. \u201cAnd who cares if one is \u2018your grace\u2019 and the other is \u2018my lord?\u2019 \u201d", "\u201cThey care,\u201d my mother said firmly. \u201cIf you perform for them, you need to conduct yourself with dignity and learn to keep your elbow out of the soup.\u201d", "\u201cFather doesn\u2019t worry about which fork to use and who outranks who,\u201d I groused.", "My mother frowned, her eyes narrowing.", "\u201cWho outranks whom,\u201d I said grudgingly.", "\u201cYour father knows more than he lets on,\u201d my mother said. \u201cAnd what he doesn\u2019t know he breezes past due to his considerable charm.

Or do you want to make me proud?\u201d", "There was only one answer to that. Once I knuckled down to learn it, it was just another type of acting. Another script. My mother made rhymes to help me remember the more nonsensical elements of etiquette. And together we wrote a dirty little song called \u201cThe Pontifex Always Ranks Under a Queen.\u201d We laughed over it for a solid month, and she strictly forbade me to sing it to my father, lest he play it in front of the wrong people someday and get us all into serious trouble.", "", "\u201cTree!\u201d The shout came faintly down the line. \u201cThreeweight oak!\u201d", "My father stopped in the middle of the monologue he had been reciting for me and gave an irritated sigh. \u201cThat\u2019ll be as far as we get today then,\u201d he grumbled, looking up at the sky.", "\u201cAre we stopping?\u201d my mother called from inside the wagon.", "\u201cAnother tree across the road,\u201d I explained.", "\u201cI swear,\u201d my father said, steering the wagon to a clear space at the side of the road. \u201cIs this the king\u2019s road or isn\u2019t it?

And if they hadn\u2019t started dinner by the time I came back, well, that was only fair, wasn\u2019t it?", "I hope they spent those last few hours well. I hope they didn\u2019t waste them on mindless tasks: kindling the evening fire and cutting vegetables for dinner. I hope they sang together, as they so often did. I hope they retired to our wagon and spent time in each other\u2019s arms. I hope they lay near each other afterward and spoke softly of small things.

It was quiet, as if everyone in the troupe was listening for something. As if they were all holding their breath. An idle wind tussled the leaves in the trees and wafted a patch of smoke like a low cloud toward me. I stepped out of the forest and through the smoke, heading into the camp.", "I left the cloud of smoke and rubbed some of the sting from my eyes. As I looked around I saw Trip\u2019s tent lying half collapsed and smoldering in his fire. The treated canvas burned fitfully, and the acrid grey smoke hung close to the ground in the quiet evening air.", "I saw Teren\u2019s body lying by his wagon, his sword broken in his hand. The green and grey he normally wore was wet and red with blood. One of his legs was twisted unnaturally and the splintered bone showing through the skin was very, very white.", "I stood, unable to look away from Teren, the grey shirt, the red blood, the white bone. I stared as if it were a diagram in a book I was trying to understand. My body grew numb. I felt as if I was trying to think through syrup.", "Some small rational part of me realized I was in deep shock. It repeated the fact to me again and again. I used all Ben\u2019s training to ignore it. I did not want to think about what I saw. I did not want to know what had happened here. I did not want to know what any of this meant.", "After I don\u2019t know how long, a wisp of smoke broke my line of vision. I sat down next to the nearest fire in a daze. It was Shandi\u2019s fire, and a small pot hung simmering, boiling potatoes, strangely familiar among the chaos.", "I focused on the kettle. Something normal. I used a stick to poke at the contents and saw that they were finished cooking. Normal. I lifted the kettle from the fire and set it on the ground next to Shandi\u2019s body. Her clothes hung in tatters about her. I tried to brush her hair away from her face and my hand came back sticky with blood. The firelight reflected in her flat, empty eyes.", "I stood and looked about aimlessly.

Peering around the corner of Shandi\u2019s wagon I saw several unfamiliar men and women sitting around a fire. My parents\u2019 fire. A dizziness swept over me and I reached out a hand to steady myself against the wagon\u2019s wheel. When I gripped it, the iron bands that reinforced the wheel crumbled in my hand, flaking away in gritty sheets of brown rust. When I pulled my hand away the wheel creaked and began to crack. I stepped back as it gave way, the wagon splintering as if its wood were rotten as an old stump.", "I now stood in full view of the fire. One of the men tumbled backward and came to his feet with his sword out. His motion reminded me of quicksilver rolling from a jar onto a tabletop: effortless and supple. His expression was intent, but his body was relaxed, as if he had just stood and stretched.", "His sword was pale and elegant. When it moved, it cut the air with a brittle sound. It reminded me of the quiet that settles on the coldest days in winter when it hurts to breathe and everything is still.", "He was two dozen feet from me, but I could see him perfectly in the fading light of sunset. I remember him as clearly as I remember my own mother, sometimes better. His face was narrow and sharp, with the perfect beauty of porcelain. His hair was shoulder length, framing his face in loose curls the color of frost. He was a creature of winter\u2019s pale. Everything about him was cold and sharp and white.", "Except his eyes. They were black like a goat\u2019s but with no iris. His eyes were like his sword, and neither one reflected the light of the fire or the setting sun.", "He relaxed when he saw me. He dropped the tip of his sword and smiled with perfect ivory teeth. It was the expression a nightmare wore. I felt a stab of feeling penetrate the confusion I clutched around me like a thick protective blanket. Something put both its hands deep into my chest and clutched. It may have been the first time in my life I was ever truly afraid.", "Back by the fire, a bald man with a grey beard chuckled. \u201cLooks like we missed a little rabbit. Careful Cinder, his teeth may be sharp.\u201d", "The one called Cinder sheathed his sword with the sound of a tree cracking under the weight of winter ice. Keeping his distance, he knelt. Again I was reminded of the way mercury moved. Now on eye level with me, his expression grew concerned behind his matte-black eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, boy?\u201d", "I stood there, mute. Frozen as a startled fawn.", "Cinder sighed and dropped his gaze to the ground for a moment. When he looked back up at me I saw pity staring at me with hollow eyes.", "\u201cYoung man,\u201d he said, \u201cwherever are your parents?\u201d He held my gaze for a moment and then looked over his shoulder back toward the fire where the others sat.", "\u201cDoes anyone know where his parents are?\u201d", "Some of them smiled, hard and brittle, as if enjoying a particularly good joke. One or two of them laughed aloud. Cinder turned back to me and the pity fell away like a cracked mask, leaving only the nightmare smile upon his face.", "\u201cIs this your parents\u2019 fire?\u201d he asked with a terrible delight in his voice.", "I nodded numbly.", "His smile slowly faded. Expressionless, he looked deep into me. His voice was quiet, cold, and sharp. \u201cSomeone\u2019s parents,\u201d he said, \u201chave been singing entirely the wrong sort of songs.\u201d", "\u201cCinder.\u201d A cool voice came from the direction of the fire.", "His black eyes narrowed in irritation. \u201cWhat?\u201d he hissed.", "\u201cYou are approaching my displeasure. This one has done nothing. Send him to the soft and painless blanket of his sleep.\u201dThe cool voice caught slightly on the last word, as if it were difficult to say.", "The voice came from a man who sat apart from the rest, wrapped in shadow at the edge of the fire. Though the sky was still bright with sunset and nothing stood between the fire and where he sat, shadow pooled around him like thick oil. The fire snapped and danced, lively and warm, tinged with blue, but no flicker of its light came close to him. The shadow gathered thicker around his head. I could catch a glimpse of a deep cowl like some priests wear, but underneath the shadows were so deep it was like looking down a well at midnight.", "Cinder glanced briefly at the shadowed man, then turned away. \u201cYou are as good as a watcher, Haliax,\u201d he snapped.", "\u201cAnd you seem to forget our purpose,\u201d the dark man said, his cool voice sharpening. \u201cOr does your purpose simply differ from my own?\u201d The last words were spoken carefully, as if they held special significance.", "Cinder\u2019s arrogance left him in a second, like water poured from a bucket. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, turning back toward the fire. \u201cNo, certainly not.\u201d", "\u201cThat is good. I hate to think of our long acquaintance coming to an end.\u201d", "\u201cAs do I.\u201d", "\u201cRefresh me again as to our relationship, Cinder,\u201d the shadowed man said, a deep sliver of anger running through his patient tone.", "\u201cI ...

That meant it had been several hours since I had tried the water. Since it hadn\u2019t made me sick, I decided it must be safe and took a long drink.", "Rather than refreshing me, all my drink did was make me aware of how hungry I was. I sat on the stone by the edge of the pool. I stripped the leaves from the stalks of motherleaf and ate one. It was rough, papery, and bitter. I ate the rest, but it didn\u2019t help.

Seth looked at me, shading his eyes with a hand. \u201cWhat are ye doin\u2019 in town today, boy?\u201d", "\u201cI need lute strings,\u201d I said. Only then did I realize I didn\u2019t know where my father\u2019s lute was. I looked around wildly. It wasn\u2019t in the wagon where", "I\u2019d left it, or leaning against the wall, or on the piles of squash. My stomach clenched until I spotted it underneath some loose burlap sacking. I walked over to it and picked it up with shaking hands.", "The older farmer grinned at me and held out a pair of the knobby squash we\u2019d been unloading. \u201cHow would your mother like it if you brought home a couple of the finest orange butter squash this side of the Eld?\u201d", "\u201cNo, I can\u2019t,\u201d I stammered, pushing away a memory of raw fingers digging in the mud and the smell of burning hair. \u201cI m\u2014mean, you\u2019ve already ...\u201d I trailed off, clutching my lute closer to my chest and moving a couple of steps away", "He looked at me more closely, as if seeing me for the first time. Suddenly self-conscious, I imagined how I must look: ragged and half-starved. I hugged the lute and backed farther away. The farmer\u2019s hands fell to his side and his smile faded. \u201cAh, lad,\u201d he said softly.", "He set the squash down, then turned back to me and spoke with a gentle seriousness. \u201cMe and Jake will be here selling until round about sundown. If you find what you\u2019re looking for by then, you\u2019d be welcome back on the farm with us. The missus and me could sure use an extra hand some days. You\u2019d be more than welcome. Wouldn\u2019t he Jake?\u201d", "Jake was looking at me too, pity written across his honest face. \u201cSure enough, Pa. She said so right afore we left.\u201d", "The old farmer continued to look at me with serious eyes. \u201cThis is Seaward Square.\u201d He said, pointing at his feet. \u201cWe\u2019ll be here till dark, maybe a little after. You come back if\u2019n you want a ride.\u201d His eyes turned worried. \u201cYou hear me? You can come back with us.\u201d", "I continued to back away, step by step, not sure why I was doing it. Only knowing that if I went with him I would have to explain, would have to remember. Anything was better than opening that door....", "\u201cNo. No, thank you,\u201d I stammered. \u201cYou\u2019ve helped so much. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d I was jostled from behind by a man in a leather apron. Startled, I turned and ran.", "I heard one of them call out behind me, but the crowd drowned them out. I ran, my heart heavy in my chest.", "", "Tarbean is big enough that you cannot walk from one end to the other in a single day. Not even if you avoid getting lost or accosted in the tangled web of twisting streets and dead end alleys.", "It was too big, actually. It was vast, immense. Seas of people, forests of buildings, roads wide as rivers. It smelled like urine and sweat and coal smoke and tar. If I had been in my right mind, I never would have gone there.", "In the fullness of time, I became lost. I took a turn too early or too late, then tried to compensate by cutting through an alley like a narrow chasm between two tall buildings. It wound like a gully carved by a river that had left to find a cleaner bed. Garbage drifted up the walls and filled the cracks between buildings and the alcove doorways. After I had taken several turns I caught the rancid smell of something dead.", "I turned a corner and staggered against a wall as pain stars blinded me. I felt rough hands grab hold of my arms.", "I opened my eyes to see an older boy. He was twice my size with dark hair and savage eyes. The dirt that smudged his face gave him the appearance of having a beard, making his young face strangely cruel.", "Two other boys jerked me away from the wall. I yelped as one of them twisted my arm. The older boy smiled at the sound and ran a hand through his hair. \u201cWhat are you doin\u2019 here, Nalt? You lost?\u201d His grin broadened.", "I tried to pull away but one of the boys twisted my wrist and I gasped, \u201cNo.\u201d", "\u201cI think he\u2019s lost, Pike,\u201d the boy on my right said. The one on my left elbowed me sharply in the side of the head and the alley tilted crazily around me.", "Pike laughed.", "\u201cI\u2019m looking for the Woodworks,\u201d I muttered, slightly stunned.", "Pike\u2019s expression turned murderous. His hands grabbed my shoulders. \u201cDid I ask you a question?\u201d he shouted. \u201cDid I say you could talk?\u201d He slammed his forehead into my face and I felt a sharp crack followed by an explosion of pain.", "\u201cHey, Pike.\u201d The voice seemed to come from an impossible direction. A foot nudged my lute case, tipping it over. \u201cHey Pike, look at this.\u201d", "Pike looked down at the hollow thump as the lute case fell flat against the ground. \u201cWhat did you steal, Nalt?\u201d", "\u201cI didn\u2019t steal it.\u201d", "One of the boys holding my arms laughed. \u201cYeah, your uncle gave it to you so you could sell it to buy medicine for your sick grandma.\u201d He laughed again while I tried to blink the tears out of my eyes.", "I heard three clicks as the latches were undone. Then came the distinctive harmonic thrum as the lute was taken out of its case.", "\u201cYour grandma is gonna be mighty sorry you lost this, Nalt,\u201d Pike\u2019s voice was quiet.", "\u201cTehlu crush us!\u201d the boy on my right exploded. \u201cPike, ya know how much one of them\u2019s worth? Gold, Pike!\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t say Tehlu\u2019s name like that,\u201d said the boy on my left.", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "\u201c \u2018Do not call on Tehlu save in the greatest need, for Tehlu judges every thought and deed,\u2019 \u201d he recited.", "\u201cTehlu and his great glowing penis can piss all over me if that thing isn\u2019t worth twenty talents.

My beautiful lute. He had a dreamy look in his eyes as he held it, turning it over and over in his dirty hands. A slow horror was dawning on me through the haze of fear and pain.", "As the two voices grew louder behind me, I began to feel a hot anger inside. I tensed. I couldn\u2019t fight them, but I knew if I got hold of my lute and made it into a crowd I could lose them and be safe again.", "\u201c... but she kept humping away anyway. But now she only got a halfpenny a throw. That\u2019s why your head is so soft. You\u2019re lucky you don\u2019t have a dent.

I hear Tehlu likes to hide behind big clumps of horseshit and th\u2014\u201d", "Suddenly both of my arms were free as one boy tackled the other into the wall. I sprinted the three steps to Pike, grabbed the lute by the neck, and pulled.", "But Pike was quicker than I\u2019d expected, or stronger. The lute didn\u2019t come away in my hand. I was jerked to a halt and Pike was pulled to his feet.", "My frustration and anger boiled over. I let go of the lute and threw myself at Pike. I clawed madly at his face and neck, but he was a veteran of too many street fights to let me get close to anything vital. One of my fingernails tore a line of blood across his face from ear to chin. Then he was against me, pressing me back until I hit the alley wall.", "My head struck brick, and I would have fallen if Pike hadn\u2019t been grinding me into the crumbling wall. I gasped for breath and only then realized I\u2019d been screaming all the while.", "He smelled like old sweat and rancid oil. His hands pinned my arms to my sides as he pressed me harder into the wall. I was dimly aware that he must have dropped my lute.", "I gasped for breath again and flailed blindly, knocking my head against the wall again. I found my face pressed into his shoulder and bit down hard. I felt his skin break under my teeth and tasted blood.", "Pike screamed and jerked away from me. I drew a breath and winced at a tearing pain in my chest.", "Before I could move or think, Pike grabbed me again. He bludgeoned me up against the wall once, twice. My head whipsawed back and forth, caroming off the wall. Then he grabbed me by the throat, spun me around, and threw me to the ground.", "That\u2019s when I heard the noise, and everything seemed to stop.", "", "After my troupe was murdered, there were times when I would dream of my parents, alive and singing. In my dream their deaths had been a mistake, a misunderstanding, a new play they had been rehearsing. And for a few moments I had relief from the great blanketing grief that was constantly crushing me. I hugged them and we laughed at my foolish worry. I sang with them, and for a moment everything was wonderful. Wonderful.", "But I always woke up, alone in the dark by the forest pool. What was I doing out here? Where were my parents?", "Then I would remember everything, like a wound ripping open. They were dead and I was terribly alone. And that great weight that had been lifted for just a moment would come crushing down again, worse than before because I wasn\u2019t ready for it. Then I would lay on my back, staring into the dark with my chest aching and my breath coming hard, knowing deep inside that nothing would ever be right, ever again.", "When Pike threw me to the ground, my body was almost too numb to feel my father\u2019s lute being crushed underneath me. The sound it made was like a dying dream, and it brought that same sick, breathless ache back to my chest.", "I looked around and saw Pike breathing heavily and clutching his shoulder. One of the boys was kneeling on the chest of the other. They weren\u2019t wrestling anymore, both were looking in my direction, stunned.", "I stared numbly at my hands, bloody where slivers of wood had pierced the skin.", "\u201cLittle bastard bit me,\u201d Pike said quietly, as if he couldn\u2019t quite believe what had happened.", "\u201cGet off me,\u201d said the boy lying on his back.", "\u201cI said you shouldn\u2019t say those things.

Get off me and grab that thing. It might still be worth something to Diken.\u201d", "\u201cLook what you did!\u201d Pike continued to howl above me. A kick caught me in the side and rolled me halfway over. The edges of my vision started to darken. I almost welcomed it as a distraction. But the deeper pain was still there, untouched. I balled my bloody hands into stinging fists.", "\u201cThese knob things still seem okay They\u2019re silvery, I\u2019ll bet we can get something for them.\u201d", "Pike pulled back his foot again.

Pike!\u201d", "Pike kicked me in the stomach again and I vomited weakly onto the cobblestones.", "\u201cYou there, stop! City Watch!\u201d A new voice shouted. A heartbeat of stillness was followed by a scuffle and a flurry of pattering feet. A second later, heavy boots pounded past and faded in the distance.", "I remember the ache in my chest. I blacked out.", "", "I was shaken out of darkness by someone turning my pockets inside out. I tried unsuccessfully to open my eyes.", "I heard a voice muttering to itself, \u201cIs this all I get for saving your life? Copper and a couple shims? Drinks for an evening? Worthless little sod.\u201d He coughed deep in his chest and the smell of stale liquor washed over me. \u201cScreaming like that.

That\u2019s something, I suppose.\u201d I heard a grunt as he stood up, then the heavy thumping of his boots faded away into silence.", "After a while I found I could open my eyes. My vision was blurry and my nose felt larger than the rest of my head. I prodded it delicately Broken. Remembering what Ben had taught me, I put one hand on each side of it and twisted it sharply back into place. I clenched my teeth against a cry of pain, and my eyes filled with tears.", "I blinked them away and was relieved when I saw the street without the painful blurriness of a moment ago. The contents of my small sack lay next to me on the ground: a half ball of string, a small dull knife, Rhetoric and Logic, and the remainder of a piece of bread the farmer had given me for lunch. It seemed like forever ago.", "The farmer. I thought of Seth and Jake. Soft bread and butter. Songs while riding in a wagon. Their offer of a safe place, a new home....", "A sudden memory was followed by a sudden sickening panic. I looked around the alley, my head aching from the sudden movement. Sifting the garbage with my hands I found some terribly familiar shards of wood. I stared at them mutely as the world darkened imperceptibly around me. I darted a look at the thin strip of sky visible overhead and saw it was purpling into twilight.", "How late was it? I hurried to gather my possessions, treating Ben\u2019s book more gently than the rest, and limped off in what I hoped was the direction of Seaward Square.", "", "The last of twilight had faded from the sky by the time I found the square. A few wagons rolled sluggishly among the few straggling customers. I limped wildly from corner to corner of the square, searching madly for the old farmer who had given me a ride. Searching for the sight of one of those ugly, knobby squash.", "When I finally found the bookstore Seth had parked beside, I was panting and staggering. Seth and his wagon were nowhere to be seen. I sank down into the empty space their wagon had left and felt the aches and pains of a dozen injuries that I had forced myself to ignore.", "I felt them out, one by one. I had several painful ribs, although I couldn\u2019t tell if they were broken or if the cartilage was torn. I was dizzy and nauseous when I moved my head too quickly, probably a concussion. My nose was broken, and I had more bruises and scrapes than I could conveniently count. I was also hungry.", "The last being the only thing I could do anything about, I took what was left of my piece of bread from earlier in the day and ate it. It wasn\u2019t enough, but it was better than nothing. I took a drink from a horse trough and was thirsty enough not to care that the water was brackish and sour.", "I thought of leaving, but it would take me hours of walking in my current condition. Besides, there was nothing waiting for me on the outskirts of the city except miles upon miles of harvested farmland. No trees to keep the wind away. No wood to make a fire. No rabbits to set traps for. No roots to dig. No heather for a bed.", "I was so hungry my stomach was a hard knot. Here at least I could smell chicken cooking somewhere. I would have gone looking for the smell, but I was dizzy, and my ribs hurt. Maybe tomorrow someone would give me something to eat. Right now I was too tired. I wanted nothing more than to sleep.", "The cobblestones were losing the last of the sun\u2019s heat and the wind was picking up. I moved back into the doorway of the bookshop to get out of the wind. I was almost asleep when the owner of the shop opened the door and kicked at me, telling me to shove off or he\u2019d call the guard. I limped away as quickly as I could.", "After that I found some empty crates in an alley. I curled up behind them, bruised and weary.

Though I attributed it more to the laws of probability than from any human kindness. Even a blind pig finds an acorn once in a while.", "I had been living in Tarbean for nearly a month, and the day before I had tried my hand at stealing for the first time. It was an inauspicious beginning. I\u2019d been caught with my hand in a butcher\u2019s pocket. This had earned me such a tremendous blow to the side of the head that today I was dizzy when I tried to stand or move about quickly. Hardly encouraged by my first foray into thievery, I had decided that today was a begging day. As such, it was about average.", "Hunger knotted my stomach, and a single shim\u2019s worth of stale bread wasn\u2019t going to help much. I was considering moving to a different street when I saw a boy run up to a younger beggar across the way. They talked excitedly for a moment then hurried off.", "I followed of course, showing a pale shadow of my former burning curiosity. Besides, anything that moved the two of them away from a busy street corner in the middle of the day was bound to be worth my while. Maybe the Tehlins were giving out bread again. Or a fruit cart had tipped over. Or the guard was hanging someone. That would be worth half an hour of my time.", "I followed the boys through the twisting streets until I saw them turn a corner and scurry down a flight of stairs into the basement of a burned-out building. I stopped, my dim spark of curiosity smothered by my common sense.", "A moment later they reappeared, each carrying a chunk of flat brown bread. I watched as they wandered past, laughing and shoving at each other. The youngest, no more than six, saw me looking and waved.", "\u201cStill some left,\u201d he called through a mouthful of bread. \u201cBetter hurrup though.\u201d", "My common sense did a rapid turnaround, and I headed cautiously downward. At the bottom of the steps were a few rotting planks, all that remained of a broken door. Inside I could see a short hallway opening out into a dimly lit room. A young girl with hard eyes pushed past me without looking up. She clutched another piece of bread.", "I stepped over the broken pieces of door into the chill, damp dark. After a dozen steps I heard a low moan that froze me where I stood. It was almost an animal sound, but my ear told me it came from a human throat.", "I don\u2019t know what I expected, but it was nothing like what I found. Two ancient lamps burned fish oil, throwing dim shadows against the dark stone walls. There were six cots in the room, all occupied. Two children that were hardly more than babies shared a blanket on the stone floor, and another was curled up in a pile of rags. A boy my age sat in a dark corner, his head pressed against the wall.", "One of the boys moved slightly on his cot, as if stirring in his sleep. But something was wrong with the movement. It was too strained, too tense. I looked closer and saw the truth. He was tied to the cot. All of them were.", "He strained against the ropes and made the noise I had heard in the hall. It was clearer now, a long moaning cry. \u201cAaaaaaabaaaaaaah.\u201d", "For a moment all I could do was think about every story I had ever heard about the Duke of Gibea. About how he and his men had abducted and tortured people for twenty years before the church had gone in and put an end to it.", "\u201cWhat what,\u201d came a voice from the other room. The voice had an odd inflection to it, as if it wasn\u2019t really asking a question.", "The boy on the cot jerked against his ropes. \u201cAaaahbeeeeh.\u201d", "A man came through the doorway brushing his hands on the front of his tattered robe. \u201cWhat what,\u201d he repeated in the same not-questioning tone.

Not the sort of voice I expected a Duke-of-Gibea type to have.", "\u201cWhat what. Hush hush,Tanee. I wan\u2019t gone, just stepped away Now I\u2019m here.\u201d His feet made slapping sounds against the bare stone floor. He was barefoot. I felt the tension slowly spill out of me. Whatever was going on here, it didn\u2019t seem nearly as sinister as I had originally thought.", "The boy stopped straining against the ropes when he saw the man approaching. \u201cEeeeeeaah.\u201d He said, and tugged against the ropes restraining him.", "\u201cWhat?\u201d It was a question this time.", "\u201cEeeeeeaah.\u201d", "\u201cHmmm?\u201d The old man looked around and saw me for the first time. \u201cOh. Hello.\u201d He looked back to the boy on the bed. \u201cWell aren\u2019t you the clever one today? Tanee called me in to see we have a visitor!\u201d Tanee\u2019s face broke into a terrific grin and he gave a harsh, honking gasp of breath. In spite of the painful sound, it was clear he was laughing.", "Turning to look at me, the barefoot man said, \u201cI don\u2019t recognize you. Have you been here before?\u201d", "I shook my head.", "\u201cWell, I\u2019ve got some bread, only two days old. If you carry some water for me, you can have as much as you can eat.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cDoes that sound all right?\u201d", "I nodded. A chair, table, and an open barrel standing near one of the doors were the only furnishings in the room aside from the cots. Four large, round loaves were stacked on the table.", "He nodded too, then began to move carefully toward the chair. He walked gingerly, as if it pained him to set his feet down.", "After he reached the chair and sank into it, he pointed to the barrel by the doorway. \u201cThrough the door there\u2019s a pump and bucket. Don\u2019t bother to hurry, it\u2019s na a race.\u201d As he spoke he absentmindedly crossed his legs and began to rub one of his bare feet.", "Inefficient circulation, a long-unused part of me thought.

It\u2019s wet enough down here.\u201d He eased his foot back to the floor and bent to gather up one of the tiny children who was beginning to stir restlessly on the blanket.", "As I filled the barrel I snuck glances at the man. His hair was grey, but despite that and the slow, tender manner in which he walked, he wasn\u2019t very old. Perhaps forty, probably a little less. He wore a long robe, patched and mended to such a degree that I couldn\u2019t really guess at its original color or shape. Though nearly as ragged as I was, he was cleaner. Which isn\u2019t to say that he was clean exactly, just cleaner than me. It wasn\u2019t hard to be.", "His name was Trapis. The patched robe was the only piece of clothing he owned. He spent nearly every moment of his waking life in that damp basement caring for the hopeless people no one else would bother with. Most of them were young boys. Some, like Tanee, had to be restrained so they wouldn\u2019t hurt themselves or roll out of their beds. Others, like Jaspin who had gone fever-mad two years ago, had to be restrained so they wouldn\u2019t hurt others.", "Palsied, crippled, catatonic, spastic, Trapis tended them all with equal and unending patience. I never once heard him complain of anything, not even his bare feet, which were always swollen and must have pained him constantly.", "He gave us children what help he could, a bit of food when he had some to spare. To earn a little something to eat we carried water, scrubbed his floor, ran errands, and held the babies so they wouldn\u2019t cry We did whatever he asked, and when there wasn\u2019t any food we could always have a drink of water, a tired smile, and someone who looked at us as if we were human, not animals in rags.", "Sometimes it seemed that Trapis alone was trying to care for all the hopeless creatures in our corner of Tarbean. In return we loved him with a silent ferocity that only animals can match. If anyone had ever raised a hand to Trapis, a hundred howling children would have torn them to bloody scraps in the middle of the street.", "I stopped by his basement often in those first few months, then less and less as time went by. Trapis and Tanee were fine companions. None of us felt the need to talk much, and that suited me fine. But the other street children made me unspeakably nervous, so I visited infrequently, only when I was in desperate need of help, or when I had something to share.", "Despite the fact that I was seldom there, it was good to know there was one place in the city where I wouldn\u2019t be kicked at, chased, or spit on. It helped when I was out on the rooftops alone, knowing that Trapis and the basement were there. It was almost like a home you could come back to.

The Tehlins sometimes gave out bread, making us say prayers before we could take our loaf. I didn\u2019t mind. It was easier than begging. Sometimes the grey-robed priests tried to get me to come into the church to say the prayers, but I\u2019d heard rumors and ran away whenever I was asked, whether I had my loaf or no.", "I learned how to hide. I had a secret place atop an old tannery where three roofs met, making a shelter from the wind and rain. Ben\u2019s book I secreted away under the rafters, wrapped in canvas. I handled it only rarely, like a holy relic. It was the last solid piece of my past, and I took every precaution to keep it safe.", "I learned that Tarbean is vast. You cannot understand if you have not seen it yourself. It is like the ocean. I can tell you of the waves and water, but you don\u2019t begin to get an inkling of its size until you stand on the shore. You don\u2019t really understand the ocean until you are in the midst of it, nothing but ocean on all sides, stretching away endlessly. Only then do you realize how small you are, how powerless.", "Part of Tarbean\u2019s vastness is the fact that it is divided into a thousand small pieces, each with its own personality. There was Downings, Drover Court, the Wash, Middletown, Tallows, Tunning, Dockside, the Tarway, Seamling Lane.... You could live your whole life in Tarbean and never know all its parts.", "But for most practical purposes Tarbean had two pieces: Waterside and Hillside. Waterside is where people are poor. That makes them beggars, thieves, and whores. Hillside is where people are rich. That makes them solicitors, politicians, and courtesans.", "I had been in Tarbean for two months when I first thought to try my hand at begging Hillside. Winter gripped the city firmly and the Midwinter Pageantry was making the streets more dangerous than usual.", "This was shocking to me. Every winter for the entirety of my young life our troupe had organized the Midwinter Pageantry for some town. Dressed in demon masks, we would terrorize them for the seven days of High Mourning, much to everyone\u2019s delight. My father played an Encanis so convincing you\u2019d think we\u2019d conjured him. Most importantly, he could be frightening and careful at the same time. No one was ever hurt when our troupe was in charge.", "But in Tarbean it was different. Oh, the pieces of the pageantry were all the same. There were still men in garishly painted demon masks skulking about the city, making mischief. Encanis was out there too, in the traditional black mask, making more serious trouble. And though I hadn\u2019t seen him, I didn\u2019t doubt that silver-masked Tehlu was striding around the better neighborhoods, playing his part. As I said, the pieces of the pageantry were the same.", "But they played out differently. For one thing, Tarbean was too big for one troupe to provide enough demons. A hundred troupes wouldn\u2019t be enough. So, rather than pay for professionals, as would be sensible and safe, the churches in Tarbean took the more profitable path of selling demon masks.", "Because of this, on the first day of High Mourning ten thousand demons were set loose on the city. Ten thousand amateur demons, with license to make whatever mischief they had minds to.", "This might seem like an ideal situation for a young thief to take advantage of, but really the opposite was true. The demons were always thickest Waterside. And while the great majority behaved properly, fleeing at the sound of Tehlu\u2019s name and keeping their devilry within reasonable bounds, many did not. Things were dangerous the first few days of High Mourning, and I spent most of my time simply staying out of harm\u2019s way.", "But as Midwinter approached, things settled down. The number of demons steadily decreased as people lost their masks or tired of the game. Tehlu no doubt eliminated his share as well, but silver mask or no, he was only one man. He could hardly cover the whole of Tarbean in just seven days\u2019 time.", "I chose the last day of Mourning for my trip Hillside. Spirits are always high on Midwinter\u2019s Day, and high spirits mean good begging. Best of all, the ranks of the demons were noticeably thinned, which meant it was reasonably safe to be walking the streets again.", "I set out in the early afternoon, hungry because I couldn\u2019t find any bread to steal. I remember feeling vaguely excited as I headed toward Hillside. Maybe some part of me remembered what Midwinter had been like with my family: warm meals and warm beds afterward. Maybe I had been infected by the smell of evergreen boughs being gathered into piles and set ablaze in celebration of Tehlu\u2019s triumph.", "That day I learned two things. I learned why beggars stay Waterside, and I learned that no matter what the church might tell you, Midwinter is a time for demons.", "", "I emerged from an alley and was instantly struck by the difference in atmosphere between this part of the city and where I had come from.", "Waterside, merchants wheedled and cajoled customers, hoping to lure them into their shops. Should that fail, they were not shy about bursting into fits of bellicosity: cursing or even openly bullying customers.", "Here the shop owners wrung their hands nervously. They bowed and scraped and were unfailingly polite. Voices were never raised. After the brutal reality of things Waterside, it seemed to me as if I had stumbled into a formal ball. Everyone was dressed in new clothes. Everyone was clean, and they all seemed to be participating in some sort of intricate social dance.", "But there were shadows here, too. As I surveyed the street I spotted a pair of men lurking in the alleyway across from me. Their masks were quite good, bloodred and fierce. One had a gaping mouth and the other a grimace of pointed white teeth. They were both wearing the traditional black hooded robes, which I approved of. So many of the demons Waterside didn\u2019t bother with the proper costume.", "The pair of demons slipped out to follow a well-dressed young couple who were strolling idly down the street, arm in arm. The demons stalked them carefully for nearly a hundred feet, then one of them snatched the gentleman\u2019s hat and thrust it into a nearby snowdrift. The other grabbed the woman in a rough embrace and lifted her from the ground. She shrieked while the man struggled with the demon for possession of his walking stick, obviously flummoxed by the situation.", "Luckily his lady maintained her composure. \u201cTehus! Tehus!\u201d she shouted. \u201cTehus antausa eha!\u201d", "At the sound of Tehlu\u2019s name the two red-masked figures cowered, then turned and ran off down the street.", "Everyone cheered. One of the shopkeepers helped the gentleman retrieve his hat. I was rather surprised by the civility of it all. Apparently even the demons were polite on the good side of town.", "Emboldened by what I had seen, I eyed the crowd, looking for my best prospects. I stepped up to a young woman. She wore a powder blue dress and had a wrap of white fur. Her hair was long and golden, curled artfully around her face.", "As I stepped forward she looked down at me and stopped. I heard a startled intake of breath as one hand went to her mouth. \u201cPennies, ma\u2019am?\u201d I held out my hand and made it tremble just a little. My voice trembled too. \u201cPlease?\u201d I tried to look every bit as small and hopeless as I felt. I shuffled from foot to foot in the thin grey snow.", "\u201cYou poor dear,\u201d she sighed almost too quietly for me to hear. She fumbled with the purse at her side, either unable or unwilling to take her eyes from me. After a moment she looked inside her purse and brought something out. As she curled my fingers around it I felt the cold, reassuring weight of a coin.", "\u201cThank you, ma\u2019am,\u201d I said automatically, I looked down for a moment and saw silver glinting through my fingers. I opened my hand and saw a silver penny. A whole silver penny.", "I gaped. A silver penny was worth ten copper pennies, or fifty iron ones. More than that, it was worth a full belly every night for half a month. For an iron penny I could sleep on the floor at the Red Eye for the night, for two I could sleep on the hearth by the embers of the evening fire. I could buy a rag blanket that I would hide on the rooftops, keeping me warm all winter.", "I looked up at the woman, who was still looking down at me with pitying eyes. She couldn\u2019t know what this meant. \u201cLady, thank you,\u201d my voice cracked. I remembered one of the things that we said back when I lived in the troupe. \u201cMay all your stories be glad ones, and your roads be smooth and short.\u201d", "She smiled at me and might have said something, but I got a strange feeling near the base of my neck. Someone was watching me. On the street you either develop a sensitivity to certain things, or your life is miserable and short.", "I looked around and saw a shopkeeper talking with a guard and gesturing in my direction. This wasn\u2019t some Waterside guard. He was clean-shaven and upright. He wore a black leather jerkin with metal studs and carried a brass-bound club as long as his arm. I caught scraps of what the shopkeeper was saying.", "\u201c... customers. Who\u2019s going to buy chocolate with ...\u201d He gestured my way again and said something I couldn\u2019t catch. \u201c... pays you? That\u2019s right. Maybe I should mention ...\u201d", "The guard turned his head to look in my direction. I caught his eyes. I turned and ran.", "I headed for the first alley I saw, my thin shoes slipping on the light layer of snow that covered the ground. I heard his heavy boots pounding behind me as I turned into a second alley branching off from the first.", "My breath was burning in my chest as I looked for somewhere to go, somewhere to hide. But I didn\u2019t know this part of the city. There were no piles of trash to worm into, no burned-out buildings to climb through. I felt sharp frozen gravel slice through the thin sole of one of my shoes. Pain tore through my foot as I forced myself to keep running.", "I ran into a dead end after my third turning. I was halfway up one of the walls when I felt a hand close around my ankle and pull me to the ground.", "My head hit the cobblestones and the world spun dizzily as the guard lifted me off the ground, holding me by one wrist and my hair. \u201cClever boy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he panted, his breath hot on my face. He smelled like leather and sweat. \u201cYou\u2019re old enough, you should know not to run by now.\u201d He shook me angrily and twisted my hair. I cried out as the alley tilted around me.", "He pressed me roughly against a wall. \u201cYou should know enough not to be coming Hillside either.\u201d He shook me. \u201cYou dumb, boy?\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d I said muzzily as I felt for the cool wall with my free hand. \u201cNo.\u201d", "My answer seemed to infuriate him. \u201cNo?\u201d he bit off the word. \u201cYou got me in trouble, boy. I might get written up. If you aren\u2019t dumb, then you must need a lesson.\u201d He spun me around and threw me down. I slid in the greasy alley snow. My elbow struck the ground and my arm went numb. The hand clutching a month of food, warm blankets, and dry shoes came open. Something precious flew away and landed without even a clink as it hit the ground.", "I hardly noticed. The air hummed before his club cracked against my leg. He snarled at me, \u201cDon\u2019t come Hillside, understand?\u201d The club caught me again, this time across the shoulder blades. \u201cEverything past Fallow Street is off limits to you little whore\u2019s sons. Understand?\u201d he backhanded me across the face and I tasted blood as my head careened off the snow-covered cobbles.", "I curled into a ball as he hissed down at me. \u201cAnd Mill Street and Mill Market is where I work, so you never. Come. Back. Here. Again.\u201d He punctuated each word with a blow from his stick. \u201cUnderstand?\u201d", "I lay there shaking in the churned-up snow, hoping it was over. Hoping he would just go away. \u201cUnderstand?\u201d He kicked me in the stomach and I felt something tear inside of me.", "I cried out and must have babbled something. He kicked me again when I didn\u2019t get up, then went away.", "I think I passed out or lay in a daze. When I finally came to my senses again, it was dusk. I was cold to the very center of my bones. I crawled around in the muddy snow and wet garbage, searching for the silver penny with fingers so numb with cold they would barely work.", "One of my eyes was swelled shut and I could taste blood, but I searched until the last scrap of evening\u2019s light was gone. Even after the alley had gone black as tar I kept sifting the snow with my hands, though I knew in my heart of hearts that my fingers were too numb to feel the coin even if I chanced across it.", "I used the wall to get to my feet and started to walk. My wounded foot made progress slow. Pain stabbed up my leg with each step, and I tried to use the wall as a crutch to keep some weight off it.", "I moved into Waterside, the part of the city that was more a home to me than anywhere else. My foot grew numb and wooden from the cold, and while that worried some rational piece of me, my practical side was just glad there was one less part of me that hurt.", "It was miles back to my secret place, and my limping progress was slow. At some point I must have fallen. I don\u2019t remember it, but I do remember lying in the snow and realizing how delightfully comfortable it was. I felt sleep drawing itself over me like a thick blanket, like death.", "I closed my eyes. I remember the deep silence of the deserted street around me. I was too numb and tired to be properly afraid. In my delirium, I imagined death in the form of a great bird with wings of fire and shadow. It hovered above, watching patiently, waiting for me....", "I slept, and the great bird settled its burning wings around me. I imagined a delicious warmth. Then its claws were in me, tearing me open\u2014", "No, it was just the pain of my torn ribs as someone rolled me onto my back.", "Blearily, I opened an eye and saw a demon standing over me. In my confused and credulous state, the sight of the man in the demon mask startled me into wakefulness, the seductive warmth I had felt a moment ago vanished, leaving my body limp and leaden.", "\u201cIt is. I told you. There\u2019s a kid lying in the snow here!\u201dThe demon lifted me to my feet.", "Now awake, I noticed his mask was sheer black. This was Encanis, Lord of Demons. He set me unsteadily onto my feet and began to brush away the snow that covered me.", "Through my good eye I saw a figure in a livid green mask standing nearby. \u201cCome on ...\u201d the other demon said urgently, her voice sounding hollowly from behind the rows of pointed teeth.", "Encanis ignored her. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d", "I couldn\u2019t think of a response, so I concentrated on keeping my balance as the man continued to brush the snow away with the sleeve of his dark robe. I heard the sound of distant horns.", "The other demon looked nervously down the road. \u201cIf we don\u2019t keep ahead of them we\u2019ll be up to our shins in it,\u201d she hissed nervously.", "Encanis brushed the snow out of my hair with his dark gloved fingers, then paused and leaned in closer to look at my face. His dark mask loomed oddly in my blurry vision.", "\u201cGod\u2019s body, Holly, someone\u2019s beaten hell out of this kid. On Midwinter\u2019s Day, too.\u201d", "\u201cGuard,\u201d I managed to croak. I tasted blood when I said the word.", "\u201cYou\u2019re freezing,\u201d Encanis said and began to chafe my arms and legs with his hands, trying to get my blood flowing again. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to come with us.\u201d", "The horns sounded again, closer. They were mixed with the dim sounds of a crowd.", "\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d the other demon said. \u201cHe\u2019s in no shape to go running through the city.\u201d", "\u201cHe\u2019s in no shape to stay here,\u201d Encanis snapped. He continued to massage my arms and legs roughly. Some feeling was slowly returning to them, mostly a stinging, prickly heat that was like a painful mockery of the soothing warmth I had felt a minute ago when I was drifting off to sleep. Pain jabbed at me each time he went over a bruise, but my body was too tired to flinch away.", "The green-masked demon came close and laid a hand on her friend\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe have to go now, Gerrek! Someone else will take care of him.\u201d She tried to pull her friend away and met with no success. \u201cIf they find us here with him they\u2019ll assume we did it.\u201d", "The man behind the black mask swore, then nodded and began to rummage around underneath his robe. \u201cDon\u2019t lie down again,\u201d he said to me in urgent tones. \u201cAnd get inside. Somewhere you can warm up.\u201d The crowd sounds were close enough for me to hear individual voices mixed with the noise of horses\u2019 hooves and creaking wooden wheels. The man in the black mask held out his hand.", "It took me a moment to focus on what he held. A silver talent, thicker and heavier than the penny I had lost. So much money I could hardly think of it. \u201cGo on, take it.\u201d", "He was a form of darkness, black hooded cloak, black mask, black gloves. Encanis stood in front of me holding out a bright bit of silver that caught the moonlight. I was reminded of the scene from Daeonica where Tarsus sells his soul.", "I took the talent, but my hand was so numb I couldn\u2019t feel it. I had to look down to make sure my fingers were gripping it. I imagined I could feel warmth radiating up my arm, I felt stronger. I grinned at the man in the black mask.", "\u201cTake my gloves too.\u201d He pulled them off and pushed them against my chest. Then the woman in the green demon mask pulled my benefactor away before I could give him any word of thanks. I watched the two of them go. Their dark robes made them look like pieces of retreating shadow against the charcoal colors of Tarbean\u2019s moonlit streets.", "Not even a minute passed before I saw the pageantry\u2019s torchlight come around the corner toward me. The voices of a hundred men and women singing and shouting crashed over me like waves. I moved away until I felt my back press up against a wall, then I slid weakly sideways until I found a recessed doorway.", "I watched the pageantry from my vantage there. People poured by, shouting and laughing. Tehlu stood tall and proud in the back of a wagon drawn by four white horses. His silver mask gleamed in the torchlight. His white robes were immaculate and lined with fur at the cuff and collar. Grey-robed priests followed along beside the wagon, ringing bells and chanting. Many of them wore the heavy iron chains of penitent priests. The sound of the voices and the bells, the chanting and the chains mingled to make a sort of music. All eyes were for Tehlu. No one saw me standing in the shadows of the doorway.", "It took nearly ten minutes for all of them to pass, only then did I emerge and begin to make my careful way home. It was slow going, but I felt fortified by the coin I held. I checked the talent every dozen steps or so to reassure myself that my numb hand was still gripping it tightly. I wanted to put on the gloves I had been given, but I feared to drop the coin and lose it in the snow.", "I don\u2019t know how long it took for me to get back. The walking warmed me slightly, though my feet still felt wooden and numb. When I looked back over my shoulder, my trail was marked by a smear of blood in every other footprint. It reassured me in an odd way. A foot that bleeds is better than one that is frozen solid.", "I stopped at the first inn I recognized, the Laughing Man. It was full of music, singing, and celebration. I avoided the front door and went around to the back alley. There were a pair of young girls chatting in the kitchen doorway, avoiding their work.", "I limped up to them, using the wall as a crutch. They didn\u2019t notice me until I was nearly on top of them. The younger one looked up at me and gasped.", "I took a step closer. \u201cCould one of you bring me food and a blanket? I can pay.\u201d I held out my hand and was frightened by how much it shook. It was smeared with blood from when I had touched the side of my face. The inside of my mouth felt raw. It hurt to talk. \u201cPlease?\u201d", "They looked at me for a moment in stunned silence. Then they looked at each other and the older of the two motioned the other inside. The young girl disappeared through the door without a word. The older girl, who might have been sixteen, came closer to me and held out her hand.", "I gave her the coin and let my arm fall heavily to my side. She looked at it and disappeared inside after a second long glance at me.", "Through the open doorway I heard the warm, bustling sounds of a busy inn: the low murmur of conversation, punctuated with laughter, the bright clink of bottle glass, and the dull thump of wooden tankards on tabletops.", "And, threading gently through it all, a lute played in the background. It was faint, almost drowned by the other noise, but I heard it the same way a mother can mark her child crying from a dozen rooms away. The music was like a memory of family, of friendship and warm belonging. It made my gut twist and my teeth ache. For a moment my hands stopped aching from the cold, and instead longed for the familiar feel of music running through them.", "I took a slow, shuffling step. Slowly, sliding along the wall, I moved back away from the doorway until I couldn\u2019t hear the music anymore. Then I took another step, until my hands hurt with the cold again and the ache in my chest came from nothing more than broken ribs. They were simpler pains, easier to endure.", "I don\u2019t know how long it was before the two girls came back. The younger one held out a blanket wrapped around something. I hugged it to my aching chest. It seemed disproportionately heavy for its size, but my arms were trembling slightly under their own weight, so it was hard to tell. The older girl held out a small, solid purse. I took it as well, clutching it so tightly my frostburned fingers ached.", "She looked at me. \u201cYou can have a corner by the fire in here if you want it.\u201d", "The younger girl nodded quickly. \u201cNattie won\u2019t mind.\u201d She took a step and reached out to take my arm.", "I jerked away from her, almost falling. \u201cNo!\u201d I meant to shout but it came out as a weak croak, \u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d My voice was shaking, though I couldn\u2019t tell if I was angry or afraid. I staggered away against the wall. My voice was blurry in my ears. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d", "The younger girl started to cry, her hands hanging useless at her sides.", "\u201cI\u2019ve got somewhere to go.\u201d My voice cracked and I turned away. I hurried off as fast as I could. I wasn\u2019t sure what I was running from, unless it was people. That was another lesson I had learned perhaps too well: people meant pain. I heard a few muffled sobs behind me. It seemed a long while before I made it to the corner.", "I made it to my hidden place, where the roofs of two buildings met underneath the overhang of a third. I don\u2019t know how I managed to climb up there.", "Inside the blanket was a whole flask of spiced wine and a loaf of fresh bread nestled next to a turkey breast bigger than both my balled fists. I wrapped myself in the blanket and moved out of the wind as the snow turned to sleet. The brick of the chimney behind me was warm and wonderful.", "The first swallow of wine burned my mouth like fire where it was cut. But the second didn\u2019t sting nearly so much. The bread was soft and the turkey was still warm.", "I woke at midnight when all the bells in the city started ringing. People ran and shouted in the streets. The seven days of High Mourning were behind us. Midwinter was past. A new year had begun.", "", "", ""], "CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE": ["CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE", "The Burning Wheel", "\nI stayed tucked into my secret place all that night and woke late the next day to find my body had stiffened into a tight knot of pain. Since I still had food and a little wine I stayed where I was rather than risk falling when I tried to climb down to the street.", "It was a sunless day with a damp wind that never seemed to stop. Sleet gusted under the protection of the overhanging roof. The chimney was warm behind me, but it wasn\u2019t enough to actually dry out my blanket or drive away the chilly damp that soaked my clothes.", "I finished the wine and the bread early on, and after that I spent most of my time gnawing at the turkey bones and trying to warm up snow in the empty wine flask so I could drink it. Neither proved very productive, and I ended up eating mouthfuls of slushy snow that left me shivering with the taste of tar in my mouth.", "Despite my injuries I dropped off to sleep in the afternoon and woke late at night filled with the most wonderful warmth. I pushed away my blanket and rolled away from the now too-hot chimney only to wake near dawn, shivering and soaked through to the skin. I felt strange, dizzy and fuddled. I huddled back against the chimney and spent the rest of the day drifting in and out of a restless, fevered sleep.", "I have no memory of how I made it off the rooftop, delirious with fever and nearly crippled. I don\u2019t remember making my way the three-quarters of a mile through Tallows and the Crates. I only remember falling down the stairs that led to Trapis\u2019 basement, my purse of money clutched tight in my hand. As I lay there shivering and sweating I heard the faint slapping of his bare feet on the stone.", "\u201cWhat what,\u201d he said gently as he picked me up. \u201cHush hush.\u201d Trapis nursed me through the long days of my fever. He wrapped me in blankets, fed me, and when my fever showed no signs of breaking on its own, he used the money I\u2019d brought to buy a bittersweet medicine. He kept my face and hands wet and cool while murmuring his patient, gentle, \u201cWhat what. Hush hush,\u201d while I cried out from endless fever dreams of my dead parents, the Chandrian, and a man with empty eyes.", "", "I woke clear-headed and cool.", "\u201cOooohreeee,\u201d Tanee said loudly from where he was tied to his cot.", "\u201cWhat what. Hush hush, Tanee.\u201d Trapis said as he put down one of the babies and picked up the other. It looked around owlishly with wide, dark eyes, but seemed unable to support its own head. It was quiet in the room.", "\u201cOoooooohreeee,\u201d Tanee said again.", "I coughed, trying to clear my throat.", "\u201cThere\u2019s a cup on the floor next to you,\u201d Trapis said, brushing a hand along the head of the baby he held.", "\u201cOOOOOH OOHRRRREE EEEEEEHHAA!\u201d Tanee bellowed, strange half-gasps punctuating his cry. The noise agitated several of the others who moved restlessly in their cots. The older boy sitting in the corner raised his hands to the sides of his head and began to moan. He started rocking back and forth, gently at first, but then more and more violently so that when he came forward his head knocked against the bare stone of the wall.", "Trapis was at his side before the boy could do himself any real harm. He put his arms around the rocking boy. \u201cHush hush, Loni. Hush hush.\u201d The boy\u2019s rocking slowed but did not entirely subside. \u201cTanee, you know better than to make all that noise.\u201d His voice was serious, but not stern. \u201cWhy are you making trouble? Loni could hurt himself.\u201d", "\u201cOorrahee,\u201d Tanee said softly. I thought I could detect a note of remorse in his voice.", "\u201cI think he wants a story,\u201d I said, surprising myself by speaking.", "\u201cAaaa,\u201d Tanee said.", "\u201cIs that what you want, Tanee?\u201d", "\u201cAaaa.\u201d", "There was a quiet moment. \u201cI don\u2019t know any stories,\u201d he said.", "Tanee remained stubbornly silent.", "Everyone knows one story, I thought. Everyone knows at least one.", "\u201cOoooooree!\u201d", "Trapis looked around at the quiet room, as if looking for an excuse. \u201cWell,\u201d he said reluctantly. \u201cIt has been a while since we had a story, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d He looked down at the boy in his arms. \u201cWould you like a story, Loni?\u201d", "Loni nodded a violent affirmation, nearly battering Trapis\u2019 cheek with the back of his head.", "\u201cWill you be good and sit by yourself, so I can tell a story?\u201d", "Loni stopped rocking almost immediately. Trapis slowly unwrapped his arms and stepped away. After a long look to make sure the boy wouldn\u2019t hurt himself, he stepped carefully back to his chair.", "\u201cWell,\u201d he muttered softly to himself as he stooped to pick up the baby he had set aside. \u201cDo I have a story?\u201d He spoke very quietly to the child\u2019s wide eyes. \u201cNo. No, I don\u2019t. Can I remember one? I suppose I had better.\u201d", "He sat for a long moment, humming to the child in his arms, a thoughtful expression on his face. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d He sat up taller in his chair. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d", "", "This is a story from long ago. Back before any of us were born. Before our fathers were born, too. It was a long time ago. Maybe\u2014maybe four hundred years. No, more than that. Probably a thousand years. But maybe not quite as much as that.", "It was a bad time in the world. People were hungry and sick. There were famines and great plagues. There were many wars and other bad things in this time, because there was no one to stop them.", "But the worst thing in this time was that there were demons walking the land. Some of them were small and troublesome, creatures who lamed horses and spoiled milk. But there were many worse than those.", "There were demons who hid in men\u2019s bodies and made them sick or mad, but those were not the worst. There were demons like great beasts that would catch and eat men while they were still alive and screaming, but they were not the worst. Some demons stole the skins of men and wore them like clothes, but even they were not the worst.", "There was one demon that stood above the others. Encanis, the swallowing darkness. No matter where he walked, shadows hid his face, and scorpions that stung him died of the corruption they had touched.", "Now Tehlu, who made the world and who is lord over all, watched the world of men. He saw that demons made sport of us and killed us and ate our bodies. Some men he saved, but only a few. For Tehlu is just and saves only the worthy, and in these times few men acted even for their own good, let alone the good of others.", "Because of this, Tehlu was unhappy. For he had made the world to be a good place for men to live. But his church was corrupt. They stole from the poor and did not live by the laws he had given....", "No, wait. There was no church yet, and no priests either. Just men and women, and some of them knew who Tehlu was. But even those were wicked, so when they called on Lord Tehlu for help he felt no desire to aid them.", "But after years of watching and waiting, Tehlu saw a woman pure of heart and spirit. Her name was Perial. Her mother had raised her to know Tehlu, and she worshiped him as well as her poor circumstances allowed. Although her own life was hard, Perial prayed only for others, and never for herself.", "Tehlu watched her for long years. He saw her life was hard, full of misfortune and torment at the hands of demons and bad men. But she never cursed his name or ceased her praying, and she never treated any person other than with kindness and respect.", "So late one night, Tehlu went to her in a dream. He stood before her, and seemed to be made entirely of fire or sunlight. He came to her in splendor and asked her if she knew who he was.", "\u201cSure enough,\u201d she said. You see, she was very calm about it because she thought she was just having an odd dream. \u201cYou\u2019re Lord Tehlu.\u201d", "He nodded and asked her if she knew why he had come to her.", "\u201cAre you going to do something for my neighbor Deborah?\u201d she asked. Because that\u2019s who she had prayed for before she went to sleep. \u201cAre you going to lay your hand on her husband Losel and make him a better man? The way he treats her isn\u2019t right. Man should never lay a hand on woman, save in love.\u201d", "Tehlu knew her neighbors. He knew they were wicked people who had done wicked things. Everyone in the village was wicked but her. Everyone in the world was. He told her so.", "\u201cDeborah has been very kind and good to me,\u201d Perial said. \u201cAnd even Losel, who I don\u2019t care for, is one of my neighbors all the same.\u201d", "Tehlu told her that Deborah spent time in many different men\u2019s beds, and Losel drank every day of the week, even on Mourning. No, wait\u2014there wasn\u2019t any Mourning yet. But he drank a lot at any rate. Sometimes he grew so angry that he beat his wife until she could not stand or even cry aloud.", "Perial was quiet for a long moment in her dream. She knew Tehlu spoke the truth, but while Perial was pure of heart, she was not a fool. She had suspected her neighbors of doing the things Tehlu said. Even now that she knew for certain, she cared for her neighbors all the same. \u201cYou won\u2019t help her?\u201d", "Tehlu said that the man and wife were each other\u2019s fitting punishment. They were wicked and the wicked should be punished.", "Perial spoke out honestly, perhaps because she thought she was dreaming, but perhaps she would have said the same thing had she been awake, for Perial said what was in her heart. \u201cIt\u2019s not their fault that the world is full of hard choices and hunger and loneliness,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat can you expect of people when demons are their neighbors?\u201d", "But though Tehlu listened to her wise words with his ears, he told her that mankind was wicked, and the wicked should be punished.", "\u201cI think you know very little about what it is to be a man,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I would still help them if I could,\u201d she told him resolutely.", "SO YOU SHALL, Tehlu told her, and reached out to lay his hand on her heart. When he touched her she felt like she were a great golden bell that had just rung out its first note. She opened her eyes and knew then that it had been no normal dream.", "Thus it was that she was not surprised to discover she was pregnant. In three months she gave birth to a perfect dark-eyed baby boy. She named him Menda. The day after he was born, Menda could crawl. In two days he could walk. Perial was surprised, but not worried, for she knew the child was a gift from God.", "Nevertheless, Perial was wise. She knew that people might not understand. So she kept Menda close by her, and when her friends and neighbors came to visit, she sent them away.", "But this could only last a little while, for in a small town there are no secrets. Folk knew that Perial was not married. And while children born out of wedlock were common during this time, children who grew to manhood in less than two months were not. They were afraid that she might have lain down with a demon, and that her child was a demon\u2019s child. Such things were not unheard of in those dark times, and the people were afraid.", "So everyone gathered together on the first day of the seventh span, and made their way to the tiny house where Perial lived by herself with her son. The town smith, whose name was Rengen, led them. \u201cShow us the boy,\u201d he yelled. But there was no response from the house. \u201cBring out the boy, and show us he is nothing but a human child.\u201d", "The house remained quiet, and though there were many men among them, no one wanted to enter a house that might have a demon\u2019s child inside. So the smith cried out again, \u201cPerial, bring out young Menda, or we will burn your house around you.\u201d", "The door opened, and a man stepped out. None of them recognized who it was, because even though he was only seven span from the womb, Menda looked to be a young man of seventeen. He stood proud and tall, with coal-black hair and eyes. \u201cI am the one you think is Menda,\u201d he said in a voice both powerful and deep. \u201cWhat do you want of me?\u201d", "The sound of his voice made Perial gasp inside the cottage. Not only was this the first time Menda had ever spoken, but she recognized his voice as the same one that had spoken to her in a dream, months ago.", "\u201cWhat do you mean, we think you are Menda?\u201d asked the smith, gripping his hammer tightly. He knew that there were demons that looked like men, or wore their skins like costumes, the way a man might hide beneath a sheepskin.", "The child who was not a child spoke again. \u201cI am Perial\u2019s son, but I am not Menda. And I am not a demon.\u201d", "\u201cTouch the iron of my hammer then,\u201d said Rengen, for he knew all demons feared two things, cold iron and clean fire. He held out his heavy forge hammer. It shook in his hands, but no one thought the less of him for it.", "He who was not Menda stepped forward and lay both hands on the iron head of the hammer. Nothing happened. From the doorway of her house where she watched, Perial burst into tears, for though she trusted Tehlu, some part of her had held a mother\u2019s worry for her son.", "\u201cI am not Menda, though that is what my mother called me. I am Tehlu, lord above all. I have come to free you from demons and the wickedness of your own hearts. I am Tehlu, son of myself. Let the wicked hear my voice and tremble.\u201d", "And they did tremble. But some of them refused to believe. They called him a demon and threatened him. They spoke hard, frightened words. Some threw stones and cursed him, and spat toward him and his mother.", "Then Tehlu grew angry, and he might have slain them all, but Perial leaped forward and laid a restraining hand on his shoulder. \u201cWhat more can you expect?\u201d she asked him quietly. \u201cFrom men who live with demons for their neighbors? Even the best dog will bite that has been kicked enough.\u201d", "Tehlu considered her words and saw that she was wise. So he looked over his hands at Rengen, looked deep into his heart and said, \u201cRengen, son of Engen, you have a mistress who you pay to lie with you. Some men come to you for work and you cheat or steal from them. And though you pray loudly, you do not believe I, Tehlu, made the world and watch over all who live here.\u201d", "When Rengen heard this, he grew pale and dropped his hammer to the ground. For what Tehlu said to him was true. Tehlu looked at all the men and women there. He looked into their hearts and spoke of what he saw. All of them were wicked, so much that Rengen was among the best of them.", "Then Tehlu drew a line in the dirt of the road so that it lay between himself and all those who had come. \u201cThis road is like the meandering course of a life. There are two paths to take, side by side. Each of you are already traveling that side. You must choose. Stay on your own path, or cross to mine.\u201d", "\u201cBut the road is the same, isn\u2019t it? It still goes to the same place,\u201d someone asked.", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "\u201cWhere does the road lead?\u201d", "\u201cDeath. All lives end in death, excepting one. Such is the way of things.\u201d", "\u201cThen what does it matter which side a man is on?\u201d It was Rengen asking these questions. He was a large man, one of the few that was taller than dark-eyed Tehlu. But he was shaken by all that he had seen and heard in the past few hours. \u201cWhat is on our side of the road?\u201d", "\u201cPain,\u201d Tehlu said in a voice as hard and cold as stone. \u201cPunishment.\u201d", "\u201cAnd your side?\u201d", "\u201cPain now,\u201d Tehlu said in the same voice. \u201cPunishment now, for all that you have done. It cannot be avoided. But I am here too, this is my path.\u201d", "\u201cHow do I cross?\u201d", "\u201cRegret, repent, and cross to me.\u201d", "Rengen stepped over the line to stand beside his God. Then Tehlu bent to pick up the hammer that the smith had dropped. But instead of giving it back, he struck Rengen with it as if it were a lash. Once. Twice. Thrice. And the third blow sent Rengen to his knees sobbing and crying out in pain. But after the third blow, Tehlu laid the hammer aside and knelt to look Rengen in the face. \u201cYou were the first to cross,\u201d he said softly so only the smith could hear. \u201cIt was a brave thing, a hard thing to do. I am proud of you. You are no longer Rengen, now you are Wereth, the forger of the path.\u201d Then", "Tehlu embraced him with both arms, and his touch took much of the pain from Rengen who was now Wereth. But not all, for Tehlu spoke truly when he said that punishment cannot be avoided.", "One by one they crossed, and one by one Tehlu struck them down with the hammer. But after each man or woman fell, Tehlu knelt and spoke to them, giving them new names and healing some of their hurt.", "Many of the men and women had demons hiding inside them that fled screaming when the hammer touched them. These people Tehlu spoke with a while longer, but he always embraced them in the end, and they were all grateful. Some of them danced for the joy of being free of such terrible things living inside them.", "In the end, seven stayed on the other side of the line. Tehlu asked them three times if they would cross, and three times they refused. After the third asking Tehlu sprang across the line and he struck each of them a great blow, driving them to the ground.", "But not all were men. When Tehlu struck the fourth, there was the sound of quenching iron and the smell of burning leather. For the fourth man had not been a man at all, but a demon wearing a man\u2019s skin. When it was revealed, Tehlu grabbed the demon and broke it in his hands, cursing its name and sending it back to the outer darkness that is the home of its kind.", "The remaining three let themselves be struck down. None of them were demons, though demons fled the bodies of some who fell. After he was done, Tehlu did not speak to the six who did not cross, nor did he kneel to embrace them and ease their wounds.", "The next day, Tehlu set off to finish what he had begun. He walked from town to town, offering each village he met the same choice he had given before. Always the results were the same, some crossed, some stayed, some were not men at all but demons, and those he destroyed.", "But there was one demon who eluded Tehlu. Encanis, whose face was all in shadow. Encanis, whose voice was like a knife in the minds of men.", "Wherever Tehlu stopped to offer men the choice of path, Encanis had been there just before, killing crops and poisoning wells. Encanis, setting men to murder one another and stealing children from their beds at night.", "At the end of seven years, Tehlu\u2019s feet had carried him all through the world. He had driven out the demons that plagued us. All but one. Encanis ran free and did the work of a thousand demons, destroying and despoiling wherever he went.", "So Tehlu chased and Encanis fled. Soon Tehlu was a span of days behind the demon, then two days, then half a day. Finally he was so close he felt the chill of Encanis\u2019 passing and could spy places where he had set his hands and feet, for they were marked with a cold, black frost.", "Knowing he was pursued, Encanis came to a great city. The Lord of Demons called forth his power and the city was brought to ruin. He did this hoping Tehlu would delay so he could make his escape, but the Walking God paused only to appoint priests who cared for the people of the ruined town.", "For six days Encanis fled, and six great cities he destroyed. But on the seventh day, Tehlu drew near before Encanis could bring his power to bear and the seventh city was saved. That is why seven is a lucky number, and why we celebrate on Caenin.", "Encanis was now hard pressed and bent his whole thought upon escape. But on the eighth day Tehlu did not pause to sleep or eat. And thus it was that at the end of Felling Tehlu caught Encanis. He leaped on the demon and struck him with his forge hammer. Encanis fell like a stone, but Tehlu\u2019s hammer shattered and lay in the dust of the road.", "Tehlu carried the demon\u2019s limp body all through the long night, and on the morning of the ninth day he came to the city of Atur. When men saw Tehlu carrying the demon\u2019s senseless form, they thought Encanis dead. But Tehlu knew that such a thing was not easily done. No simple blade or blow could kill him. No cell of bars could keep him safe within.", "So Tehlu carried Encanis to the smithy. He called for iron, and people brought all they owned. Though he had taken no rest nor a morsel of food, all through the ninth day Tehlu labored. While ten men worked the bellows, Tehlu forged the great iron wheel.", "All night he worked, and when the first light of the tenth morning touched him, Tehlu struck the wheel one final time and it was finished. Wrought all of black iron, the wheel stood taller than a man. It had six spokes, each thicker than a hammer\u2019s haft, and its rim was a handspan across. It weighed as much as forty men, and was cold to the touch. The sound of its name was terrible, and none could speak it.", "Tehlu gathered the people who were watching and chose a priest among them. Then he set them to dig a great pit in the center of the town, fifteen feet wide and twenty feet deep.", "With the sun rising Tehlu laid the body of the demon on the wheel. At the first touch of iron, Encanis began to stir in his sleep. But Tehlu chained him tightly to the wheel, hammering the links together, sealing them tighter than any lock.", "Then Tehlu stepped back, and all saw Encanis shift again, as if disturbed by an unpleasant dream. Then he shook and came awake entirely. Encanis strained against the chains, his body arching upward as he pulled against them. Where the iron touched his skin it felt like knives and needles and nails, like the searing pain of frost, like the sting of a hundred biting flies. Encanis thrashed on the wheel and began to howl as the iron burned and bit and froze him.", "To Tehlu the sound was like a sweet music. He lay down on the ground beside the wheel and slept a deep sleep, for he was very tired.", "When he awoke, it was evening of the tenth day. Encanis was still bound to the wheel, but he no longer howled and fought like a trapped animal. Tehlu bent and with great effort lifted one edge of the wheel and set it leaning against a tree that grew nearby. As soon as he came close, Encanis cursed him in languages no one knew, scratching and biting.", "\u201cYou brought this on yourself,\u201d Tehlu said.", "That night there was a celebration. Tehlu sent men to cut a dozen evergreens and use them to kindle a bonfire in the bottom of the deep pit they had dug.", "All night the townsfolk danced and sang around the burning fire. They knew the last and most dangerous of the world\u2019s demons was finally caught.", "And all night Encanis hung from his wheel and watched them, motionless as a snake.", "When the morning of the eleventh day came, Tehlu went to Encanis a third and final time. The demon looked worn and feral. His skin was sallow and his bones pressed tight against his skin. But his power still lay around him like a dark mantle, hiding his face in shadow.", "\u201cEncanis,\u201d Tehlu said. \u201cThis is your last chance to speak. Do it, for I know it is within your power.\u201d", "\u201cLord Tehlu, I am not Encanis.\u201d For that brief moment the demon\u2019s voice was pitiful, and all who heard it were moved to sorrow. But then there was a sound like quenching iron, and the wheel rung like an iron bell. Encanis\u2019 body arched painfully at the sound then hung limply from his wrists as the ringing of the wheel faded.", "\u201cTry no tricks, dark one. Speak no lies,\u201d Tehlu said sternly, his eyes as dark and hard as the iron of the wheel.", "\u201cWhat then?\u201d Encanis hissed, his voice like the rasp of stone on stone. \u201cWhat? Rack and shatter you, what do you want of me?\u201d", "\u201cYour road is very short, Encanis. But you may still choose a side on which to travel.\u201d", "Encanis laughed. \u201cYou will give me the same choice you give the cattle? Yes then, I will cross to your side of the path, I regret and rep\u2014\u201d", "The wheel rung again, like a great bell tolling long and deep. Encanis threw his body tight against the chains again and the sound of his scream shook the earth and shattered stones for half a mile in each direction.", "When the sounds of wheel and scream had faded, Encanis hung panting and shaking from his chains. \u201cI told you to speak no lie, Encanis,\u201dTehlu said, pitiless.", "\u201cMy path then!\u201d Encanis shrieked. \u201cI do not regret! If I had my choice again, I would only change how fast I ran. Your people are like cattle my kind feed on! Bite and break you, if you gave me half an hour I would do such things that these wretched gawping peasants would go mad with fear. I would drink their children\u2019s blood and bathe in women\u2019s tears.\u201d He might have said more, but his breath was short as he strained against the chains that held him.", "\u201cSo,\u201dTehlu said, and stepped close to the wheel. For a moment it seemed like he would embrace Encanis, but he was merely reaching for the iron spokes of the wheel. Then, straining, Tehlu lifted the wheel above his head. He carried it, arms upstretched, toward the pit, and threw Encanis in.", "Through the long hours of night, a dozen evergreens had fed the fire. The flames had died in the early morning, leaving a deep bed of sullen coals that glimmered when the wind brushed them.", "The wheel struck flat, with Encanis on top. There was an explosion of spark and ash as it landed and sank inches deep into the hot coals. Encanis was held over the coals by the iron that bound and burned and bit at him.", "Though he was held away from the fire itself, the heat was so intense that Encanis\u2019 clothes charred black and began to crumble without bursting into flame. The demon thrashed against his bonds, settling the wheel more firmly into the coals. Encanis screamed, because he knew that even demons can die from fire or iron. And though he was powerful, he was bound and burning. He felt the metal of the wheel grow hot beneath him, blackening the flesh of his arms and legs. Encanis screamed, and even as his skin began to smoke and char, his face was still hidden in a shadow that rose from him like a tongue of darkening flame.", "Then Encanis grew silent, and the only sound was the hiss of sweat and blood as they fell from the demon\u2019s straining limbs. For a long moment everything was still. Encanis strained against the chains that held him to the wheel, and it seemed that he would strain until his muscles tore themselves from bone and sinew both.", "Then there was a sharp sound like a bell breaking and the demon\u2019s arm jerked free of the wheel. Links of chain, now glowing red from the heat of the fire, flew upward to land smoking at the feet of those who stood above. The only sound was the sudden, wild laughter of Encanis, like breaking glass.", "In a moment the demon\u2019s second hand was free, but before he could do more, Tehlu flung himself into the pit and landed with such force that the iron rang with it. Tehlu grabbed the hands of the demon and pressed them back against the wheel.", "Encanis screamed in fury and in disbelief, for though he was forced back onto the burning wheel, and though he felt the strength of Tehlu was greater than chains he had broken, he saw Tehlu was burning in the flames.", "\u201cFool!\u201d he wailed. \u201cYou will die here with me. Let me go and live. Let me go and I will trouble you no further.\u201d And the wheel did not ring out, for Encanis was truly frightened.", "\u201cNo,\u201d said Tehlu. \u201cYour punishment is death. You will serve it.\u201d", "\u201cFool! Madling!\u201d Encanis thrashed to no avail. \u201cYou are burning in the flames with me, you will die as I do!\u201d", "\u201cTo ash all things return, so too this flesh will burn. But I am Tehlu. Son of myself. Father of myself. I was before, and I will be after. If I am a sacrifice then it is to myself alone. And if I am needed and called in the proper ways then I will come again to judge and punish.\u201d", "So Tehlu held him to the burning wheel, and none of the demon\u2019s threats or screaming moved him the least part of an inch. So it was that Encanis passed from the world, and with him went Tehlu who was Menda. Both of them burned to ash in the pit in Atur. That is why the Tehlin priests wear robes of ashen grey. And that is how we know Tehlu cares for us, and watches us, and keeps us safe from\u2014", "", "Trapis broke off his story as Jaspin began to howl and thrash against his restraints. I slid softly back into unconsciousness as soon as I no longer had the story to hold my attention.", "After that, I began to harbor a suspicion that never entirely left me. Was Trapis a Tehlin priest? His robe was tattered and dirty, but it might have been the proper grey long ago. Parts of his story had been awkward and stumbling, but some were stately and grand, as if he had been reciting them from some half-forgotten memory. Of sermons? Of his readings from the Book of the Path?", "I never asked.

It was a very practical application of acting with a very difficult audience. I did it well, but Waterside money was tight and an empty begging bowl meant a cold, hungry night.", "Through dangerous trial and error I discovered the proper way to slit a purse and pick a pocket. I was especially good at the latter. Locks and latches of all kinds soon gave up their secrets to me. My nimble fingers were put to a use my parents or Abenthy never would have guessed.", "I learned to run from anyone with an unnaturally white smile. Denner resin slowly bleaches your teeth, so if a sweet-eater lives long enough for their teeth to grow fully white, chances are they have already sold everything they have worth selling. Tarbean is full of dangerous people, but none as dangerous as a sweet-eater filled with the desperate craving for more resin. They will kill you for a pair of pennies.", "I learned how to lash together makeshift shoes out of rags. Real shoes became a thing of dreams for me. The first two years it seemed like my feet were always cold, or cut, or both. But by the third year my feet were like old leather and I could run barefoot for hours over the rough stones of the city and not feel it at all.", "I learned not to expect help from anyone. In the bad parts of Tarbean a call for help attracts predators like the smell of blood on the wind.", "", "I was sleeping on the rooftops, snugged tightly into my secret place where three roofs met. I awoke from a deep sleep to the sound of harsh laughter and pounding feet in the alley below me.", "The slapping footsteps stopped and more laughter followed the sound of ripping cloth. Slipping to the edge of the roof, I looked down to the alley below. I saw several large boys, almost men. They were dressed as I was, rags and dirt. There may have been five, maybe six of them. They moved in and out of the shadows like shadows themselves. Their chests heaved from their run and I could hear their breath from the roof above.", "The object of the chase was in the middle of the alley: a young boy, eight years old at the most. One of the older boys was holding him down. The young boy\u2019s bare skin shone pale in the moonlight. There was another sound of ripping cloth, and the boy gave a soft cry that ended in a choked sob.", "The others watched and talked in low urgent tones with each other, wearing hard, hungry smiles.", "I\u2019d been chased before at night, several times. I\u2019d been caught too, months ago. Looking down, I was surprised to find a heavy red roof tile in my hand, ready to throw.", "Then I paused, looking back to my secret place. I had a rag blanket and a half a loaf of bread there. My rainy-day money was hidden here, eight iron pennies I had hoarded for when my luck turned bad. And most valuable of all, Ben\u2019s book. I was safe here. Even if I hit one of them, the rest would be on the roof in two minutes. Then, even if I got away, I wouldn\u2019t have anywhere to go.", "I set down the tile.

Emotions by their very nature are not reasonable things. I don\u2019t feel that way now, but back then I did. I remember.\u201d He turned back to the fire. \u201cBen\u2019s training has given me a memory so clean and sharp I have to be careful not to cut myself sometimes.\u201d", "Kvothe took a mulling stone from the fire and dropped it into his wooden mug. It sank with a sharp hiss. The smell of searing clove and nutmeg filled the room.", "Kvothe stirred his cider with a long-handled spoon as he made his way back to the table. \u201cYou must also remember that I was not in my right mind. Much of me was still in shock, sleeping if you will. I needed something, or someone, to wake me up.\u201d", "He nodded to Chronicler, who casually shook his writing hand to loosen it, then unstoppered his inkwell.", "Kvothe leaned back in his seat. \u201cI needed to be reminded of things I had forgotten. I needed a reason to leave. It was years before I met someone who could do those things.\u201d He smiled at Chronicler. \u201cBefore I met Skarpi.\u201d", "", "", ""], "CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX": ["CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX", "Lanre Turned", "\nI had been in Tarbean for years at this point. Three birthdays had slipped by unnoticed and I was just past fifteen. I knew how to survive Waterside. I had become an accomplished beggar and thief. Locks and pockets opened to my touch. I knew which pawnshops bought goods \u201cfrom uncle\u201d with no questions asked.", "I was still ragged and frequently hungry, but I was in no real danger of starving. I had been slowly building my rainy-day money. Even after a hard winter that had frequently forced me to pay for a warm spot to sleep, my hoard was over twenty iron pennies. It was like a dragon\u2019s treasure to me.", "I had grown comfortable there. But aside from the desire to add to my rainy-day money I had nothing to live for. Nothing driving me. Nothing to look forward to. My days were spent looking for things to steal and ways to entertain myself", "But that had changed a few days earlier in Trapis\u2019 basement. I had heard a young girl speaking in an awed voice about a storyteller who spent all his time in a Dockside bar called the Half-Mast. Apparently, every sixth bell he told a story. Any story you asked for, he knew. What\u2019s more, she said that he had a bet going. If he didn\u2019t know your story, he would give you a whole talent.", "I thought about what the girl had said for the rest of the day. I doubted it was true, but I couldn\u2019t help thinking about what I could do with a whole silver talent. I could buy shoes, and maybe a knife, give money to Trapis, and still double my rainy-day fund.", "Even if the girl was lying about the bet, I was still interested. Entertainment was hard to come by on the streets. Occasionally some ragamuffin troupe would mum a play on a street corner or I\u2019d hear a fiddler in a pub. But most real entertainment cost money, and my hard-won pennies were too precious to squander.", "But there was a problem. Dockside wasn\u2019t safe for me.", "I should explain. More than a year before, I had seen Pike walking down the street. It had been the first time I\u2019d seen him since my first day in Tar-bean when he and his friends had jumped me in that alley and destroyed my father\u2019s lute.", "I followed him carefully for the better part of a day, keeping my distance and staying in the shadows. Eventually he went home to a little box alley Dockside where he had his own version of my secret place. His was a nest of broken crates he had cobbled together to keep the weather off.", "I perched on the roof all night, waiting until he left the next morning. Then I made my way down to his nest of crates and looked around. It was cozy, filled with the accumulated small possessions of several years. He had a bottle of beer, which I drank. There was also half a cheese that I ate, and a shirt that I stole, as it was slightly less raggedy than my own.", "Further searching revealed various odds and ends, a candle, a ball of string, some marbles. Most surprising were several pieces of sailcloth with charcoal drawings of a woman\u2019s face. I had to search for nearly ten minutes until I found what I was really looking for. Hidden away behind everything else was a small wooden box that showed signs of much handling. It held a bundle of dried violets tied with a white ribbon, a toy horse that had lost most of its string mane, and a lock of curling blond hair.", "It took me several minutes with flint and steel to get the fire going. The violets were good tinder and soon greasy clouds of smoke were billowing high into the air. I stood by and watched as everything Pike loved went up in flames.", "But I stayed too long, savoring the moment. Pike and a friend came running down the box alley, drawn by the smoke, and I was trapped. Furious, Pike jumped me. He was taller by six inches and outweighed me by fifty pounds. Worse, he had a piece of broken glass wrapped with twine at one end, making a crude knife.", "He stabbed me once in the thigh right above my knee before I smashed his hand into the cobblestones, shattering the knife. After that he still gave me a black eye and several broken ribs before I managed to kick him squarely between the legs and get free. As I pelted away he limped after me, shouting that he would kill me for what I\u2019d done.", "I believed him. After patching up my leg, I took every bit of rainy-day money I had saved and bought five pints of dreg, a cheap, foul liquor strong enough to blister the inside of your mouth. Then I limped into Dockside and waited for Pike and his friends to spot me.", "It didn\u2019t take long, I let him and two of his friends follow me for half a mile, past Seamling Lane and into Tallows. I kept to the main roads, knowing they wouldn\u2019t dare attack me in broad daylight when people were around.", "But when I darted into a side alley, they hurried to catch up, suspecting I was trying to make a run for it. However, when they turned the corner no one was there.", "Pike thought to look up just as I was pouring the bucket of dreg onto him from the edge of the low roof above. It doused him, splashing across his face and chest. He screamed and clutched at his eyes as he went to his knees. Then I struck the phosphorus match I\u2019d stolen, and dropped it onto him, watching it sputter and flare as it fell.", "Full of the pure, hard hatred of a child, I hoped he would burst into a pillar of flame. He didn\u2019t, but did catch fire. He screamed again and staggered around while his friends swatted at him, trying to put him out. I left while they were busy.", "It had been over a year ago and I hadn\u2019t seen Pike since. He hadn\u2019t tried to find me, and I had stayed well clear of Dockside, sometimes going miles out of my way rather than pass near it. It was a kind of truce. However, I didn\u2019t doubt that Pike and his friends remembered what I looked like, and were willing to settle the score if they spotted me.", "After thinking it over, I decided it was too dangerous. Even the promise of free stories and a chance at a silver talent wasn\u2019t worth stirring things up with Pike again. Besides, what story would I ask for?", "The question rolled around in my head for the next few days. What story would I ask for? I jostled up against a dockworker and was cuffed away before I could get my hand all the way into his pocket. What story? I begged on the street corner opposite the Tehlin church. What story? I stole three loaves of bread and took two of them down to Trapis as a gift. What story?", "Then, as I lay on the rooftops in my secret place where three roofs met, it came to me just as I was about to drift off to sleep. Lanre. Of course. I could ask him for the real story of Lanre. The story my father had been....", "My heart stuttered in my chest as I suddenly remembered things I had avoided for years: my father idly strumming at his lute, my mother beside him in the wagon, singing. Reflexively, I began to draw away from the memories, the way you might pull your hand back from a fire.", "But I was surprised to find these memories held only a gentle ache, not the deep pain I expected. Instead I found a small, budding excitement at the thought of hearing a story my father would have sought out. A story he himself might have told.", "Still, I knew it to be sheer folly to go running Dockside for the sake of a story. All the hard practicality Tarbean had taught me over the years urged me to stay in my familiar corner of the world, where I was safe....", "", "The first thing I saw on entering the Half-Mast was Skarpi. He was sitting on a tall stool at the bar, an old man with eyes like diamonds and the body of a driftwood scarecrow. He was thin and weathered with thick white hair on his arms and face and head. The whiteness of it stood out from his deep brown tan, making him seem splashed with wave foam.", "At his feet were a group of twenty children, some few my age, most younger. They were a strange mix to see, ranging from grubby, shoeless urchins like myself, to reasonably well-dressed, well-scrubbed children who probably had parents and homes.", "None of them looked familiar to me, but I never knew who might be a friend of Pike\u2019s. I found a place near the door with my back to the wall and sank down onto my haunches.", "Skarpi cleared his throat once or twice in a way that made me thirsty. Then, with ritual significance, he looked mournfully into the clay mug that sat in front of him and carefully turned it upside down on the bar.", "The children surged forward, pressing coins onto the bar. I did a quick count: two iron halfpennies, nine shims, and a drab. Altogether, just a little over three iron pennies in Commonwealth coin. Maybe he was no longer offering the silver talent bet. More likely the rumor I\u2019d heard was wrong.", "The old man nodded almost imperceptibility to the bartender. \u201cFallows Red.\u201d His voice was deep and rough, almost hypnotic. The bald man behind the bar gathered up the coins and deftly poured wine into Skarpi\u2019s wide clay cup.", "\u201cSo, what would everyone like to hear about today?\u201d Skarpi rumbled. His deep voice rolling out like distant thunder.", "There was a moment of silence that again struck me as ritualistic, almost reverent. Then a babble burst forth from all the children at once.", "\u201cI want a faerie story!\u201d", "\u201c... Oren and the fight at Mnat\u2019s ...\u201d", "\u201cYes, Oren Velciter! The one with Baron ...\u201d", "\u201cLartam ...\u201d", "\u201cMyr Tariniel!\u201d", "\u201cIllien and the Bear!\u201d", "\u201cLanre,\u201d I said, almost without meaning to.", "The room went still again as Skarpi took a drink. The children watched him with a familiar intensity I couldn\u2019t quite identify.", "Skarpi sat calmly in the middle of the quiet. \u201cDid I,\u201d his voice rolled out slowly, like dark honey, \u201chear someone say Lanre?\u201d He looked directly at me, his blue eyes clear and sharp.", "I nodded, not knowing what to expect.", "\u201cI want to hear about the dry lands over the Stormwal,\u201d one of the younger girls complained. \u201cAbout the sand snakes that come out of the ground like sharks. And the dry men who hide under the dunes and drink your blood instead of water. And\u2014\u201d She was cuffed quickly into silence from a dozen different directions by the children surrounding her.", "Silence fell sharply as Skarpi took another drink. Watching the children as they watched Skarpi, I realized what they reminded me of: a person anxiously watching a clock. I guessed that when the old man\u2019s drink was gone, the story he told would be over as well.", "Skarpi took another drink, no more than a sip this time, then set his cup down and pivoted on his stool to face us. \u201cWho would like to hear the story of a man who lost his eye and gained a better sight?\u201d", "Something about the tone of his voice or the reaction of the other children told me this was a purely rhetorical question. \u201cSo, Lanre and the Creation War. An old, old story.\u201d His eyes swept over the children. \u201cSit and listen for I will speak of the shining city as it once was, years and miles away....\u201d", "", "Once, years and miles away, there was Myr Tariniel. The shining city. It sat among the tall mountains of the world like a gem on the crown of a king. Imagine a city as large as Tarbean, but on every corner of every street there was a bright fountain, or a green tree growing, or a statue so beautiful it would make a proud man cry to look at it. The buildings were tall and graceful, carved from the mountain itself, carved of a bright white stone that held the sun\u2019s light long after evening fell.", "Selitos was lord over Myr Tariniel. Just by looking at a thing Selitos could see its hidden name and understand it. In those days there were many who could do such things, but Selitos was the most powerful namer of anyone alive in that age.", "Selitos was well loved by the people he protected. His judgments were strict and fair, and none could sway him through falsehood or dissembling. Such was the power of his sight that he could read the hearts of men like heavy-lettered books.", "Now in those days there was a terrible war being fought across a vast empire. The war was called the Creation War, and the empire was called Ergen. And despite the fact that the world has never seen an empire as grand or a war so terrible, both of them only live in stories now. Even history books that mentioned them as doubtful rumor have long since crumbled into dust.", "The war had lasted so long that folk could hardly remember a time when the sky wasn\u2019t dark with the smoke of burning towns. Once there had been hundreds of proud cities scattered through the empire. Now there were merely ruins littered with the bodies of the dead. Famine and plague were everywhere, and in some places there was such despair that mothers could no longer muster enough hope to give their children names. But eight cities remained. They were Belen, Antus,Vaeret, Tinusa, Emlen, and the twin cities of Murilla and Murella. Last was Myr Tariniel, greatest of them all and the only one unscarred by the long centuries of war. It was protected by the mountains and brave soldiers. But the true cause of Myr Tariniel\u2019s peace was Selitos. Using the power of his sight he kept watch over the mountain passes leading to his beloved city. His rooms were in the city\u2019s highest towers so he could see any attack long before it came to be a threat.", "The other seven cities, lacking Selitos\u2019 power, found their safety elsewhere. They put their trust in thick walls, in stone and steel. They put their trust in strength of arm, in valor and bravery and blood. And so they put their trust in Lanre.", "Lanre had fought since he could lift a sword, and by the time his voice began to crack he was the equal of a dozen older men. He married a woman named Lyra, and his love for her was a passion fiercer than fury.", "Lyra was terrible and wise, and held a power just as great as his. For while Lanre had the strength of his arm and the command of loyal men, Lyra knew the names of things, and the power of her voice could kill a man or still a thunderstorm.", "As the years passed, Lanre and Lyra fought side by side. They defended Belen from a surprise attack, saving the city from a foe that should have overwhelmed them. They gathered armies and made the cities recognize the need for allegiance. Over the long years they pressed the empire\u2019s enemies back. People who had grown numb with despair began to feel warm hope kindling inside. They hoped for peace, and they hung those flickering hopes on Lanre.", "Then came the Blac of Drossen Tor. Blac meant \u2018battle\u2019 in the language of the time, and at Drossen Tor there was the largest and most terrible battle of this large and terrible war. They fought unceasing for three days in the light of the sun, and for three nights unceasing by the light of the moon. Neither side could defeat the other, and both were unwilling to retreat.", "Of the battle itself I have only one thing to say. More people died at Drossen Tor than there are living in the world today.", "Lanre was always where the fight was thickest, where he was needed most. His sword never left his hand or rested in its sheath. At the very end of things, covered in blood amid a field of corpses, Lanre stood alone against a terrible foe. It was a great beast with scales of black iron, whose breath was a darkness that smothered men. Lanre fought the beast and killed it. Lanre brought victory to his side, but he bought it with his life.", "After the battle was finished and the enemy was set beyond the doors of stone, survivors found Lanre\u2019s body, cold and lifeless near the beast he had slain. Word of Lanre\u2019s death spread quickly, covering the field like a blanket of despair. They had won the battle and turned the tide of the war, but each of them felt cold inside. The small flame of hope that each of them cherished began to flicker and fade. Their hopes had hung on Lanre, and Lanre was dead.", "In the midst of silence Lyra stood by Lanre\u2019s body and spoke his name. Her voice was a commandment. Her voice was steel and stone. Her voice told him to live again. But Lanre lay motionless and dead.", "In the midst of fear Lyra knelt by Lanre\u2019s body and breathed his name. Her voice was a beckoning. Her voice was love and longing. Her voice called him to live again. But Lanre lay cold and dead.", "In the midst of despair Lyra fell across Lanre\u2019s body and wept his name. Her voice was a whisper. Her voice was echo and emptiness. Her voice begged him to live again. But Lanre lay breathless and dead.", "Lanre was dead. Lyra wept brokenly and touched his face with trembling hands. All around men turned their heads, because the bloody field was less horrible to look upon than Lyra\u2019s grief.", "But Lanre heard her calling. Lanre turned at the sound of her voice and came to her. From beyond the doors of death Lanre returned. He spoke her name and took Lyra in his arms to comfort her. He opened his eyes and did his best to wipe away her tears with shaking hands. And then he drew a deep and living breath.", "The survivors of the battle saw Lanre move and they marveled. The flickering hope for peace each of them had nurtured for so long flared like hot fire inside them.", "\u201cLanre and Lyra!\u201d they shouted, their voices like thunder. \u201cOur lord\u2019s love is stronger than death! Our lady\u2019s voice has called him back! Together they have beaten death! Together, how can we help but be victorious?\u201d", "So the war continued, but with Lanre and Lyra fighting side by side the future seemed less grim. Soon everyone knew the story of how Lanre had died, and how his love and Lyra\u2019s power had drawn him back. For the first time in living memory people could speak openly of peace without being seen as fools or madmen.", "Years passed. The empire\u2019s enemies grew thin and desperate and even the most cynical of men could see the end of the war was drawing swiftly near.", "Then rumors began to spread: Lyra was ill. Lyra had been kidnapped. Lyra had died. Lanre had fled the empire. Lanre had gone mad. Some even said Lanre had killed himself and gone searching for his wife in the land of the dead. There were stories aplenty, but no one knew the truth of things.", "In the midst of these rumors, Lanre arrived in Myr Tariniel. He came alone, wearing his silver sword and haubergeon of black iron scales. His armor fit him closely as a second skin of shadow. He had wrought it from the carcass of the beast he had killed at Drossen Tor.", "Lanre asked Selitos to walk with him outside the city. Selitos agreed, hoping to learn the truth of Lanre\u2019s trouble and offer him what comfort a friend can give. They often kept each other\u2019s council, for they were both lords among their people.", "Selitos had heard the rumors, and he was worried. He feared for Lyra\u2019s health, but more he feared for Lanre. Selitos was wise. He understood how grief can twist a heart, how passions drive good men to folly.", "Together they walked the mountain paths. Lanre leading the way, they came to a high place in the mountains where they could look out over the land. The proud towers of Myr Tariniel shone brightly in the last light of the setting sun.", "After a long time Selitos said, \u201cI have heard terrible rumors concerning your wife.\u201d", "Lanre said nothing, and from his silence Selitos knew that Lyra was dead.", "After another long pause Selitos tried again. \u201cThough I do not know the whole of the matter, Myr Tariniel is here for you, and I will lend whatever aid a friend can give.\u201d", "\u201cYou have given me enough, old friend.\u201d Lanre turned and placed his hand on Selitos\u2019 shoulder. \u201cSilanxi, I bind you. By the name of stone, be still as stone. Aeruh, I command the air. Lay leaden on your tongue. Selitos, I name you. May all your powers fail you but your sight.\u201d", "Selitos knew that in all the world there were only three people who could match his skill in names: Aleph, lax, and Lyra. Lanre had no gift for names\u2014 his power lay in the strength of his arm. For him to attempt to bind Selitos by his name would be as fruitless as a boy attacking a soldier with a willow stick.", "Nevertheless, Lanre\u2019s power lay on him like a great weight, like a vise of iron, and Selitos found himself unable to move or speak. He stood, still as stone and could do nothing but marvel: how had Lanre come by such power?", "In confusion and despair, Selitos watched night settle in the mountains. With horror he saw that some of the encroaching blackness was, in fact, a great army moving upon Myr Tariniel. Worse still, no warning bells were ringing. Selitos could only stand and watch as the army crept closer in secret.", "Myr Tariniel was burned and butchered, the less that is said of it the better. The white walls were charred black and the fountains ran with blood. For a night and a day Selitos stood helpless beside Lanre and could do nothing more than watch and listen to the screams of the dying, the ring of iron, the crack of breaking stone.", "When the next day dawned on the blackened towers of the city, Selitos found he could move. He turned to Lanre and this time his sight did not fail him. He saw in Lanre a great darkness and a troubled spirit. But Selitos still felt the fetters of enchantment binding him. Fury and puzzlement warred within him, and he spoke. \u201cLanre, what have you done?\u201d", "Lanre continued to look out over the ruins of Myr Tariniel. His shoulders stooped as though he bore a great weight. There was a weariness in his voice when he spoke. \u201cWas I accounted a good man, Selitos?\u201d", "\u201cYou were counted among the best of us. We considered you beyond reproach.\u201d", "\u201cYet I did this.\u201d", "Selitos could not bring himself to look upon his ruined city. \u201cYet you did this,\u201d he agreed. \u201cWhy?\u201d", "Lanre paused. \u201cMy wife is dead. Deceit and treachery brought me to it, but her death is on my hands.\u201d He swallowed and turned to look out over the land.", "Selitos followed his eyes. From the vantage high in the mountains he saw plumes of dark smoke rising from the land below. Selitos knew with certainty and horror that Myr Tariniel was not the only city that had been destroyed. Lanre\u2019s allies had brought about the ruin of the last bastions of the empire.", "Lanre turned. \u201cAnd I counted among the best.\u201d Lanre\u2019s face was terrible to look upon. Grief and despair had ravaged it. \u201cI, considered wise and good, did all this!\u201d He gestured wildly. \u201cImagine what unholy things a lesser man must hold within his secret heart.\u201d Lanre faced Myr Tariniel and a sort of peace came over him. \u201cFor them, at least, it is over. They are safe. Safe from the thousand evils of the everyday. Safe from the pains of an unjust fate.\u201d", "Selitos spoke softly, \u201cSafe from the joy and wonder ...\u201d", "\u201cThere is no joy!\u201d Lanre shouted in an awful voice. Stones shattered at the sound and the sharp edges of echo came back to cut at them. \u201cAny joy that grows here is quickly choked by weeds. I am not some monster who destroys out of a twisted pleasure. I sow salt because the choice is between weeds and nothing.\u201d Selitos saw nothing but emptiness behind his eyes.", "Selitos stooped to pick up a jagged shard of mountain glass, pointed at one end.", "\u201cWill you kill me with a stone?\u201d Lanre gave a hollow laugh. \u201cI wanted you to understand, to know it was not madness that made me do these things.\u201d", "\u201cYou are not mad,\u201d Selitos admitted. \u201cI see no madness in you.\u201d", "\u201cI hoped, perhaps, that you would join me in what I aim to do.\u201d Lanre spoke with a desperate longing in his voice. \u201cThis world is like a friend with a mortal wound. A bitter draught given quickly only eases pain.\u201d", "\u201cDestroy the world?\u201d Selitos said softly to himself. \u201cYou are not mad, Lanre. What grips you is something worse than madness. I cannot cure you.\u201d He fingered the needle-sharp point of the stone he held.", "\u201cWill you kill me to cure me, old friend?\u201d Lanre laughed again, terrible and wild. Then he looked at Selitos with sudden, desperate hope in his hollow eyes. \u201cCan you?\u201d he asked. \u201cCan you kill me, old friend?\u201d", "Selitos, his eyes unveiled, looked at his friend. He saw how Lanre, nearly mad with grief, had sought the power to bring Lyra back to life again. Out of love for Lyra, Lanre had sought knowledge where knowledge is better left alone, and gained it at a terrible price.", "But even in the fullness of his hard-won power, he could not call Lyra back. Without her, Lanre\u2019s life was nothing but a burden, and the power he had taken up lay like a hot knife in his mind. To escape despair and agony, Lanre had killed himself. Taking the final refuge of all men, attempting to escape beyond the doors of death.", "But just as Lyra\u2019s love had drawn him back from past the final door before, so this time Lanre\u2019s power forced him to return from sweet oblivion. His new-won power burned him back into his body, forcing him to live.", "Selitos looked at Lanre and understood all. Before the power of his sight, these things hung like dark tapestries in the air about Lanre\u2019s shaking form.", "\u201cI can kill you,\u201d Selitos said, then looked away from Lanre\u2019s expression suddenly hopeful. \u201cFor an hour, or a day. But you would return, pulled like iron to a loden-stone. Your name burns with the power in you. I can no more extinguish it than I could throw a stone and strike down the moon.\u201d", "Lanre\u2019s shoulders bowed. \u201cI had hoped,\u201d he said simply. \u201cBut I knew the truth. I am no longer the Lanre you knew Mine is a new and terrible name. I am Haliax and no door can bar my passing. All is lost to me, no Lyra, no sweet escape of sleep, no blissful forgetfulness, even madness is beyond me. Death itself is an open doorway to my power. There is no escape. I have only the hope of oblivion after everything is gone and the Aleu fall nameless from the sky.\u201d And as he said this Lanre hid his face in his hands, and his body shook with silent, racking sobs.", "Selitos looked out on the land below and felt a small spark of hope. Six plumes of smoke rose from the land below. Myr Tariniel was gone, and six cities destroyed. But that meant all was not lost. One city still remained....", "In spite of all that had happened, Selitos looked at Lanre with pity, and when he spoke it was with sadness in his voice. \u201cIs there nothing then? No hope?\u201d He lay one hand on Lanre\u2019s arm. \u201cThere is sweetness in life. Even after all of this, I will help you look for it. If you will try.\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d said Lanre. He stood to his full height, his face regal behind the lines of grief. \u201cThere is nothing sweet. I will sow salt, lest the bitter weeds grow.\u201d", "\u201cI am sorry,\u201d Selitos said, and stood upright as well.", "Then Selitos spoke in a great voice, \u201cNever before has my sight been clouded. I failed to see the truth inside your heart.\u201d", "Selitos drew a deep breath. \u201cBy my eye I was deceived, never again....\u201d He raised the stone and drove its needle point into his own eye. His scream echoed among the rocks as he fell to his knees gasping. \u201cMay I never again be so blind.\u201d", "A great silence descended, and the fetters of enchantment fell away from Selitos. He cast the stone at Lanre\u2019s feet and said, \u201cBy the power of my own blood I bind you. By your own name let you be accursed.\u201d", "Selitos spoke the long name that lay in Lanre\u2019s heart, and at the sound of it the sun grew dark and wind tore stones from the mountainside.", "Then Selitos spoke, \u201cThis is my doom upon you. May your face be always held in shadow, black as the toppled towers of my beloved Myr Tariniel.", "\u201cThis is my doom upon you. Your own name will be turned against you, that you shall have no peace.", "\u201cThis is my doom upon you and all who follow you.

Soon nothing could be seen of his handsome features, only a vague impression of nose and mouth and eyes.

I cannot kill you, but I can send you from this place. Begone! The sight of you is all the fouler, knowing that you once were fair.\u201d", "But even as he spoke them, the words were bitter in his mouth.

Skarpi made a small gesture to the barkeep who set out a mug of beer as the children began to trickle out onto the street.", "I waited until the last of them had left before I approached him.

This was probably more than I had spoken in a month.", "He looked closely at me. \u201cHere are the rules,\u201d he said, ticking them off on his gnarled fingers. \u201cOne: don\u2019t talk while I\u2019m talking. Two: give a small coin, if you have it to spare.\u201d", "He looked at the ha\u2019penny on the bar.", "Not wanting to admit how much I needed it, I sought for something else to say. \u201cDo you know many stories?\u201d", "He smiled, and the network of lines that crossed his face turned to make themselves part of that smile. \u201cI only know one story. But oftentimes small pieces seem to be stories themselves.\u201d He took a drink. \u201cIt\u2019s growing all around us. In the manor houses of the Cealdim and in the workshops of the Cealdar, over the Stormwal in the great sand sea. In the low stone houses of the Adem, full of silent conversation. And sometimes.\u201d He smiled. \u201cSometimes the story is growing in squalid backstreet bars, Dockside in Tarbean.\u201d His bright eyes looked deep into me, as if I were a book that he could read.", "\u201cThere\u2019s no good story that doesn\u2019t touch the truth,\u201d I said, repeating something my father used to say, mostly to fill the silence.

It\u2019s too bad, the world could do with a little less truth and a little more ...\u201d I trailed off, not knowing what I wanted more of.

You have to be a bit of a liar to tell a story the right way. Too much truth confuses the facts. Too much honesty makes you sound insincere.\u201d", "\u201cMy father used to say the same thing.\u201d As soon as I mentioned him a confusing welter of emotions rose up in me. Only when I saw Skarpi\u2019s eyes following me did I realize I was backing nervously toward the exit.

I went back to my street corner and proceeded to waste three hours begging, not gaining so much as a thin shim for my efforts. Even this failed to dampen my spirits. Tomorrow was Mourning, but the day after there would be stories!", "But as I sat there, I felt a vague unease creep over me. A feeling that I was forgetting something impinged on my too-rare happiness. I tried to ignore it, but it stayed with me all day and into the next, like a mosquito I couldn\u2019t see, let alone swat. By the end of the day, I was certain I had forgotten something. Something about the story Skarpi had told.", "It is easy for you to see, no doubt, hearing the story like this, conveniently arranged and narrated. Keep in mind that I had been living like an animal in Tarbean for nearly three years. Pieces of my mind were still asleep, and my painful memories had been gathering dust behind the door of forgetfulness. I had grown used to avoiding them, the same way a cripple keeps weight off an injured leg.", "Luck smiled on me the next day, and I managed to steal a bundle of rags off the back of a wagon and sell them to a ragman for four iron pennies. Too hungry to worry about tomorrow, I bought a thick slice of cheese and a warm sausage, then a whole loaf of fresh bread and a warm apple tart. Finally, on a whim, I went to the back door of the nearby inn and spent my final penny on a mug of strong beer.", "I sat on the steps of a bakery across the street from the inn and watched people coming and going as I enjoyed my best meal in months. Soon twilight faded into darkness and my head began to spin pleasantly from the beer. But as the food settled in my belly, the nagging sensation returned, stronger than before. I frowned, irritated that something would spoil an otherwise perfect day.", "Night deepened until the inn across the street stood in a pool of light. A few women hovered near the doorway to the inn. They murmured in low voices and gave knowing looks to the men who walked past.", "I drank off the last of the beer and was about to cross the street and return the mug when I saw a flicker of torchlight approaching. Looking down the street, I saw the distinctive grey of a Tehlin priest and decided to wait until he had passed. Drunk on Mourning and just recently a thief, I guessed the less contact I had with the clergy the better off I\u2019d be.", "He was hooded, and the torch he carried was between us, so I couldn\u2019t see his face. He approached the group of nearby women and there was a low murmur of discussion. I heard the distinctive chink of coins and sunk further into the shadow of the doorway.", "The Tehlin turned and headed back the way he had come. I remained still, not wanting to draw his attention, not wanting to have to run for safety while my head was spinning. This time, however, the torch was not between us. When he turned to look in my direction, I could see nothing of his face, only darkness under the cowl of his hood, only shadow.", "He continued on his way, unaware of my presence, or uncaring. But I stayed where I was, unable to move. The image of the hooded man, his face hidden in shadow, had thrown open a door in my mind and memories were spilling out. I was remembering a man with empty eyes and a smile from a nightmare, remembering the blood on his sword. Cinder, his voice like a chill wind: \u201cIs this your parent\u2019s fire?\u201d", "Not him, the man behind him. The quiet one who had sat beside the fire. The man whose face was hidden in shadow. Haliax. This had been the half-remembered thing hovering on the edge of my awareness since I had heard Skarpi\u2019s story.", "I ran to the rooftops and wrapped myself in my rag blanket. Pieces of story and memory slowly fit together. I began to admit impossible truths to myself. The Chandrian were real. Haliax was real. If the story Skarpi had told was true, then Lanre and Haliax were the same person. The Chandrian had killed my parents, my whole troupe. Why?", "Other memories bubbled to the surface of my mind. I saw the man with black eyes, Cinder, kneeling in front of me.

They had killed my whole troupe over a song. I sat awake all night with little more than these thoughts running through my head. Slowly I came to realize them as the truth.", "What did I do then? Did I swear I would find them, kill them all for what they had done? Perhaps. But even if I did, I knew in my heart it was impossible. Tarbean had taught me hard practicality. Kill the Chandrian? Kill Lanre? How could I even begin? I would have more luck trying to steal the moon. At least I knew where to look for the moon at night.", "But there was one thing I could do. Tomorrow I would ask Skarpi for the real truth behind his stories. It wasn\u2019t much, but it was all I had. Revenge might be beyond me, at least for now.

The fire flickered in their eyes and they saw into the deepest hearts of men. The fire filled their mouths and they sang songs of power.

From all that would harm you in the world?", "The Chandrian had enemies. If I could find them, they would help me. I had no idea who the singers or the Sithe were, but everyone knew that the Amyr were church knights, the strong right hand of the Aturan Empire. Unfortunately, everyone also knew that there had been no Amyr in three hundred years. They had been disbanded when the Aturan Empire collapsed.", "But Haliax had spoken of them as if they still existed.

Perhaps I should add a third D\u201d", "He gave another sharp, barking laugh and smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ve convinced me, young master.\u201d He pulled out a fresh slip of paper and set it in front of me. \u201cYou write me a receipt, and I will sign it.\u201d", "I took up the pen and wrote. \u201cI the undersigned, do agree to return the copy of the book Rhetoric and Logic with the inscription \u201cto Kvothe\u201d to the bearer of this note in exchange for two silver pennies, provided he present this receipt before the date\u2014\u201d", "I looked up. \u201cWhat day is it?\u201d", "\u201cShuden. The thirty-fifth.\u201d", "I had fallen out of the habit of keeping track of the date. On the streets, one day is largely the same as the next, save that people are a little more drunk on Hepten, a little more generous on Mourning.", "But if it was the thirty-fifth then I only had five days to get to the University. I knew from Ben that admissions only lasted until Cendling. If I missed them, I would have to wait two months for the next term to start.", "I filled in the date on the receipt and drew a line for the bookseller to sign. He looked a little bemused as I slid the paper toward him. What\u2019s more, he didn\u2019t notice that the receipt read pennies instead of talents. Talents were worth significantly more. This meant he had just agreed to give me back the book for less money than he had bought it for.", "My satisfaction damped itself when it occurred to me how foolish all of this was. Pennies or talents, I wouldn\u2019t have enough money to buy the book back in two span. If everything went well I wouldn\u2019t even be in Tarbean tomorrow.", "Despite its uselessness, the receipt helped ease the sting of parting with the last thing I owned from my childhood. I blew on the paper, folded it carefully into a pocket, and collected my two silver talents. I was surprised when the man held out his hand to me.", "He smiled in an apologetic way. \u201cSorry about the note. But you didn\u2019t look like you\u2019d be coming back.\u201d He gave a little shrug. \u201cHere.\u201d He pressed a copper jot into my hand.", "I decided that he was not an altogether bad fellow. I smiled back at him and for a second I almost felt guilty about how I\u2019d written the receipt.", "I also felt guilty about the three pens I\u2019d stolen, but only for a second.

I wore it underneath my clothes, tight against my skin.", "Next was a real breakfast. A plateful of hot eggs and a slice of ham. Bread that was fresh and soft, plenty of honey and butter on the side, and a glass of milk not two days from the cow. It cost me five iron pennies. It may be the best meal I ever ate.", "It felt strange sitting at a table, eating with a knife and fork. It felt strange being around people. It felt strange having a person bring me food.", "As I mopped up the remnants of my breakfast with an end of bread, I realized that I had a problem.", "Even in this slightly grubby inn Waterside, I was attracting attention. My shirt was nothing more than an old burlap sack with holes for my arms and head. My pants were made out of canvas and too big by several degrees. They reeked of smoke, grease, and stagnant alley water. I\u2019d been holding them up with a length of rope I had dug out of some trash. I was filthy, barefoot, and I stank.", "Should I buy clothes or try to find a bath? If I bathed first, I would have to wear my old clothes afterward. However, if I tried to buy clothes looking the way I did now, I might not even be let into the store. And I doubted that anyone would want to measure me for a fit.", "The innkeep came to take my plate, and I decided on a bath first, mainly because I was sick to death of smelling like a week-dead rat. I smiled up at him. \u201cWhere can I find a bath near here?\u201d", "\u201cHere, if you have a couple pennies.\u201d He looked me over. \u201cOr I\u2019ll work you an hour instead, a good hard hour.

Fair?\u201d", "An hour or so later my shoulders ached and the hearth was clean. He showed me to a back room with a large wooden tub and a grate on the floor. There were pegs along the walls for clothes, and a sheet of tin nailed to the wall served as a crude mirror.", "He brought me a brush, a bucket of steaming water, and a cake of lye soap. I scrubbed until I was sore and pink. The innkeeper brought a second bucket of hot water, then a third. I gave a silent prayer of thanks that I didn\u2019t seem to be lousy. I had probably been too filthy for any self-respecting louse to take up residence.", "As I rinsed myself for the last time, I looked at my discarded clothes. Cleaner than I\u2019d been in years, I didn\u2019t want to touch them, let alone wear them. If I tried to wash them they\u2019d simply fall apart.", "I dried myself off and I used the rough brush to pull through the snarls in my hair. It was longer than it had seemed when it was dirty. I wiped the fog from the makeshift mirror and was surprised. I looked old, older at any rate. Not only that, I looked like some young noble\u2019s son. My face was lean and fair. My hair needed a bit of a trim, but was shoulder-length and straight, as was the current fashion. The only thing missing was a noble\u2019s clothes.", "And that gave me an idea.", "Still naked, I wrapped myself in a towel and left by the back door. I took my purse but kept it out of sight. It was a little before noon and people were everywhere. Needless to say, quite a few eyes were turned in my direction. I ignored them and set a brisk pace, not trying to hide. I composed my features into an impassive, angry mask without a trace of embarrassment.", "I stopped by a father and son loading burlap sacks into a cart. The son was about four years older than me and head and shoulders taller. \u201cBoy,\u201d I snapped. \u201cWhere can I buy some clothes around here?\u201d I looked pointedly at his shirt. \u201cDecent clothes,\u201d I amended.", "He looked at me, his expression somewhere between confusion and anger. His father hurriedly took off his hat and stepped in front of his son. \u201cYour lordship might try Bentley\u2019s. It\u2019s plain stuff, but it\u2019s only a street or two away.\u201d", "I darkened my expression. \u201cIs it the only place about?\u201d", "He gaped. \u201cWell ... it could ... there\u2019s one ...\u201d", "I waved him impatiently into silence. \u201cWhere is it? Simply point, since your wits have left you.\u201d", "He pointed and I strode off. As I walked I remembered one of the young page parts I used to play in the troupe. The page\u2019s name was Dunstey, an insufferably petulant little boy with an important father. He was perfect. I gave my head an imperious tilt, set my shoulders a little differently and made a couple of mental adjustments.", "I threw open the door and stormed in. There was a man in a leather apron who I can only assume was Bentley He was fortyish, thin, and balding. He jumped at the sound of his door banging against the wall.

I\u2019m sick of being gawked at by you and every other mewler that decided to go marketing today.\u201d I slouched into a chair and sulked.

Are my needs perhaps inobvious?\u201d I tugged at the edge of my towel to demonstrate.", "He stood there, gaping.", "I lowered my voice menacingly, \u201cIf you don\u2019t bring me something to wear\u2014\u201d I stood up and shouted, \u201c\u2014I\u2019ll tear this place apart! I\u2019ll ask my father for your stones as a Midwinter gift. I\u2019ll have his dogs mount your dead corpse. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO I AM?\u201d", "Bendy scurried away, and I threw myself back into the chair. A customer I hadn\u2019t noticed until now made a hurried exit, stopping briefly to curtsy to me before she left.", "I fought back the urge to laugh.", "After that it was surprisingly easy. I kept him running about for half an hour, bringing me one piece of clothing or another. I mocked the material, the cut, and workmanship of everything he brought out. In short, I was the perfect little brat.", "In truth I couldn\u2019t have been more pleased. The clothing was plain but well made. Indeed, compared to what I had been wearing an hour before, a clean burlap sack would have been a great step up.", "If you haven\u2019t spent much time in court or in large cities, you won\u2019t understand why this was so easy for me to accomplish.

When you\u2019re struck with one of these catastrophes, the only thing an average man can do is grit his teeth and try to minimize the damage.", "Bentley knew this. He marked the shirt and pants and helped me out of them. I got back into the robe he had given me, and he began sewing like the devil was breathing down his neck.", "I flounced back into the chair. \u201cYou might as well ask.

I fidgeted. Finally, I continued as if he had asked me, \u201cA whore stole my clothes.\u201d", "\u201cReally, sir?\u201d", "\u201cYes, she tried to get me to trade them for my purse, the bitch.\u201d", "Bentley looked up briefly, genuine curiosity on his face. \u201cWasn\u2019t your purse with your clothes, sir?\u201d", "I looked shocked. \u201cCertainly not! \u2018A gentleman\u2019s hand is never far away from his purse.\u2019 So my father says.\u201d I waved my purse at him to make my point.", "I noticed him trying to suppress a laugh and it made me feel a little better. I\u2019d made the man miserable for almost an hour, the least I could give him was a story to tell his friends.", "\u201cShe told me if I wanted to keep my dignity, then I\u2019d give her my purse and walk home wearing my clothes.\u201d I shook my head scornfully. \u201c \u2018Wanton,\u2019 I said to her,\u2019A gentleman\u2019s dignity isn\u2019t in his clothes. If I handed over my purse simply to save myself an embarrassment then I would be handing over my dignity.\u2019 \u201d", "I looked thoughtful for a second, then spoke softly as if thinking aloud. \u201cIt only follows that a gentleman\u2019s dignity is in his purse then.\u201d I looked at the purse in my hands, and gave a long pause. \u201cI think I heard my father say something of the sort the other day.\u201d", "Bentley gave a laugh that he turned into a cough, then stood up and shook out the shirt and pants. \u201cThere you go, sir, fit you like a glove now.\u201d A hint of a smile played around his lips as he handed them to me.", "I slid out of the robe and pulled on the pants. \u201cThey\u2019ll get me home, I suppose. How much for your trouble, Bentley?\u201d I asked.", "He thought for a second. \u201cOne and two.\u201d", "I began to lace up my shirt and said nothing.", "\u201cSorry, sir,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cForgot who I was dealing with.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cOne even would do nicely\u201d", "Taking out my purse, I put one silver talent into his hand and looked him in the eye. \u201cI will be needing some change.\u201d", "His mouth made a thin line, but he nodded and handed me back two jots.", "I tucked the coins away and tied my purse firmly underneath my shirt, then gave him a meaningful look and patted it.", "I saw the smile tug at his lips again. \u201cGood-bye, sir.\u201d", "I picked up my towel, left the store, and started my altogether less conspicuous walk back to the inn where I had found breakfast and a bath.", "", "\u201cWhat can I get for you, young sir?\u201d the innkeeper asked as I approached the bar.

And I would have bet a solid mark your hair was black. You really don\u2019t look the same.\u201d He marveled mutely for a second. \u201cWould you like your old clothes?\u201d", "I shook my head. \u201cThrow them away\u2014actually, burn them, and make sure no one accidentally breathes the smoke.\u201d He laughed again. \u201cI did have some other items though.\u201d I reminded him.", "He nodded and tapped the side of his nose. \u201cRight enough. Just a second.\u201d He turned and disappeared though a doorway behind the bar.", "I let my attention wander around the room. It seemed different now that I wasn\u2019t attracting hostile stares. The fieldstone fireplace with the black kettle simmering. The slightly sour smells of varnished wood and spilled beer. The low rumble of conversation....", "I\u2019ve always had a fondness for taverns. It comes from growing up on the road, I think. A tavern is a safe place, a refuge of sorts. I felt very comfortable just then, and it occurred to me that it wouldn\u2019t be a bad life, owning a place like this.", "\u201cHere you go then.\u201d The innkeeper laid down three pens, a jar of ink, and my receipt from the bookstore. \u201cThese gave me almost as much of a puzzle as why you had run off without your clothes.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m going to the University.\u201d I explained.", "He raised an eyebrow. \u201cA little young, aren\u2019t you?\u201d", "I felt a nervous chill at his words, but shrugged it off. \u201cThey take all kinds.\u201d", "He nodded politely as if that explained why I had shown up barefoot and reeking of back alleys. After waiting for a while to see if I\u2019d elaborate, the barman poured himself a drink. \u201cNo offense, but you don\u2019t exactly look to be the sort who would want to be washin\u2019 dishes anymore.\u201d", "I opened my mouth to protest; an iron penny for an hour\u2019s work was a bargain I was hesitant to pass up. Two pennies was the same as a loaf of bread, and I couldn\u2019t count all the times that I had been hungry in the last year.", "Then I saw my hands resting on the bar. They were pink and clean, I almost didn\u2019t recognize them for my own.", "I realized then I didn\u2019t want to do the dishes. I had more important things to do. I stood back from the bar and got a penny from my purse. \u201cWhere\u2019s the best place to find a caravan leaving for the north?\u201d I asked.", "\u201cDrover\u2019s Lot, up Hillside. Quarter mile past the mill on Green Street.\u201d", "I felt a nervous chill when Hillside was mentioned. I ignored it as best I could and nodded. \u201cYou have a lovely inn here. I\u2019d count myself lucky to have one as nice when I\u2019ve grown up.\u201d I handed him the penny.", "He broke into a huge smile and handed back the penny. \u201cWith such nice compliments, you come back any time.\u201d", "", "", ""], "CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO": ["CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO", "Coppers, Cobblers and Crowds", "\nIt was about an hour before noon when I stepped out onto the street.

It followed me until my instincts got the better of me and I slipped into a side alley quick as a fish.", "As I stood pressed against a wall, waiting, the feeling faded. After a few minutes, I began to feel foolish. I trusted my instincts, but they gave false alarms every now and again. I waited a few more minutes just to be sure, then moved back into the street.", "The feeling of vague unease returned almost immediately. I ignored it while trying to find out where it was coming from. But after five minutes I lost my nerve and turned onto a side street, watching the crowd to see who was following me.", "No one. It took a nerve-wracking half hour and two more alleys before I finally figured out what it was.", "It felt strange to be walking with the crowd.", "Over the last couple years crowds had become a part of the scenery of the city to me. I might use a crowd to hide from a guard or a storekeeper. I might move through a crowd to get where I was going. I might even be going in the same direction as the crowd, but I was never a part of it.", "I was so used to being ignored, I almost ran from the first merchant who tried to sell me something.", "Once I knew what was bothering me, the greater part of my uneasiness left.

So perhaps you will understand why, when the crowd in front of me happened to part for a moment, I saw what I was looking for. A member of the guard. I ducked through the nearest door, my heart pounding.", "I spent a moment reminding myself that I wasn\u2019t the same filthy little urchin who\u2019d been beaten years ago. I was well-dressed and clean. I looked like I belonged here. But old habits die slow deaths. I fought to control a deep red anger, but couldn\u2019t tell if I was angry at myself, the guard, or the world in general. Probably a little of each.", "\u201cBe right with you,\u201d came a cheerful voice from a curtained doorway.", "I looked around the shop. Light from the front window fell across a crowded workbench and dozens of shelved pairs of shoes. I decided I could have picked a worse store to wander into.", "\u201cLet me guess\u2014\u201d came the voice again from the back. A grandfather-grey man emerged from behind the curtain carrying a long piece of leather. He was short and stooped, but his face smiled at me through his wrinkles. \u201c\u2014you need shoes.\u201d He smiled timidly, as if the joke was a pair of old boots that had worn out long ago, but were too comfortable to give up. He looked down at my feet. I looked too, in spite of myself.", "I was barefoot of course. I hadn\u2019t had shoes for so long that I never even thought about them anymore. At least not during the summer. In the winter, I dreamed of shoes.", "I looked up. The old man\u2019s eyes were dancing, as if he couldn\u2019t decide whether laughing would cost him his customer or not. \u201cI guess I need shoes,\u201d I admitted.", "He laughed and guided me into a seat, measuring my bare feet with his hands. Thankfully the streets were dry, so my feet were merely dusty from the cobblestones. If there had been rain they would have been embarrassingly filthy", "\u201cLet\u2019s see what you like, and if I have anything of a size for you. If not, I can make or change a pair to fit you in an hour or two. So, what would you be wanting shoes for? Walking? Dancing? Riding?\u201d He leaned back on his stool and grabbed a pair off a shelf behind him.", "\u201cWalking.\u201d", "\u201cThought so.\u201d He deftly rolled a pair of stockings onto my feet, as if all his customers came in barefoot. He tucked my feet into a pair of something black with buckles. \u201cHow\u2019s those feel? Put a little weight on to make sure.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2014\u201d", "\u201cThey\u2019re tight. I thought so. Nothing more annoying that a shoe that pinches.\u201d He stripped me out of them, and into another pair, quick as a whip. \u201cHow about these?\u201d They were a deep purple and made of velvet or felt.", "\u201cThey\u2014\u201d", "\u201cNot quite what you\u2019re looking for? Don\u2019t blame you really, wear out terrible fast.

I pressed my foot to the ground, and it hugged me. I had forgotten how wonderful a good shoe can feel. \u201cHow much?\u201d I asked apprehensively.", "Instead of answering he stood, and started searching the shelves with his eyes. \u201cYou can tell a lot about a person by their feet,\u201d he mused. \u201cSome men come in here, smiling and laughing, shoes all clean and brushed, socks all powdered up. But when the shoes are off, their feet smell just fearsome. Those are the people that hide things. They\u2019ve got bad smelling secrets and they try to hide \u2019em, just like they try to hide their feet.\u201d", "He turned to look at me. \u201cIt never works though. Only way to stop your feet from smelling is to let them air out a bit. Could be the same thing with secrets. I don\u2019t know about that, though. I just know about shoes.\u201d", "He began to look through the clutter of his workbench. \u201cSome of these young men from the court come in, fanning their faces and moaning about the latest tragedy. But their feet are so pink and soft. You know they\u2019ve never walked anywhere on their own. You know they\u2019ve never really been hurt.\u201d", "He finally found what he was looking for, holding up a pair of shoes similar to the pair I wore. \u201cHere we go. These were my Jacob\u2019s when he was your age.\u201d He sat on his stool and unlaced the pair of shoes I was wearing.", "\u201cNow you,\u201d he continued, \u201chave old soles for a boy so young: scars, calluses. Feet like these could run barefoot all day on stone and not need shoes. A boy your age only gets these feet one way.\u201d", "He looked up at me, making it a question. I nodded.", "He smiled and lay a hand on my shoulder. \u201cHow do they feel?\u201d", "I stood up to test them. If anything, they were more comfortable than the newer pair for being a little broken in.", "\u201cNow, this pair,\u201d he waved the shoes he held, \u201care new. They haven\u2019t been walked a mile, and for new shoes like these I charge a talent, maybe a talent and two.\u201d He pointed at my feet. \u201cThose shoes, on the other hand, are used, and I don\u2019t sell used shoes.\u201d", "He turned his back on me and started to tidy his workbench rather aimlessly, humming to himself. It took me a second to recognize the tune: \u201cLeave the Town, Tinker.\u201d", "I knew that he was trying to do me a favor, and a week ago I would have jumped at the opportunity for free shoes. But for some reason I didn\u2019t feel right about it. I quietly gathered up my things and left a pair of copper jots on his stool before I left.", "Why? Because pride is a strange thing, and because generosity deserves generosity in return. But mostly because it felt like the right thing to do, and that is reason enough.", "", "\u201cFour days. Six days if raining.\u201d", "Roent was the third wagoneer I\u2019d asked about going north to Imre, the town nearest the University. He was a thick-bodied Cealdish man with a fierce black beard that hid most of his face. He turned away and barked curses in Siaru at a man loading a wagon with bolts of cloth. When he spoke his native language, he sounded like an angry rockslide.", "His rough voice lowered to a rumble as he turned back to me. \u201cTwo coppers. Jots. Not pennies. You can ride in a wagon if there is space. You can sleep underneath at night if you want. You eat in the evening with us. Lunch is just bread. If a wagon gets stuck, you help push.\u201d", "There was another pause while he shouted at the men. There were three wagons being packed with trade goods while the fourth was achingly familiar, one of the wheeled houses I had spent most of my early life riding. Roent\u2019s wife, Reta, sat in the front of that wagon. Her mien wavered from severe, when she watched the men loading the wagons, to smiling when she spoke with a girl standing nearby.", "I assumed the girl was a passenger like myself. She was my age, perhaps a year older, but a year makes a great deal of difference at that time of life. The Tahl have a saying about children of our age. The boy grows upward, but the girl grows up.", "She was dressed practically for traveling, pants and shirt, and was just young enough for it not to seem improper. Her bearing was such that if she had been a year older, I would have been forced to see her as a lady. As it was, when she spoke with Reta she moved back and forth between a genteel grace and a childlike exuberance. She had long, dark hair, and....", "Simply said, she was beautiful. It had been a long time since I had seen anything beautiful.", "Roent followed my gaze and continued. \u201cEveryone helps set camp at night. Everyone takes a turn watching. You fall asleep during your watch, you get left behind. You eat with us, whatever my wife cooks. You complain, you get left behind. You walk too slow, you get left behind. You bother the girl ...\u201d He ran a hand through his thick dark beard. \u201cBad things happen.\u201d", "Hoping to turn his thoughts in a different direction, I spoke up, \u201cWhen will the wagons be done loading?\u201d", "\u201cTwo hours,\u201d he said with a grim certainty, as if defying the workers to contradict him.", "One of the men stood upright atop a wagon, shading his eyes with a hand. He called out, raising his voice over the sound of horses, wagons, and men that filled the square. \u201cDon\u2019t let him scare you off, kid. He\u2019s decent enough after all the growling.\u201d Roent pointed a stern finger, and the man turned back to his work.", "I hardly needed to be convinced. A man who travels with his wife is usually to be trusted. Besides, the price was fair, and he was leaving today. I took this opportunity to pull a pair of jots from my purse and hold them out to Roent.", "He turned to me. \u201cTwo hours.\u201d He held up thick fingers to make his point. \u201cYou are late, you get left behind.\u201d", "I nodded solemnly. \u201cRieusa, tu kialus A\u2019isha tua.\u201d Thank you for bringing me close to your family.", "Roent\u2019s great shaggy eyebrows went up. He recovered quickly and gave a quick nod that was almost a small bow. I looked around the square, trying to get my bearings.", "\u201cSomeone\u2019s full of surprises.\u201d I turned around to see the worker who had shouted to me from the wagon. He held out his hand. \u201cDerrik.\u201d", "I shook his hand, feeling awkward. It had been so long since I\u2019d made simple conversation with someone that I felt strange and hesitant. \u201cKvothe.\u201d", "Derrik put his hands behind him and stretched his back with a grimace. He stood head and shoulders taller than me, twenty or so, tall and blond. \u201cYou gave Roent a bit of a turn there. Where\u2019d you learn to speak Siaru?\u201d", "\u201cAn arcanist taught me a little,\u201d I explained. I watched as Roent went to speak to his wife. The dark-haired girl looked in my direction and smiled. I looked away, not knowing what to make of it.", "He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to fetch your things, then. Roent\u2019s all growl and not much gruff, but he won\u2019t wait once the wagons are packed.\u201d", "I nodded, even though my \u201cthings\u201d were nonexistent. I did have a little shopping to do. They say you can find anything in Tarbean if you have enough money. For the most part, they are right.", "", "I made my way down the stairs to Trapis\u2019 basement. It felt strange to make the trip wearing shoes. I was used to the cool damp of stone underfoot when I came to pay a visit.", "As I made my way down the short hallway, a boy in rags emerged from the inner rooms holding a small winter apple. He pulled up short when he saw me, then scowled, his eyes narrow and suspicious. Looking down, he brushed roughly past me.", "Without even thinking about it, I slapped his hand away from my purse and turned to look at him, too stunned for words. He bolted outside, leaving me confused and disturbed. We never stole from each other here. Out on the streets it was everyone for themselves, but Trapis\u2019 basement was the closest thing to a sanctuary we had, like a church. None of us would risk spoiling that.", "I took the last few steps into the main room and was relieved to see that everything else seemed normal. Trapis wasn\u2019t there, probably off collecting charity to help him care for his children. There were six cots, all full, and more children lying on the floor. Several grubby urchins stood around a bushel basket on the table, clutching winter apples. They turned to stare at me, their expressions flinty and spiteful.", "It dawned on me then. None of them recognized me. Clean and well-dressed, I looked like some regular boy come wandering in. I didn\u2019t belong.", "Just then Trapis came back, carrying several flat loaves of bread under one arm and a squalling child in the other. \u201cAri,\u201d he called to one of the boys standing near the bushel basket. \u201cCome help. We\u2019ve got a new visitor and she needs changing.\u201d", "The boy hurried over and took the child out of Trapis\u2019 arms. He lay the bread on the table next to the bushel basket and all the children\u2019s eyes fixed on him attentively. My stomach went sour. Trapis hadn\u2019t even looked at me. What if he didn\u2019t recognize me? What if he told me to leave? I didn\u2019t know if I could cope with that, I began to edge toward the door.", "Trapis pointed to the children one at a time. \u201cLet me see. David, you empty and scrub the drinking barrel. It\u2019s getting brackish. When he\u2019s done Nathan can fill it from the pump.\u201d", "\u201cCan I take twice?\u201d Nathan asked. \u201cI need some for my brother.\u201d", "\u201cYour brother can come for his own bread,\u201d Trapis said gently, then looked more closely at the boy, sensing something. \u201cIs he hurt?\u201d", "Nathan nodded, looking at the floor.", "Trapis laid a hand on the boy\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBring him down. We\u2019ll see to him.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s his leg.\u201d Nathan blurted, seeming close to tears. \u201cIt\u2019s all hot, and he can\u2019t walk!\u201d", "Trapis nodded and gestured to the next child. \u201cJen, you help Nathan bring his brother back.\u201d They hurried out. \u201cTarn, since Nathan\u2019s gone, you carry the water instead.\u201d", "\u201cKvothe, you run for soap.\u201d He held out a halfpenny. \u201cGo to Marna\u2019s in the Wash. You\u2019ll get better from her if you tell her who it\u2019s for.\u201d", "I felt a sudden lump form in my throat. He knew me. I can\u2019t hope to explain to you how much of a relief it was. Trapis was the closest thing I had to a family. The thought of him not knowing me had been horrifying.", "\u201cI don\u2019t have time to run an errand, Trapis.\u201d I said hesitantly \u201cI\u2019m leaving. I\u2019m heading inland, to Imre.\u201d", "\u201cAre you then?\u201d he asked, then paused and gave me a second, closer look. \u201cWell then, I guess you are.\u201d", "Of course. Trapis never saw the clothes, only the child inside them. \u201cI stopped by to let you know where my things are. On the roof of the candle works there\u2019s a place where three roofs meet. There are some things there, a blanket, a bottle. I don\u2019t need any of it anymore. It\u2019s a good place to sleep if anyone needs one, dry. No one goes there....\u201d I trailed off.", "\u201cThat\u2019s kind of you. I\u2019ll send one of the boys round,\u201d Trapis said. \u201cCome here.\u201d He came forward and gathered me into a clumsy hug, his beard tickling the side of my face. \u201cI\u2019m always glad to see one of you get away,\u201d he said softly to me. \u201cI know you\u2019ll do just fine for yourself, but you can always come back if you need to.\u201d", "One of the girls on a nearby cot began to thrash and moan. Trapis pulled away from me and turned to look. \u201cWhat what,\u201d he said as he hurried over to tend to her, his bare feet slapping on the floor. \u201cWhat what. Hush hush.\u201d", "", "", ""], "CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE": ["CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE", "A Sea of Stars", "\nI returned to Drover\u2019s Lot with a travelsack swinging by one shoulder.

It was warm, clean, and, unless I missed my guess, only one owner from new.", "Now let me say this: when you\u2019re traveling a good cloak is worth more than all your other possessions put together. If you\u2019ve nowhere to sleep, it can be your bed and blanket. It will keep the rain off your back and the sun from your eyes. You can conceal all manner of interesting weaponry beneath it if you are clever, and a smaller assortment if you are not.", "But beyond all that, two facts remain to recommend a cloak. First, very little is as striking as a well-worn cloak, billowing lightly about you in the breeze. And second, the best cloaks have innumerable little pockets that I have an irrational and overpowering attraction toward.", "As I have said, this was a good cloak, and it had a number of such pockets. Squirreled away in them I had string and wax, some dried apple, a tinderbox, a marble in a small leather sack, a pouch of salt, hook-needle and gut.", "I\u2019d made a point of spending all my carefully hoarded Commonwealth coin, keeping my hard Cealdish currency for my trip. Pennies spent well enough here in Tarbean, but Cealdish money was solid no matter where in the four corners you found yourself.", "A final flurry of preparation was being made as I arrived. Roent paced around the wagons like a restless animal, checking everything again and again. Reta watched the workers with a stern eye and a quick word for anything that wasn\u2019t being done to her satisfaction. I was comfortably ignored until we headed out of the city, toward the University.", "", "As the miles rolled away, it was as if a great weight slowly fell away from me. I reveled in the feel of the ground through my shoes, the taste of the air, the quiet hush of wind brushing through the spring wheat in the fields. I found myself grinning for no good reason, save that I was happy. We Ruh are not meant to stay in one place for so long. I took a deep breath and nearly laughed out loud.", "I kept to myself as we traveled, not being used to the company of others. Roent and the mercenaries were willing to leave me alone. Derrik joked with me off and on, but generally found me too reserved for his tastes.", "That left the other passenger, Denna. We didn\u2019t speak until the first day\u2019s ride was nearly done. I was riding with one of the mercenaries, absently peeling the bark from a willow switch. While my fingers worked, I studied the side of her face, admiring the line of her jaw, the curve of her neck into her shoulder. I wondered why she was traveling alone, and where she was going. In the middle of my musing she turned to look in my direction and caught me staring at her.", "\u201cPenny for your thought?\u201d she asked, brushing at an errant strand of hair.", "\u201cI was wondering what you\u2019re doing here,\u201d I said half-honestly", "Smiling, she held my eyes. \u201cLiar.\u201d", "I used an old stage trick to keep myself from blushing, gave my best unconcerned shrug, and looked down at the willow wand I was peeling. After a few minutes, I heard her return to her conversation with Reta. I found myself strangely disappointed.", "After camp was set and dinner was cooking, I idled around the wagons, examining the knots Roent used to lash his cargo into place. I heard a footfall behind me and turned to see Denna approaching. My stomach rolled over and I took a short breath to compose myself.", "She stopped about a dozen feet from me. \u201cHave you figured it out yet?\u201d she asked.", "\u201cExcuse me?\u201d", "\u201cWhy I\u2019m here.\u201d She smiled gently. \u201cI\u2019ve been wondering the same thing for most my life, you see. I thought if you had any ideas....\u201d she gave me a wry, hopeful look.", "I shook my head, too uncertain of the situation to find the humor in it. \u201cAll I\u2019ve been able to guess is that you\u2019re going somewhere.\u201d", "She nodded seriously. \u201cThat\u2019s as much as I\u2019ve guessed too.\u201d She paused to look at the circle the horizon made around us. The wind caught her hair and she brushed it back again. \u201cDo you happen to know where I\u2019m going?\u201d", "I felt a smile begin a slow creep onto my face. It felt odd. I was out of practice smiling. \u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d", "\u201cI have suspicions. Right now I\u2019m thinking Anilin.\u201d She rocked onto the edges of her feet, then back to the flats. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been wrong before.\u201d", "A silence settled over our conversation. Denna looked down at her hands, fidgeting with a ring on her finger, twisting it. I caught a glimpse of silver and a pale blue stone. Suddenly she dropped her hands to her sides and looked up at me. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d", "\u201cThe University.\u201d", "She arched an eyebrow, looking ten years older. \u201cSo certain.\u201d She smiled and was suddenly young again. \u201cHow does it feel to know where you are going?\u201d", "I couldn\u2019t think of a reply, but was saved from the need for one by Reta calling us for supper. Denna and I walked toward the campfire, together.", "", "The beginning of the next day was spent in a brief, awkward courtship. Eager, but not wanting to seem eager, I made a slow dance around Denna before finally finding some excuse to spend time with her.", "Denna, on the other hand, seemed perfectly at ease. We spent the rest of the day as if we were old friends. We joked and told stories. I pointed out the different types of clouds and what they told of the weather to come. She showed me the shapes they held: a rose, a harp, a waterfall.", "So passed the day. Later, when lots were being drawn to see who had which turn at watch, Denna and I drew the first two shifts. Without discussing it, we shared the four hours of watch together. Talking softly so as to not wake the others, we sat close by the fire and spent the time watching very little but each other.", "The third day was much the same. We passed the time pleasantly, not in long conversation, but more often watching the scenery, saying whatever happened to come to our minds. That night we stopped at a wayside inn where Reta bought fodder for the horses and a few other supplies.", "Reta retired early with her husband, telling each of us that she\u2019d arranged for our dinners and beds with the innkeeper. The former was quite good, bacon and potato soup with fresh bread and butter. The latter was in the stables, but it was still a long sight better than what I was used to in Tarbean.", "The common room smelled of smoke and sweat and spilled beer. I was glad when Denna asked if I wanted to take a walk. Outside was the warm quiet of a windless spring night. We talked as we wended our slow way through the wild bit of forest behind the inn. After a while we came to a wide clearing circling a pond.", "On the edge of the water were a pair of waystones, their surfaces silver against the black of the sky, the black of the water. One stood upright, a finger pointing to the sky. The other lay flat, extending into the water like a short stone pier.", "No breath of wind disturbed the surface of the water. So as we climbed out onto the fallen stone the stars reflected themselves in double fashion; as above, so below. It was as if we were sitting amid a sea of stars.", "We spoke for hours, late into the night. Neither of us mentioned our pasts. I sensed that there were things she would rather not talk about, and by the way she avoided questioning me, I think she guessed the same. We spoke of ourselves instead, of fond imaginings and impossible things. I pointed to the skies and told her the names of stars and constellations. She told me stories about them I had never heard before.", "My eyes were always returning to Denna. She sat beside me, arms hugging her knees. Her skin was more luminous than the moon, her eyes wider than the sky, deeper than the water, darker than the night.", "It slowly began to dawn on me that I had been staring at her wordlessly for an impossible amount of time. Lost in my thoughts, lost in the sight of her. But her face didn\u2019t look offended or amused. It almost looked as if she were studying the lines of my face, almost as if she were waiting.", "I wanted to take her hand. I wanted to brush her cheek with my fingertips. I wanted to tell her that she was the first beautiful thing I had seen in three years. That the sight of her yawning to the back of her hand was enough to drive the breath from me. How I sometimes lost the sense of her words in the sweet fluting of her voice. I wanted to say that if she were with me then somehow nothing could ever be wrong for me again.", "In that breathless second I almost asked her. I felt the question boiling up from my chest. I remember drawing a breath then hesitating\u2014what could I say? Come away with me? Stay with me? Come to the University? No. Sudden certainty tightened in my chest like a cold fist. What could I ask her? What could I offer? Nothing. Anything I said would sound foolish, a child\u2019s fantasy", "I closed my mouth and looked across the water. Inches away, Denna did the same. I could feel the heat of her. She smelled like road dust, and honey, and the smell the air holds seconds before a heavy summer rain.", "Neither of us spoke. I closed my eyes. The closeness of her was the sweetest, sharpest thing my life had ever known.", "", "", ""], "CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR": ["CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR", "Yet to Learn", "\nThe next morning I blearily awoke after two hours of sleep, bundled myself onto one of the wagons and proceeded to drowse away the morning. It was nearly noon before I realized that we had taken on another passenger at the inn last night.", "His name was Josn, and he had paid Roent for passage to Anilin. He had an easy manner and an honest smile. He seemed an earnest man. I did not like him.", "My reason was simple. He spent the entire day riding next to Denna. He flattered her outrageously and joked with her about becoming one of his wives. She seemed unaffected by the late hours we had kept the night before, looking as bright and fresh as ever.", "The result was that I spent the day being irritated and jealous while acting unconcerned. Since I was too proud to join their conversation, I was left to myself. I spent the day thinking sullen thoughts, trying to ignore the sound of his voice and occasionally remembering the way Denna had looked last night with the moon reflecting off the water behind her.", "", "That night I was planning to ask Denna to go for a walk after everyone turned in for the night. But before I could approach her, Josn went to one of the wagons and brought back a large black case with brass buckles along the side. The sight of it made my heart turn sideways in my chest.", "Sensing the group\u2019s anticipation, though not mine in particular, Josn slowly undid the brass clasps and drew out his lute with an air of studied nonchalance. It was a troupers lute, its long, graceful neck and round bowl were painfully familiar. Sure of everyone\u2019s attention, he cocked his head and strummed, pausing to listen to the sound. Then, nodding to himself, he started to play.", "He had a fair tenor and reasonably clever fingers. He played a ballad, then a light, quick drinking song, then a slow, sad melody in a language that I didn\u2019t recognize but suspected might be Yllish. Lastly he played \u201cTinker Tanner,\u201d and everyone came in on the chorus. Everyone but me.", "I sat still as stone with my fingers aching. I wanted to play, not listen. Want isn\u2019t strong enough a word. I was hungry for it, starved. I\u2019m not proud of the fact that I thought about stealing his lute and leaving in the dark of the night.", "He finished the song with a flourish, and Roent clapped his hands a couple of times to get everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cTime for sleep. You sleep too late\u2014\u201d", "Derrik broke in, gently teasing. \u201c... we get left behind. We know, Master Roent. We\u2019ll be ready to roll with the light.\u201d", "Josn laughed and flipped open his lute case with his foot. But before he could put it away I called over to him. \u201cCould I see that for a second?\u201d I tried to keep the desperation out of my voice, tried to make it sound like idle curiosity.", "I hated myself for the question. Asking to hold a musician\u2019s instrument is roughly similar to asking to kiss a man\u2019s wife. Nonmusicians don\u2019t understand. An instrument is like a companion and a lover. Strangers ask to touch and hold with annoying regularity. I knew better, but I couldn\u2019t help myself. \u201cJust for a second?\u201d", "I saw him stiffen slightly, reluctant. But keeping friendly appearances is a minstrel\u2019s business just as much as music. \u201cCertainly,\u201d he said with a jocularity that I saw as false but was probably convincing for the others. He strode over to me and held it out. \u201cBe careful ...\u201d", "Josn took a couple of steps back and gave a very good appearance of being at ease. But I saw how he stood with his arms slightly bent, ready to rush forward and whisk the lute away from me if the need arose.", "I turned it over in my hands. Objectively, it was nothing special. My father would have rated it as one short step above firewood. I touched the wood. I cradled it against my chest.", "I spoke without looking up. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d I said softly, my voice rough with emotion.", "It was beautiful. It was the most beautiful thing I had seen in three years. More beautiful than the sight of a spring field after three years of living in that pestilent cesspit of a city. More beautiful than Denna. Almost.", "I can honestly say that I was still not really myself. I was only four days away from living on the streets. I was not the same person I had been back in the days of the troupe, but neither was I yet the person you hear about in stories. I had changed because of Tarbean. I had learned many things it would have been easier to live without.", "But sitting beside the fire, bending over the lute, I felt the hard, unpleasant parts of myself that I had gained in Tarbean crack. Like a clay mold around a now-cool piece of iron they fell away, leaving something clean and hard behind.", "I sounded the strings, one at a time. When I hit the third it was ever so slightly off and I gave one of the tuning pegs a minute adjustment without thinking.", "\u201cHere now, don\u2019t go touching those,\u201d Josn tried to sound casual, \u201cyou\u2019ll turn it from true.\u201d But I didn\u2019t really hear him. The singer and all the rest couldn\u2019t have been farther away from me if they\u2019d been at the bottom of the Centhe Sea.", "I touched the last string and tuned it too, ever so slightly. I made a simple chord and strummed it. It rang soft and true. I moved a finger and the chord went minor in a way that always sounded to me as if the lute were saying sad. I moved my hands again and the lute made two chords whispering against each other. Then, without realizing what I was doing, I began to play.", "The strings felt strange against my fingers, like reunited friends who have forgotten what they have in common. I played soft and slow, sending notes no farther than the circle of our firelight. Fingers and strings made a careful conversation, as if their dance described the lines of an infatuation.", "Then I felt something inside me break and music began to pour out into the quiet. My fingers danced; intricate and quick they spun something gossamer and tremulous into the circle of light our fire had made. The music moved like a spiderweb stirred by a gentle breath, it changed like a leaf twisting as it falls to the ground, and it felt like three years Waterside in Tarbean, with a hollowness inside you and hands that ached from the bitter cold.", "I don\u2019t know how long I played. It could have been ten minutes or an hour. But my hands weren\u2019t used to the strain. They slipped and the music fell to pieces like a dream on waking.", "I looked up to see everyone perfectly motionless, their faces ranging from shock to amazement. Then, as if my gaze had broken some spell, everyone stirred. Roent shifted in his seat. The two mercenaries turned and raised eyebrows at each other. Derrik looked at me as if he had never seen me before.", "Reta remained frozen, her hand held in front of her mouth. Denna lowered her face into her hands and began to cry in quiet, hopeless sobs.", "Josn simply stood.

After a moment, unable to think of anything to say, I left them sitting by the fire and walked toward the wagons.", "And that is how Kvothe spent his last night before he came to the University, with his cloak as both his blanket and his bed. As he lay down, behind him was a circle of fire, and before him lay shadow like a mantle, gathered. His eyes were open, that much is certain, but who among us can say they know what he was seeing?", "Look behind him instead, to the circle of light that the fire has made, and leave Kvothe to himself for now. Everyone deserves a moment or two alone when they desire it. And if by chance there were tears, let us forgive him.

My mood was sullen and hurt. Denna had shared a wagon with Josn the whole of the day, and I, being foolish and proud, had kept my distance.", "A whirl of activity sprang up as soon as the wagons rolled to a stop. Roent began to argue with a clean-shaven man in a velvet hat before he had brought his wagon to a full stop. After the initial bout of bargaining, a dozen men began unloading bolts of cloth, barrels of molasses, and burlap sacks of coffee. Reta cast a stern eye over the lot of them. Josn scuttled around, trying to keep his luggage from being damaged or stolen.", "My own luggage was easier to manage, as I only had my travelsack. I retrieved it from between some bolts of cloth and moved away from the wagons. I slung it over one shoulder and looked around for Denna.", "I found Reta instead. \u201cYou were a great help on the road,\u201d she said clearly. Her Aturan was much better than Roent\u2019s, with hardly any trace of a Siaru accent at all. \u201cIt is nice to have someone along who can unhitch a horse without being led by the hand.\u201d She held out a coin to me.", "I took it without thinking. It was a reflex action from my years as a beggar. Like the reverse of jerking your hand back from a fire. Only after the coin was in my hand did I take a closer look at it. It was a whole copper jot, fully half of what I had paid to travel with them to Imre. When I looked back up, Reta was heading back toward the wagons.", "Not sure what to think, I wandered over to where Derrick sat on the edge of a horse trough. He shaded his eyes against the evening sun with one hand as he looked up at me. \u201cOn your way then? I almost thought you might stick with us for a while.\u201d", "I shook my head. \u201cReta just gave me a jot.\u201d", "He nodded. \u201cI\u2019m not terribly surprised. Most folks are nothing but dead weight.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cAnd she appreciated your playing. Have you ever thought of trying out as a minstrel? They say Imre\u2019s a good place for it.\u201d", "I steered the conversation back to Reta. \u201cI don\u2019t want Roent to be angry with her.

A man doesn\u2019t give money away.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s my point,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t want her to get in trouble.\u201d", "Derrick waved his hands back and forth, cutting me off. \u201cI\u2019m not doing a good job explaining myself,\u201d he said. \u201cRoent knows. He might have even sent her over to do it. But grown Cealdish men don\u2019t give away money. It\u2019s seen as womanish behavior. They don\u2019t even buy things if they can help it. Didn\u2019t you notice that Reta was the one who bargained for our rooms and food at the inn a few nights ago?\u201d", "I did remember, now that he mentioned it. \u201cBut why?\u201d I asked.", "Derrick shrugged. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any why. It\u2019s just the way they do things. That\u2019s why so many Cealdish caravans are husband-wife teams.\u201d", "\u201cDerrick!\u201d Roent\u2019s voice came from behind the wagons.", "He sighed as he stood up. \u201cDuty calls,\u201d he said. \u201cSee you around.\u201d", "I tucked the jot into my pocket and thought about what Derrick had said. The truth was, my troupe had never gone so far north as to make it into the Shald. It was unnerving to think I wasn\u2019t as world-wise as I\u2019d thought.", "I slung my travelsack over my shoulder and looked around one last time, thinking that perhaps it would be best if I left without any troublesome good-byes.

You could teach Josn to play that lute he carries around.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve asked him, and he\u2019s said he wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d", "I considered it. For half a heartbeat I almost threw my whole plan aside just to stay with her a little longer. But the moment passed and I shook my head.", "\u201cDon\u2019t look like that,\u201d she chided me with a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll be there for a while, if things don\u2019t work out for you here.\u201d She trailed off hopefully", "I didn\u2019t know what I could do if things didn\u2019t work out for me here. I was hanging all my hopes on the University. Besides, Anilin was hundreds of miles away. I barely owned the clothes on my back. How would I find her?", "Denna must have seen my thoughts reflected on my face. She smiled playfully \u201cI guess I\u2019ll just have to come looking for you, then.\u201d", "We Ruh are travelers. Our lives are composed of meetings and partings, with brief, bright acquaintances in-between. Because of this I knew the truth. I felt it, heavy and certain in the pit of my stomach: I would never see her again.", "Before I could say anything she looked nervously behind her. \u201cI had better go. Watch for me.\u201d She flashed her impish smile again before turning to walk away.", "\u201cI will,\u201d I called after her. \u201cI\u2019ll see you where the roads meet.\u201d", "She glanced back and hesitated for a moment, then waved and ran off into the early evening twilight.", "", "", ""], "CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX": ["CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX", "Less Talents", "\nI spent the night sleeping outside the city limits of Imre in a soft bed of heather. The next day I woke late, washed in a nearby stream, and made my way west to the University.", "As I walked, I watched the horizon for the largest building in the University. From Ben\u2019s descriptions I knew what it would look like: featureless, grey, and square as a block. Larger than four granaries stacked together. No windows, no decorations, and only one set of great stone doors. Ten times ten thousand books. The Archives.", "I had come to the University for many reasons, but that was at the heart of it. The Archives held answers, and I had many, many questions. First and foremost, I wanted to know the truth about the Chandrian and the Amyr. I needed to know how much of Skarpi\u2019s story was the truth.", "When the road crossed the Omethi River, there was an old stone bridge. I don\u2019t doubt that you know the type. It was one of those ancient, mammoth pieces of architecture scattered throughout the world, so old and solidly built that they have become part of the landscape, not a soul wondering who built them, or why This one was particularly impressive, over two hundred feet long and wide enough for two wagons to pass each other, it stretched over the canyon the Omethi had carved into the rock. When I reached the crest of the bridge I saw the Archives for the first time in my life, rising like some great greystone over the trees to the west.", "The University lay at the heart of a small city. Though truthfully, I hesitate to call it a city at all. It was nothing like Tarbean with its twisting alleys and garbage smell. It was more of a town, with wide roads and clean air. Lawns and gardens were spaced between small houses and shops.", "But since this town had grown up to serve the peculiar needs of the University, a careful observer could note small differences in the services the town provided. For instance, there were two glassblowers, three fully stocked apothecaries, two binderies, four booksellers, two brothels, and a truly disproportionate number of taverns. One of them had a large wooden sign nailed to its door proclaiming, no sympathy! I wondered what non-arcane visitors might think of the warning.", "The University itself consisted of about fifteen buildings that bore little resemblance to each other. Mews had a circular central hub with eight wings radiating in each direction so it looked like a compass rose. Hollows was simple and square, with stained glass windows showing Teccam in a classic pose: standing barefoot in the mouth of his cave, speaking to a group of students. Mains was the most distinctive building of the lot: it covered nearly an acre and a half and looked like it had been cobbled together from a number of smaller, mismatched buildings.", "As I approached the Archives, its grey, windowless surface reminded me of an immense greystone. It was hard to believe after all the years of waiting that I was finally there. I circled around it until I found the entrance, a massive pair of stone doors standing wide open. Over them, chiseled deep into the stone, were the words Vorfelan Rhinata Morie. I didn\u2019t recognize the language. It wasn\u2019t Siaru ... maybe Yllish, or Temic. Yet another question I needed answers for.", "Through the stone doors was a small antechamber with a more ordinary set of wooden doors inside. I tugged them open and felt cool, dry air brush past me. The walls were bare grey stone, lit with the distinctive unwavering reddish light of sympathy lamps. There was a large wooden desk with several large, ledger-type books lying open atop it.", "At the desk sat a young man who looked to be a full-blooded Ceald, with the characteristic ruddy complexion and dark hair and eyes.", "\u201cCan I help you?\u201d he asked, his voice thick with the harsh burr a Siaru accent makes.", "\u201cI\u2019m here for the Archives,\u201d I said stupidly My stomach was dancing with butterflies. My palms were sweaty.", "He looked me over, obviously wondering at my age. \u201cAre you a student?\u201d", "\u201cSoon,\u201d I said. \u201cI haven\u2019t been through admissions yet.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019ll need to do that first,\u201d he said seriously. \u201cI can\u2019t let anyone in unless they\u2019re in the book.\u201d He gestured at the ledgers on the desk in front of him.", "The butterflies died. I didn\u2019t bother to hide my disappointment. \u201cAre you sure I can\u2019t look around just for a couple of minutes? I\u2019ve come an awfully long way ...\u201d I looked at the two sets of double doors leading out of the room, one labeled TOMES the other stacks. Behind the desk a smaller door was labeled scrivs only.", "His expression softened somewhat. \u201cI cannot. There would be trouble.\u201d He looked me over again. \u201cAre you really going through admissions?\u201d his skepticism was obvious even through his thick accent.", "I nodded. \u201cI just came here first.\u201d I said looking around the empty room, eyeing the closed doors, trying to think of some way to persuade him to let me in.", "He spoke before I could think of anything. \u201cIf you\u2019re really going, you should hurry Today is the last day. Sometimes they don\u2019t go much longer than noon.\u201d", "My heart beat hard and quick in my chest.

Is that the word for a tree?\u201d", "I nodded and hurried outside, soon I was pelting down the road.", "", "Two hours later I was in Hollows, fighting down a sour stomach and climbing up onto the stage of an empty theater. The room was dark except for the wide circle of light that held the masters\u2019 table. I walked to stand at the edge of the light and waited. Slowly the nine masters stopped talking among themselves and turned to look at me.", "They sat at a huge, crescent-shaped table. It was raised, so even seated they were looking down on me. They were serious-looking men, ranging in age from mature to ancient.", "There was a long moment of silence before the man sitting at the center of the crescent motioned me forward. I guessed he was the Chancellor. \u201cCome up where we can see you. That\u2019s right. Hello. Now, what\u2019s your name, boy?\u201d", "\u201cKvothe, sir.\u201d", "\u201cAnd why are you here?\u201d", "I looked him in the eye. \u201cI want to attend the University. I want to be an arcanist.\u201d I looked around at each of them. Some seemed amused. None looked particularly surprised.", "\u201cYou are aware,\u201d the Chancellor said. \u201cThat the University is for continuing one\u2019s education. Not beginning it?\u201d", "\u201cYes, Chancellor. I know\u201d", "\u201cVery well,\u201d he said. \u201cMay I have your letter of introduction?\u201d", "I didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have one, sir. Is it absolutely necessary?\u201d", "\u201cIt is customary to have a sponsor,\u201d he explained. \u201cPreferably an arcanist. Their letter tells us what you know. Your areas of excellence and weakness.\u201d", "\u201cThe arcanist I learned from was named Abenthy sir. But he never gave me a letter of introduction. Might I tell you myself?\u201d", "The Chancellor nodded gravely, \u201cUnfortunately, we have no way of knowing that you actually have studied with an arcanist without proof of some kind. Do you have anything that can corroborate your story? Any other correspondence?\u201d", "\u201cHe gave me a book before we parted ways, sir. He inscribed it to me and signed his name.\u201d", "The Chancellor smiled. \u201cThat should do nicely. Do you have it with you?\u201d", "\u201cNo.\u201d I let some honest bitterness creep into my voice. \u201cI had to pawn it in Tarbean.\u201d", "Sitting to the left of the Chancellor, Master Rhetorician Hemme made a disgusted noise at my comment, earning him an irritated look from the Chancellor. \u201cCome, Herma,\u201d Hemme said, slapping his hand on the table. \u201cThe boy is obviously lying. I have important matters to attend to this afternoon.\u201d", "The Chancellor gave him a vastly irritated look. \u201cI have not given you leave to speak, Master Hemme.\u201d The two of them stared at each other for a long moment before Hemme looked away, scowling.", "The Chancellor turned back to me, then his eye caught some movement from one of the other masters. \u201cYes, Master Lorren?\u201d", "The tall, thin master looked at me passively. \u201cWhat was the book called?\u201d", "\u201cRhetoric and Logic, sir.\u201d", "\u201cAnd where did you pawn it?\u201d", "\u201cThe Broken Binding, on Seaward Square.\u201d", "Lorren turned to look at the Chancellor. \u201cI will be leaving for Tarbean tomorrow to fetch necessary materials for the upcoming term. If it is there I will bring it back. The matter of the boy\u2019s claim can be settled then.\u201d", "The Chancellor gave a small nod. \u201cThank you, Master Lorren.\u201d He settled himself back into his chair and folded his hands in front of himself. \u201cVery well, then. What would Abenthy\u2019s letter tell us, if he had written it?\u201d", "I took a good breath. \u201cHe would say that I knew by heart the first ninety sympathetic bindings. That I could double-distill, perform titration, calcify, sublimate, and precipitate solution. That I am well versed in history, argument, grammars, medicine, and geometry.\u201d", "The Chancellor did his best to not look amused. \u201cThat\u2019s quite a list. Are you sure you didn\u2019t leave anything out?\u201d", "I paused. \u201cHe probably would have also mentioned my age, sir.\u201d", "\u201cHow old are you, boy?\u201d", "\u201cKvothe, sir.\u201d", "A smile tugged at the Chancellor\u2019s face. \u201cKvothe.\u201d", "\u201cFifteen, sir.\u201d There was a rustle as the masters each took some small action, exchanged glances, raised eyebrows, shook their heads. Hemme rolled his eyes skyward.", "Only the Chancellor did nothing. \u201cHow exactly would he have mentioned your age?\u201d", "I gave a thin sliver of a smile. \u201cHe would have urged you to ignore it.\u201d", "There was a breath of silence. The Chancellor drew a deep breath and leaned back in his seat. \u201cVery well. We have a few questions for you. Would you like to begin, Master Brandeur?\u201d He made a gesture toward one end of the crescent table.", "I turned to face Brandeur. Portly and balding, he was the University\u2019s Master Arithmetician. \u201cHow many grains are in thirteen ounces?\u201d", "\u201cSix thousand two hundred and forty,\u201d I said immediately.", "He raised his eyebrows a little. \u201cIf I had fifty silver talents and converted them to Vintish coin and back, how much would I have if the Cealdim took four percent each time?\u201d", "I started the ponderous conversion between currencies, then smiled as I realized it was unnecessary. \u201cForty-six talents and eight drabs, if he\u2019s honest. Forty-six even if he\u2019s not.\u201d", "He nodded again, looking at me more closely. \u201cYou have a triangle,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cOne side is seven feet. Another side, three feet. One angle is sixty degrees. How long is the other side?\u201d", "\u201cIs the angle between the two sides?\u201d He nodded. I closed my eyes for the space of half a breath, then opened them again. \u201cSix feet six inches. Dead even.\u201d", "He made a hmmmpfh noise and looked surprised. \u201cGood enough. Master Arwyl?\u201d", "Arwyl asked his question before I had time to turn and to face him. \u201cWhat are the medicinal properties of hellebore?\u201d", "\u201cAnti-inflammatory, antiseptic, mild sedative, mild analgesic. Blood purifier.\u201d I said, looking up at the grandfatherly, spectacled old man. \u201cToxic if used excessively Dangerous for women who are with child.\u201d", "\u201cName the component structures that comprise the hand.\u201d", "I named all twenty-seven bones, alphabetically Then the muscles from largest to smallest. I listed them quickly, matter-of-factly pointing out their locations on my own upraised hand.", "The speed and accuracy of my answers impressed them. Some of them hid it, others wore it openly on their faces. The truth was, I needed to impress them. I knew from my previous discussions with Ben that you needed money or brains to get into the University. The more of one you had, the less of the other you needed.", "So I was cheating. I had snuck into Hollows through a back entrance, acting the part of an errand boy. Then I\u2019d picked two locks and spent more than an hour watching other students\u2019 interviews. I heard hundreds of questions and thousands of answers.", "I also heard how high the other students\u2019 tuitions were set. The lowest had been four talents and six jots, but most were double that. One student had been charged over thirty talents for his tuition. It would be easier for me to get a piece of the moon than that much money.", "I had two copper jots in my pocket and no way to get a bent penny more. So I needed to impress them. More than that. I needed to confound them with my intelligence. To dazzle them.", "I finished listing the muscles of the hand and started in on the ligatures when Arwyl waved me into silence and asked his next question. \u201cWhen do you bleed a patient?\u201d", "The question brought me up short. \u201cWhen I want him to die?\u201d I asked dubiously.", "He nodded, mostly to himself. \u201cMaster Lorren?\u201d", "Master Lorren was pale and seemed unnaturally tall even while sitting. \u201cWho was the first declared king of Tarvintas?\u201d", "\u201cPosthumously? Feyda Calanthis. Otherwise it would be his brother, Jarvis.\u201d", "\u201cWhy did the Aturan Empire collapse?\u201d", "I paused, taken aback by the scope of the question. None of the other students had been asked anything so broad as this. \u201cWell sir,\u201d I said slowly to give myself a moment or two to organize my thoughts. \u201cPartly because Lord Nalto was an inept egomaniac. Partly because the church went into upheaval and denounced the Order Amyr who were a large part of the strength of Atur. Partly because the military was fighting three different wars of conquest at the same time, and high taxes fomented rebellion in lands already inside the empire.\u201d", "I watched the master\u2019s expression, hoping he would give some sign when he had heard enough. \u201cThey also debased their currency, undercut the universality of the iron law, and antagonized the Adem.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cBut of course it\u2019s more complicated than that.\u201d", "Master Lorren\u2019s expression remained unchanged, but he nodded. \u201cWho was the greatest man who ever lived?\u201d", "Another unfamiliar question. I thought for a minute. \u201cIllien.\u201d", "Master Lorren blinked once, expressionless. \u201cMaster Mandrag?\u201d", "Mandrag was clean-shaven and smooth-faced, with hands stained a half hundred different colors and seemed to be made all of knuckle and bone. \u201cIf you needed phosphorus where would you get it?\u201d", "His tone sounded for a moment so much like Abenthy\u2019s that I forgot myself and spoke without thinking. \u201cAn apothecary?\u201d One of the masters on the other side of the table chuckled and I bit my too-quick tongue.", "He gave me a faint smile, and I drew a faint breath. \u201cBarring access to an apothecary.\u201d", "\u201cI could render it from urine,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cGiven a kiln and enough time.\u201d", "\u201cHow much would you need to gain two ounces pure?\u201d He cracked his knuckles absentmindedly", "I paused to consider, as this was a new question too. \u201cAt least forty gallons, Master Mandrag, depending on the quality of the material.\u201d", "There was a long pause as he cracked his knuckles one at a time. \u201cWhat are the three most important rules of the chemist?\u201d", "This I knew from Ben. \u201cLabel clearly Measure twice. Eat elsewhere.\u201d", "He nodded, still wearing the faint smile. \u201cMaster Kilvin?\u201d", "Kilvin was Cealdish, his thick shoulders and brisding black beard reminded me of a bear. \u201cRight,\u201d he grumbled, folding his thick hands in front of him. \u201cHow would you make an ever-burning lamp?\u201d", "Each of the other eight masters made some sort of exasperated noise or gesture.", "\u201cWhat?\u201d Kilvin demanded, looking around at them, irritated. \u201cIt is my question. The asking is mine.\u201d He turned his attention back to me. \u201cSo. How would you make it?\u201d", "\u201cWell,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cI would probably start with a pendulum of some sort. Then I would bind it to\u2014\u201d", "\u201cKraem. No. Not like this.\u201d Kilvin growled out a couple words and pounded his fist on the table, each thump as his hand came down was accompanied by a staccato burst of reddish light that welled up from his hand. \u201cNo sympathy. I do not want an ever-glowng lamp. I want an ever-burning one.\u201d He looked at me again showing his teeth, as if he were going to eat me.", "\u201cLithium salt?\u201d I asked without thinking, then backpedaled. \u201cNo, a sodium oil that burned in an enclosed ... no, damn.\u201d I mumbled my way to a stop. The other applicants hadn\u2019t had to deal with questions like these.", "He cut me off with a short sideways gesture of his hand. \u201cEnough. We will talk later. Elxa Dal.\u201d", "It took me a moment to remember that Elxa Dal was the next master. I turned to him. He looked like the archetypal sinister magician that seems to be a requirement in so many bad Aturan plays. Severe dark eyes, lean face, short black beard. For all that, his expression was friendly enough. \u201cWhat are the words for the first parallel kinetic binding?\u201d", "I rattled them off glibly.", "He didn\u2019t seem surprised. \u201cWhat was the binding that Master Kilvin used just a moment ago?\u201d", "\u201cCapacatorial Kinetic Luminosity.\u201d", "\u201cWhat is the synodic period?\u201d", "I looked at him oddly. \u201cOf the moon?\u201d The question seemed a little out of sync with the other two.", "He nodded.", "\u201cSeventy-two and a third days, sir. Give or take a bit.\u201d", "He shrugged and gave a wry smile, as if he\u2019d expected to catch me with the last question. \u201cMaster Hemme?\u201d", "Hemme looked at me over steepled fingers. \u201cHow much mercury would it take to reduce two gills of white sulfur?\u201d he asked pompously, as if I\u2019d already given the wrong answer.", "One of the things I\u2019d learned during my hour of quiet observation was this: Master Hemme was the king-high bastard of the lot. He took delight in student\u2019s discomfort and did everything he could to badger and unsettle them. He had a fondness for trick questions.", "Luckily, this was one I had watched him use on other students. You see, you can\u2019t reduce white sulfur with mercury. \u201cWell,\u201d I drew the word out, pretending to think it through. Hemme\u2019s smug smile grew wider by the second. \u201cAssuming you mean red sulfur, it would be about forty-one ounces. Sir.\u201d I smiled a sharp smile at him. All teeth.", "\u201cName the nine prime fallacies,\u201d he snapped.", "\u201cSimplification. Generalization. Circularity. Reduction. Analogy. False causality. Semantism. Irrelevancy....\u201dI paused, not being able to remember the formal name of the last one. Ben and I had called it Nalt, after Emperor Nalto. It galled me, not being able to recall its real name, as I had read it in Rhetoric and Logic just a few days ago.", "My irritation must have shown on my face. Hemme glowered at me as I paused, saying. \u201cSo you don\u2019t know everything after all?\u201d He leaned back into his seat with a satisfied expression.", "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here if I didn\u2019t think I had anything to learn,\u201d I said bitingly before I managed to get my tongue under control again. From the other side of the table, Kilvin gave a deep chuckle.", "Hemme opened his mouth, but the Chancellor silenced him with a look before he could say anything else. \u201cNow then,\u201d the Chancellor began, \u201cI think\u2014\u201d", "\u201cI too would ask some questions,\u201d the man to the Chancellor\u2019s right said. He had an accent that I couldn\u2019t quite place. Or perhaps it was that his voice held a certain resonance. When he spoke, everyone at the desk stirred slightly, then grew still, like leaves touched by the wind.", "\u201cMaster Namer,\u201d the Chancellor said with equal parts deference and trepidation.", "Elodin was younger than the others by at least a dozen years. Cleanshaven with deep eyes. Medium height, medium build, there was nothing particularly striking about him, except for the way he sat at the table, one moment watching something intently, the next minute bored and letting his attention wander among the high beams of the ceiling above. He was almost like a child who had been forced to sit down with adults.", "I felt Master Elodin look at me. Actually felt it, I suppressed a shiver. \u201cSo-heketh ka Siaru krema\u2019teth tu?\u201d he asked. How well do you speak Siaru?", "\u201cRieusa, ta krelar deala tu.\u201d Not very well, thank you.", "He lifted a hand, his index finger pointing upward. \u201cHow many fingers am I holding up?\u201d", "I paused for a moment, which was more consideration than the question seemed to warrant. \u201cAt least one,\u201d I said. \u201cProbably no more than six.\u201d", "He broke into a broad smile and brought his other hand up from underneath the table, it had two fingers upright. He waved them back and forth for the other masters to see, nodding his head from side to side in an absent, childish way Then he lowered his hands to the table in front of him, and grew suddenly serious. \u201cDo you know the seven words that will make a woman love you?\u201d", "I looked at him, trying to decide if there was more to the question. When nothing more was forthcoming, I answered simply, \u201cNo.\u201d", "\u201cThey exist.\u201d He reassured me, and sat back with a look of contentment. \u201cMaster Linguist?\u201d He nodded to the Chancellor.", "\u201cThat seems to cover most of academia,\u201d the Chancellor said almost to himself. I had the impression that something had unsettled him, but he was too composed for me to tell exactly what. \u201cYou will forgive me if I ask a few things of a less scholarly nature?\u201d", "Having no real choice, I nodded.", "He gave me a long look that seemed to stretch several minutes. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Abenthy send a letter of recommendation with you?\u201d", "I hesitated. Not all traveling entertainers are as respectable as our troupe, so, understandably, not everyone respected them. But I doubted that lying was the best course of action. \u201cHe left my troupe three years ago. I haven\u2019t seen him since.\u201d", "I saw each of the masters look at me. I could almost hear them doing the mental arithmetic, calculating my age backward.", "\u201cOh come now,\u201d Hemme said disgustedly and moved as if he would stand.", "The Chancellor gave him a dark look, silencing him. \u201cWhy do you wish to attend the University?\u201d", "I stood dumbfounded. It was the one question I was completely unprepared for. What could I say? Ten thousand books. Your Archives. I used to have dreams of reading there when I was young. True, but too childish. I want revenge against the Chandrian. Too dramatic. To become so powerful that no one will ever be able to hurt me again. Too frightening.", "I looked up to the Chancellor and realized I\u2019d been quiet for a long while. Unable to think of anything else, I shrugged and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, sir. I guess I\u2019ll have to learn that too.\u201d", "The Chancellor\u2019s eyes had taken on a curious look by this point but he pushed it aside as he said, \u201cIs there anything else you would like to say?\u201d He had asked the question of the other applicants, but none of them had taken advantage of it. It seemed almost rhetorical, a ritual before the masters discussed the applicant\u2019s tuition.", "\u201cYes, please,\u201d I said, surprising him. \u201cI have a favor to ask beyond mere admission.\u201d I took a deep breath, letting their attention settle on me. \u201cIt has taken me nearly three years to get here. I may seem young, but I belong here as much, if not more, than some rich lordling who can\u2019t tell salt from cyanide by tasting it.\u201d", "I paused. \u201cHowever, at this moment I have two jots in my purse and nowhere in the world to get more than that. I have nothing worth selling that I haven\u2019t already sold.", "\u201cAdmit me for more than two jots and I will not be able to attend.

Your ability to read and count left the local villagers awestruck.\u201d", "I heard the outer door open and shut behind me, but Ambrose didn\u2019t pay it any attention as he walked around to lean against the front of the desk. \u201cYour parents knew you were special so they saved up for a couple years, bought you a pair of shoes, and sewed the pig blanket into a shirt.\u201d He reached out to rub the fabric of my new clothes between his fingers.", "\u201cIt took months of walking, hundreds of miles bumping along in the backs of mule carts.

Back home you were something special. Here you\u2019re just another kid with a big mouth. So address me as Re\u2019lar, go back to your bunk, and thank whatever pagan God you pray to that we\u2019re not in Vintas.

You might think I felt betrayed, my childhood dreams of the University cruelly shattered.", "Quite the contrary It reassured me. I had been feeling rather out of my element until Ambrose let me know, in his own special way, that there wasn\u2019t much difference between the University and the streets of Tarbean.

Over the centuries it had grown slowly in all directions, engulfing smaller buildings and courtyards as it spread. It had the look of an ambitious architectural breed of lichen that was trying to cover as many acres as it could.", "It was a hard place to find your way around. Hallways took odd turns, dead-ended unexpectedly, or took long, rambling, roundabout paths. It could easily take twenty minutes to walk from one room to another, despite the fact that they were only fifty feet apart. More experienced students knew shortcuts, of course: which workrooms and lecture halls to cut through to reach your destination.", "At least one of the courtyards had been completely isolated and could only be accessed by climbing though a window. Rumor had it that there were some rooms bricked off entirely, some with students still inside. Their ghosts were rumored to walk the halls at night, bewailing their fate and complaining about the food in the Mess.", "My first class was held in Mains. Luckily, I had been warned by my bunk-mates that Mains was difficult to navigate, so despite getting lost, I still arrived with time to spare.", "When I finally found the room for my first class, I was surprised to find it resembled a small theater. Seats rose in tiered semicircles around a small raised stage. In larger cities my troupe had performed in places not unlike this one. The thought relaxed me as I found a seat in the back.", "I was a jangling mass of excitement as I watched other students slowly trickle into the room. Everyone was older than me by at least a few years. I reviewed the first thirty sympathetic bindings in my head as the theater filled with anxious students. There were perhaps fifty of us in all, making the room about three-quarters full. Some had pen and paper with hardbacks to write on. Some had wax tablets. I hadn\u2019t brought anything, but that didn\u2019t worry me overmuch. I\u2019ve always had an excellent memory.", "Master Hemme entered the room and made his way onto the stage to stand behind a large stone worktable. He looked impressive in his dark master\u2019s robes, and it was bare seconds before the whispering, shuffling theater of students hushed to silence.", "\u201cSo you want to be arcanists?\u201d he said. \u201cYou want magic like you\u2019ve heard about in bedtime stories. You\u2019ve listened to songs about Taborlin the Great. Roaring sheets of fire, magic rings, invisible cloaks, swords that never go dull, potions to make you fly\u201d He shook his head, disgusted. \u201cWell if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for, you can leave now, because you won\u2019t find it here. It doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d", "At this point a student came in, realized he was late, and moved quickly into a vacant seat. Hemme spotted him though. \u201cHello, glad you chose to attend. What is your name?\u201d", "\u201cGel,\u201d the boy said nervously. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I had a bit of a hard time ...\u201d", "\u201cGel,\u201d Hemme interrupted. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d", "Gel gaped for a moment before managing to say, \u201cFor Principles of Sympathy?\u201d", "\u201cI do not appreciate tardiness in my class. For tomorrow, you may prepare a report on the development of the sympathy clock, its differences from the previous, more arbitrary clocks that used harmonic motion, and its effect on the accurate treatment of time.\u201d", "The boy twisted in his seat. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d", "Hemme seemed satisfied with the reaction. \u201cVery well. What is sympathy, then?\u201d", "Another boy hurried in clutching a hardback. He was young, by which I mean he looked to be no more than two years older than me. Hemme stopped him before he could make it into a seat. \u201cHello there,\u201d he said in an over-courteous tone. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d", "\u201cBasil, sir,\u201d the boy stood awkwardly in the aisle. I recognized him. I had spied on his admissions interview.", "\u201cBasil, you wouldn\u2019t happen to be from Yll, would you?\u201d Hemme asked, smiling sharply.", "\u201cNo sir.\u201d", "\u201cAhhh,\u201d Hemme said, feigning disappointment. \u201cI had heard that Yllish tribes use the sun to tell time, and as such, have no true concept of punctuality. However, as you are not Yllish, I can see no excuse for being late. Can you?\u201d", "Basil\u2019s mouth worked silently for a moment, as if to make some excuse, then apparently decided better of it. \u201cNo sir.\u201d", "\u201cGood. For tomorrow, you can prepare a report on Yll\u2019s lunar calendar compared to the more accurate, civilized Aturan calendar that you should be familiar with by now. Be seated.\u201d", "Basil slunk wordlessly into a nearby seat like a whipped dog.", "Hemme gave up all pretext of lecture and lay in wait for the next tardy student. Thus it was that the hall was tensely silent when she stepped hesitantly into the room.", "It was a young woman of about eighteen. A rarity of sorts. The ratio of men to women in the University is about ten to one.", "Hemme\u2019s manner softened when she entered the room. He moved quickly up the steps to greet her. \u201cAh, my dear. I am suddenly pleased that we have not yet begun today\u2019s discussion.\u201d He took her by the elbow and led her down a few of the steps to the first available seat.", "She was obviously embarrassed by the attention. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Master Hemme. Mains is bigger than I\u2019d guessed.\u201d", "\u201cNo worry,\u201d Hemme said in a kindly fashion. \u201cYou\u2019re here and that\u2019s what matters.\u201d He solicitously helped her arrange her paper and ink before returning to the stage.", "Once there, it seemed as if he might actually lecture. But before he began he looked back to the girl. \u201cI\u2019m sorry miss.\u201d She was the only woman in the room. \u201cPoor manners on my part. What is your name?\u201d", "\u201cRia.\u201d", "\u201cRia, is that short for Rian?\u201d", "\u201cYes, it is,\u201d she smiled.", "\u201cRian, would you please cross your legs?\u201d", "The request was made with such an earnest tone that not even a titter escaped the class. Looking puzzled, Rian crossed her legs.", "\u201cNow that the gates of hell are closed,\u201d Hemme said in his normal, rougher tones. \u201cWe can begin.\u201d", "And so he did, ignoring her for the rest of the lecture. Which, as I see it, was an inadvertent kindness.", "It was a long two and a half hours. I listened attentively, always hoping that he would come to something I hadn\u2019t learned from Abenthy. But there was nothing. I quickly realized that while Hemme was discussing the principles of sympathy, he was doing it at a very, very basic level. This class was a colossal waste of my time.", "After Hemme dismissed the class I ran down the stairs and caught him just as he was leaving through a lower door. \u201cMaster Hemme?\u201d", "He turned to face me. \u201cOh yes, our boy prodigy. I wasn\u2019t aware you were in my class. I didn\u2019t go too fast for you, did I?\u201d", "I knew better than to answer that honestly. \u201cYou covered the basics very clearly, sir. The principles you mentioned today will lay a good foundation for the other students in the class.\u201d Diplomacy is a large part of being a trouper.", "He puffed up a bit at my perceived compliment, then looked more closely at me. \u201cOther students?\u201d He asked.", "\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m already familiar with the basics, sir. I know the three laws and the fourteen corollaries. As well as the first ninety\u2014\u201d", "\u201cYes, yes. I see,\u201d he cut me off. \u201cI\u2019m rather busy right at the moment. We can speak of this tomorrow, before class.\u201d He turned and walked briskly away.", "Half a loaf being better than none, I shrugged and headed for the Archives. If I wasn\u2019t going to learn anything from Hemme\u2019s lectures, I might as well start educating myself.", "", "This time when I entered the Archives there was a young woman sitting behind the desk. She was strikingly beautiful with long, dark hair and clear, bright eyes. A notable improvement over Ambrose to be sure.", "She smiled as I approached the desk. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d", "\u201cKvothe,\u201d I said. \u201cSon of Arliden.\u201d", "She nodded and began to page through the ledger.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s yours?\u201d I asked to fill the silence.", "\u201cFela,\u201d she said without looking up. Then nodded to herself and tapped the ledger. \u201cThere you are, go on in.\u201d", "There were two sets of double doors leading out of the antechamber, one marked stacks and the other tomes. Not knowing the difference between the two, I headed to the ones labeled stacks. That was what I wanted. Stacks of books. Great heaps of books. Shelf after endless shelf of books.", "I had my hands on the handles of the doors before Fela\u2019s voice stopped me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s your first time in here, isn\u2019t it?\u201d", "I nodded, not letting go of the door\u2019s handles. I was so close. What was going to happen now?", "\u201cThe stacks are Arcanum only.\u201d She said apologetically. She stood up and walked around the desk to the other set of doors. \u201cHere, let me show you.\u201d", "I reluctantly let go of the door\u2019s handles and followed her.", "Using both hands, she tugged one of the heavy wooden doors open, revealing a large, high-ceilinged room filled with long tables. A dozen students were scattered throughout the room, reading. The room was well-lit with the unwavering light of dozens of sympathy lamps.", "Fela leaned close to me and spoke in a soft voice. \u201cThis is the main reading area. You\u2019ll find all the necessary tomes used for most of the basic classes.\u201d She blocked the door open with her foot and pointed along one wall to a long section of shelving with three or four hundred books. More books than I had ever seen in one place before.", "Fela continued to speak softly \u201cIt\u2019s a quiet place. No talking above a whisper.\u201d I\u2019d noticed that the room was almost unnaturally quiet. \u201cIf you want a book that isn\u2019t there, you can submit a request at the desk,\u201d she pointed. \u201cThey\u2019ll find the book and bring it out to you.\u201d", "I turned to ask her a question, and only then realized how close she was standing. It says a great deal about how enamored I was with the Archives that I failed to notice one of the most attractive women in the University standing less than six inches away. \u201cHow long does it usually take them to find a book?\u201d I asked quietly, trying not to stare at her.", "\u201cIt varies,\u201d she brushed her long black hair back over her shoulder. \u201cSometimes we\u2019re busier than others. Some people are better at finding the appropriate books.\u201d She shrugged and some of her hair swung back down to brush against my arm. \u201cUsually no more than an hour.\u201d", "I nodded, disappointed by not being able to browse the whole of the Archives, but still excited to be inside. Once again, half a loaf was better than none. \u201cThanks, Fela.\u201d I went inside, and she let the door swing shut behind me.", "But she came after me just a moment later. \u201cOne last thing,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI mean, it goes without saying, but this is your first time here....\u201d Her expression was serious. \u201cThe books don\u2019t leave this room. Nothing leaves the Archives.\u201d", "\u201cOf course,\u201d I said. \u201cNaturally.\u201d I hadn\u2019t known.", "Fela smiled and nodded. \u201cI just wanted to make sure. A couple of years ago we had a young gent who was used to carrying off books from his father\u2019s library. I\u2019d never even seen Lorren frown before that, or talk much above a whisper. But when he caught that boy in the street with one of his books....\u201d She shook her head as if she couldn\u2019t hope to explain what she had seen.", "I tried to picture the tall, somber master angry and failed. \u201cThanks for the warning.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t mention it.\u201d Fela headed back out into the entrance hall.", "I approached the desk she had pointed out to me. \u201cHow do I request a book?\u201d I asked the scriv quietly", "He showed me a large log book half filled with student\u2019s names and their requests. Some were requests for books with specific titles or authors, but others were more general requests for information. One of the entries caught my eye: \u201cBasil\u2014Yllish lunar calendar. History of Aturan calendar.\u201d I looked around the room and saw the boy from Hemme\u2019s class hunched over a book, taking notes.", "I wrote: \u201cKvothe\u2014The history of the Chandrian. Reports of the Chandrian and their signs: black eyes, blue flame, etc.\u201d", "I went to the shelves next and started looking over the books. I recognized one or two from my studies with Ben. The only sound in the room was the occasional scratch of a pen on paper, or the faint, bird-wing sound of a page turning. Rather than being unsettling, I found the quiet strangely comforting. Later I was to find out that the place was nicknamed \u201cTombs\u201d because of its cryptlike quiet.", "Eventually a book called The Mating Habits of the Common Draccus caught my eye and I took it over to one of the reading tables. I picked it because it had a rather stylish embossed dragon on the cover, but when I started reading I discovered it was an educated investigation into several common myths.", "I was halfway through the title piece explaining how the myth of the dragon in all likelihood evolved from the much more mundane draccus when a scriv appeared at my elbow. \u201cKvothe?\u201d I nodded and he handed me a small book with a blue cloth cover.", "Opening it, I was instantly disappointed. It was a collection of faerie stories. I flipped through it, hoping to find something useful, but it was filled with sticky-sweet adventure stories meant to amuse children. You know the sort: brave orphans trick the Chandrian, win riches, marry princesses, and live happily ever after.", "I sighed and closed the book. I had half expected this. Until the Chandrian killed my family, I thought they were nothing more than children\u2019s stories too. This sort of search wasn\u2019t going to get me anywhere.", "After walking to the desk I thought for a long moment before writing a new line in the request-ledger: \u201cKvothe\u2014The history of the Order Amyr. The origins of the Amyr. The practices of the Amyr.\u201d I reached the end of the line and rather than start another one I stopped and looked up at the scriv behind the desk. \u201cI\u2019ll take anything on the Amyr, really,\u201d I said.", "\u201cWe\u2019re a little busy right now,\u201d he said, gesturing to the room. Another dozen or so students had filtered in since I had arrived. \u201cBut we\u2019ll bring something out to you as soon as we can.\u201d", "I returned to the table and flipped through the children\u2019s book again before abandoning it for the bestiary. The wait was much longer this time, and I was learning about the strange summer hibernation of Susquinian when I felt a light touch on my shoulder. I turned, expecting to see a scriv with an armload of books, or maybe Basil come to say hello. I was startled by the sight of Master Lorren looming over me in his dark master\u2019s robes.", "\u201cCome,\u201d he said softly, and gestured for me to follow.", "Not knowing what might be the matter, I followed him out of the reading room. We walked behind the scriv\u2019s desk and down a flight of stairs to a small featureless room with a table and two chairs. The Archives was filled with little rooms like this, reading holes, designed to give members of the Arcanum a place to sit privately and study.", "Lorren lay the request-ledger from Tomes on the table. \u201cI noticed your request while assisting one of the newer scrivs in his duties,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have an interest in the Chandrian and the Amyr?\u201d he asked.", "I nodded.", "\u201cIs this in regard to an assignment from one of your instructors?\u201d", "For a moment I thought about telling him the truth. About what had happened to my parents. About the story I had heard in Tarbean.", "But Manet\u2019s reaction to my mention of the Chandrian had shown me how foolish that would be. Until I\u2019d seen the Chandrian myself, I didn\u2019t believe in them. If anyone would have claimed to have seen them, I would have thought they were crazy.", "At best Lorren would think I was delusional, at worst, a foolish child. I was suddenly pointedly aware of the fact that I was standing in one of the cornerstones of civilization, talking to the Master Archivist of the University.", "It put things in a new perspective for me. The stories of an old man in some Dockside tavern suddenly seemed very far away and insignificant.", "I shook my head. \u201cNo sir. It\u2019s merely to satisfy my curiosity.\u201d", "\u201cI have a great respect for curiosity,\u201d Lorren said with no particular inflection. \u201cPerhaps I can satisfy yours a bit. The Amyr were a part of the church back when the Aturan Empire was still strong. Their credo was Ivare Enim Euge which roughly translates as \u2018for the greater good.\u2019 They were equal part knight-errant and vigilante. They had judiciary powers, and could act as judges in both the religious and secular courts. All of them, to varying degrees, were exempt from the law.\u201d", "I knew most of this already. \u201cBut where did they come from?\u201d I asked. It was as close as I dared come to mentioning Skarpi\u2019s story.", "\u201cThey evolved from traveling judges,\u201d Lorren said. \u201cMen who went from town to town, bringing the rule of law to small Aturan towns.\u201d", "\u201cThey originated in Atur then?\u201d", "He looked at me. \u201cWhere else would they have originated?\u201d", "I couldn\u2019t bring myself to tell him the truth: that because of an old man\u2019s story I suspected the Amyr might have roots much older than the Aturan Empire. That I hoped they might still exist somewhere in the world today.", "Lorren took my silence as a response. \u201cA piece of advice,\u201d he said gently. \u201cThe Amyr are dramatic figures. When we are young we all pretend to be Amyr and fight battles with willow-switch swords. It is natural for boys to be attracted to those stories.\u201d He met my eyes. \u201cHowever, a man, an arcanist, must focus himself on the present day. He must attend to practical things.\u201d", "He held my eyes as he continued to speak. \u201cYou are young. Many will judge you by that fact alone.\u201d I drew a breath, but he held up a hand. \u201cI am not accusing you of engaging in boyish fancy. I am advising you to avoid the appearance of boyish fancy.\u201d He gave me a level look, his face as calm as always.", "I thought of the way Ambrose had treated me and nodded, feeling color rise to my cheeks.", "Lorren brought out a pen and drew a series of hashes through my single line of writing in the ledger book. \u201cI have a great respect for curiosity,\u201d he said. \u201cBut others do not think as I do. I would not see your first term unnecessarily complicated by such things. I expect things will be difficult enough for you without that additional worry.\u201d", "I bowed my head, feeling as if I\u2019d somehow disappointed him. \u201cI understand.

I only hope that I can help him shed some light on this most important subject.\u201d", "Having started this little game, Hemme was unable to stop it without looking foolish. As he shook my hand he gave me the look a wolf gives a treed cat. Smiling to himself, he left the stage to assume my recently vacated seat in the front row.

First, his general stupidity in not believing what I had told him", "the day before. Second, his desire to see me embarrassed as thoroughly as possible.", "Plainly said, he was giving me enough rope to hang myself with.

I\u2019d told him so. And Ben had taught me about the Alar, the riding-crop belief, back when I was twelve.", "But I didn\u2019t bother with either.

It might have gotten worse if I hadn\u2019t made a slight gesture over the brazier with the wax doll.

I felt an irrepressible grin bubble onto my face.", "\u201cAt least a span,\u201d he muttered. The Chancellor put his face into his hands and rubbed, then looked up and surprised me with a wry smile. I realized he wasn\u2019t particularly old when his face wasn\u2019t locked in a stern expression. Probably only on the far side of forty. \u201cYou don\u2019t look like someone who knows he\u2019s going to be whipped tomorrow,\u201d he observed.", "I pushed the thought aside. \u201cI imagine I\u2019ll heal, sir.\u201d He gave me an odd look, it took me a while to recognize it as the one I\u2019d grown accustomed to in the troupe. He opened his mouth to speak, but I jumped on the words before he could say them. \u201cI\u2019m not as young as I look, sir. I know it.

He instructed me to pack up my things, explaining that Arcanum students were located in the west wing.", "Everything I owned still fit neatly into my travelsack, so it was no great chore. As the steward led me away there was a chorus of good-byes from my fellow first-term students.", "The west wing bunks were similar to those I had left behind. It was still rows of narrow beds, but here they weren\u2019t stacked two high. Each bed had a small wardrobe and desk in addition to a trunk. Nothing fancy, but definitely a step up.", "The biggest difference was in the attitudes of my bunkmates. There were scowls and glares, though for the most part I was pointedly ignored. It was a chilly reception, especially in light of the welcome I had just received from my non-Arcanum bunkmates.", "It was easy to understand why. Most students attend the University for several terms before being admitted into the Arcanum. Everyone here had worked their way up through the ranks the hard way I hadn\u2019t.", "Only about three quarters of the bunks were full. I picked one in the back corner, away from the others. I hung my one extra shirt and my cloak in the wardrobe and put my travelsack in the trunk at the foot of my bed.", "I lay down and stared at the ceiling.

Too anxious to think of doing anything productive, I simply sat and enjoyed the weather, watching the wind tumble a few scraps of wastepaper along the cobblestones.", "It wasn\u2019t too long before Wilem strolled over and sat himself next to me without an invitation.

Coterie?\u201d", "I nodded, and Wilem looked vaguely self-satisfied. Then he frowned. \u201cThat makes me remember something strange in your language.

Wilem pointed out a few more notable buildings, including several good taverns, the alchemy complex, the Cealdish laundry, and both the sanctioned and unsanctioned brothels. We strolled past the featureless stone walls of the Archives, past a cooper, a bookbinder, an apothecary....", "A thought occurred to me. \u201cDo you know much herb lore?\u201d", "He shook his head. \u201cChemistry mostly, and I dapple in the Archives with Puppet sometimes.\u201d", "\u201cDabble,\u201d I said, emphasizing the huh sound for him. \u201cDapple is something else.

Could you do me a favor?\u201d He nodded and I pointed to the nearby apothecary. \u201cGo buy me two scruples of nahlrout.\u201d I held up two iron drabs. \u201cThis should cover it.\u201d", "\u201cWhy me?\u201d he asked warily.", "\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want the fellow in there giving me the \u2018you\u2019re awfully young\u2019 look.\u201d I frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to deal with that today.\u201d", "I was nearly dancing with anxiety by the time Wilem got back. \u201cHe was busy,\u201d he explained, seeing the impatient expression on my face. He handed me a small paper packet and a loose jingle of change. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s to settle my stomach,\u201d I said. \u201cBreakfast isn\u2019t sitting too well, and I don\u2019t fancy throwing up halfway through being whipped.\u201d", "I bought us cider at a nearby pub, using mine to wash down the nahlrout, trying not to grimace at the bitter, chalky taste. Before too long we heard the belling tower striking noon.", "\u201cI think I must go to class,\u201d Wil tried to mention it nonchalantly, but it came out almost strangled.

I walked steadily toward the pennant pole amid a sea of susurrus murmurings. I didn\u2019t carry myself proudly, as I knew that might turn them against me. I was not repentant, either. I carried myself well, as my father had taught me, with neither fear nor regret on my face.", "As I walked, I felt the nahlrout begin to take firm hold of me. I felt perfectly awake while everything around me grew almost painfully bright. Time seemed to slow as I approached the center of the courtyard. As my feet came down on the cobblestones I watched the small puffs of dust they raised. I felt a breath of wind catch the hem of my cloak and curl underneath to cool the sweat between my shoulder blades. It seemed for a second that, should I wish to, I could count the faces in the crowd around me, like flowers in a field.", "I spotted none of the masters in the crowd except for Hemme. He stood near the pennant pole, looking piglike in his smugness. He folded his arms in front of himself, letting the sleeves of his black master\u2019s robe hang loosely at his sides. He caught my eye and his mouth quirked up into a soft smirk that I knew was meant for me.", "I resolved that I would bite out my own tongue before I gave him the satisfaction of appearing frightened, or even concerned. Instead I gave him a wide, confident smile then looked away, as if he didn\u2019t concern me in the least.", "Then I was at the pennant pole. I heard someone reading something, but the words were just a vague buzzing to me as I removed my cloak and lay it across the back of a stone bench that sat at the base of the pole. Then I began to unbutton my shirt, as casually as if I were preparing to take a bath.", "A hand on my wrist stopped me. The man that had read the announcement gave me a smile that tried to be comforting. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to go shirtless,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll save you from a bit of the sting.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not going to ruin a perfectly good shirt,\u201d I said.", "He gave me an odd look, then shrugged and ran a length of rope through an iron ring above our heads. \u201cI\u2019ll need your hands.\u201d", "I gave him a flat look. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about my running off.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s to keep you from falling over if you pass out.\u201d", "I gave him a hard look. \u201cIf I pass out you may do whatever you wish,\u201d I said firmly \u201cUntil then, I will not be tied.\u201d", "Something in my voice gave him pause.

Smooth and cool, I found it oddly comforting. I focused on it as I lowered myself into the Heart of Stone.", "I heard people moving away from the base of the pole. Then the crowd quieted and there was no sound but the soft hiss and crack of the whip being loosened behind me. I was relieved I was to be whipped with a single headed whip. In Tarbean I had seen the terrible bloody hash a six-tail can make of a man\u2019s back.", "There was a sudden hush. Then, before I could brace myself, there came a sharper crack than the ones before. I felt a line of dim red fire trace down my back.", "I gritted my teeth. But it wasn\u2019t as bad as I\u2019d thought it would be. Even with the precautions I had taken, I expected a sharper, fiercer pain.", "Then the second lash came. Its crack was louder, and I heard it through my body rather than with my ears. I felt an odd looseness across my back. I held my breath, knowing I was torn and bleeding. Everything went red for a moment and I leaned against the rough, tarred wood of the pennant pole.", "The third lash came before I was ready for it. It licked up to my left shoulder, then tore nearly all the way down to my left hip. I grit my teeth, refusing to make a sound. I kept my eyes open and watched the world grow black around the edges for a moment before snapping back into sharp, bright focus.", "Then, ignoring the burning across my back, I set my feet on the bench and loosened my clenched fingers from the iron ring.

I\u2019m younger than everyone, and a lot of people think I don\u2019t belong. I upset a lot of students by getting into the Arcanum so quickly. And I\u2019ve managed to get on the wrong side of Master Hemme. All those students, and Hemme, and his friends, they\u2019re all watching me, waiting for some sign of weakness.\u201d", "I took a deep breath. \u201cI took the nahlrout because I didn\u2019t want to faint. I needed to let them know they couldn\u2019t hurt me. I\u2019ve learned that the best way to stay safe is to make your enemies think you can\u2019t be hurt.\u201d It sounded ugly to say it so starkly, but it was the truth. I looked at him defiantly", "There was a long silence as Arwyl looked at me, his eyes narrowing slightly behind his spectacles, as if he were trying to see something inside me. He brushed his upper lip with his finger again before he began, slowly, to speak.", "\u201cI suppose if I were older,\u201d he said, quietly enough to be speaking to himself, \u201cI would say that you were being ridiculous. That our students are adults, not squabbling, bickersome boys.\u201d", "He paused again, still stroking his lip absentmindedly. Then his eyes crinkled upward around the edges as he smiled at me. \u201cBut I am not so old as that. Hmmm. Not yet. Not by half. Anyone who thinks boys are innocent and sweet has never been a boy himself, or has forgotten it. And anyone who thinks men aren\u2019t hurtful and cruel at times must not leave his house often. And he has certainly never been a physicker. We see the effects of cruelty more than any other.\u201d", "Before I could respond he said, \u201cClose your mouth, E\u2019lir Kvothe, or I will feel obliged to put some vile tonic in it. Ahhh, here they come.\u201d The last was said to two students entering the room, one was the same assistant who had shown me here, the other was, surprisingly, a young woman.", "\u201cAh, Re\u2019lar Mola,\u201d Arwyl enthused, all signs of our serious discussion passing lightly from his face. \u201cYou have heard that your patient has two straight, clean lacerations. What have you brought to remedy the situation?\u201d", "\u201cBoiled linen, hook needle, gut, alcohol, and iodine,\u201d she said, crisply. She had green eyes that stood out in her pale face.", "\u201cWhat?\u201d Arwyl demanded. \u201cNo sympathy wax?\u201d", "\u201cNo, Master Arwyl,\u201d she responded, paling a little at his tone.", "\u201cAnd why not?\u201d", "She hesitated. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t need it.\u201d", "Arwyl seemed mollified. \u201cYes. Of course you don\u2019t. Very good. Did you wash before you came here?\u201d", "Mola nodded, her short blond hair bobbing with the motion of her head.", "\u201cThen you have wasted your time and effort,\u201d he said sternly. \u201cThink of all the germs of disease that you might have gathered in the long walk through the passageway. Wash again and we will begin.\u201d", "She washed with a thorough briskness at a nearby basin. Arwyl helped me lay facedown on the table.", "\u201cHas the patient been numbed?\u201d she asked. Though I couldn\u2019t see her face, I heard a shadow of doubt in her voice.", "\u201cAnesthetized,\u201d Arwyl corrected. \u201cYou have a good eye for detail, Mola. No, he has not. Now, what would you do if E\u2019lir Kvothe reassured you that that he has no need for such things? He claims to have self-control like a bar of Ramston steel and will not flinch when you stitch him.\u201d Arwyl\u2019s tone was serious, but I could detect a hint of amusement hiding underneath.", "Mola looked at me, then back to Arwyl. \u201cI would tell him that he was being foolish,\u201d she said after a brief pause.", "\u201cAnd if he persisted in his claims that he needed no numbing agent?\u201d", "There was a longer pause from Mola. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to be bleeding much at all, so I would proceed. I would also make it clear to him that if he moved overmuch, I would tie him to the table and treat him as I saw fit for his well-being.\u201d", "\u201cHmmm,\u201d Arwyl seemed a little surprised at her response. \u201cYes. Very good. So, Kvothe, do you still wish to forgo an anesthetic?\u201d", "\u201cThank you,\u201d I said politely. \u201cI do not need one.\u201d", "\u201cVery well,\u201d Mola said, as if resigning herself. \u201cFirst we will clean and sterilize the wound.\u201d The alcohol stung, but that was the worst of it. I tried my best to relax as Mola talked her way through the procedure. Arwyl kept up a steady stream of comments and advice. I occupied my mind with other things and tried not to twitch at the nahlrout-dulled jabs of the needle.", "She finished quickly and proceeded to bandage me with a quick efficiency I admired. As she helped me to a sitting position and wound linen around me, I wondered if all Arwyl\u2019s students were as well-trained as this one.", "She was making her final knots behind me when I felt a vague, featherlike touch on my shoulder, almost insensible through the nahlrout that numbed me. \u201cHe has lovely skin.\u201d I heard her muse, presumably to Arwyl.", "\u201cRe\u2019lar!\u201d Arwyl said severely. \u201cSuch comments are not professional. I am disappointed by your lack of sense.\u201d", "\u201cI was referring to the nature of the scar he can expect to have,\u201d she responded scathingly. \u201cI imagine it will be little more than a pale line, provided he can avoid tearing open his wound.\u201d", "\u201cHmmm,\u201d Arwyl said. \u201cYes, of course. And how should he avoid that?\u201d", "Mola walked around to stand in front of me. \u201cAvoid motions like this,\u201d she extended her hands in front of her, \u201cor this,\u201d she held them high over her head. \u201cAvoid over-quick motions of any kind\u2014running, jumping, climbing. The bandage may come off in two days. Do not get it wet.\u201d She looked away from me, to Arwyl.", "He nodded. \u201cVery good, Re\u2019lar. You are dismissed.\u201d He looked at the younger boy who had watched mutely throughout the procedure, \u201cYou may go as well, Geri. If anyone asks, I will be in my study. Thank you.\u201d", "In a moment Arwyl and I were alone again. He stood motionless, one hand covering his mouth as I eased my way carefully into my shirt. Finally, he seemed to reach a decision, \u201cE\u2019lir Kvothe, would you like to study here at the Medica?\u201d", "\u201cVery much so, Master Arwyl,\u201d I said honestly.", "He nodded to himself, hand still held against his lips, \u201cCome back in four days. If you are clever enough to keep from tearing out your stitches, I will have you here.\u201d His eyes twinkled.", "", "", ""], "CHAPTER FORTY-THREE": ["CHAPTER FORTY-THREE", "The Flickering Way", "\nBuoyed by the stimulant effects of the nahlrout and feeling very little pain, I made my way to the Archives.

That meant I could research the Chandrian and the Amyr to my heart\u2019s content, and no one, not even Lorren, need ever know about my \u201cchildish\u201d pursuits.", "Entering the reddish light of the Archives I found both Ambrose and Fela sitting behind the entry desk. A mixed blessing if ever there was one.", "Ambrose was leaning toward her, speaking in a low voice. She had the distinctly uncomfortable look of a woman who knows the futility of a polite refusal. One of his hands rested on her knee, while the other arm was draped across the back of her chair, his hand resting on her neck. He meant for it to look tender and affectionate, but there was a tension in her body like that of a startled deer. The truth was he was holding her there, the same way you hold a dog by the scruff of its neck to keep it from running off.", "As the door thumped closed behind me Fela looked up, met my eyes, then looked down and away, ashamed by her predicament. As if she\u2019d done anything. I had seen that look too many times on the streets of Tarbean. It sparked an old anger in me.", "I approached the desk, making more noise than necessary. Pen and ink lay on the other end of the desk, and a piece of paper three-quarters full of rewriting and crossing out. From the looks of things, Ambrose had been trying to compose a poem.", "I reached the edge of the desk and stood for a moment. Fela looked everywhere except at me or Ambrose. She shifted in her seat, uncomfortable, but obviously not wanting to make a scene. I cleared my throat pointedly.", "Ambrose looked over his shoulder, scowling. \u201cYou have damnable timing, E\u2019lir. Come back later.\u201d He turned away again, dismissing me.", "I snorted and leaned over the desk, craning my neck to look at the sheet of paper he\u2019d left lying there, \u201cI have damnable timing? Please, you have thirteen syllables in a line here.\u201d I tapped a finger onto the page. \u201cIt\u2019s not iambic either. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s anything metrical at all.\u201d", "He turned to look at me again, his expression irritated. \u201cMind your tongue, E\u2019lir.

It practically mocks itself.\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you know of poetry?\u201d Ambrose said without bothering to turn around.", "\u201cI know a limping verse when I hear it,\u201d I said. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t even limping. A limp has rhythm. This is more like someone falling down a set of stairs. Uneven stairs. With a midden at the bottom.\u201d", "\u201cIt is a sprung rhythm,\u201d he said, his voice stiff and offended. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect you to understand.\u201d", "\u201cSprung?\u201d I burst out with an incredulous laugh. \u201cI understand that if I saw a horse with a leg this badly \u2018sprung,\u2019 I\u2019d kill it out of mercy, then burn its poor corpse for fear the local dogs might gnaw on it and die.\u201d", "Ambrose finally turned around to face me, and in so doing he had to take his right hand off Fela\u2019s knee. A half-victory, but his other hand remained on her neck, holding her in her chair with the appearance of a casual caress.", "\u201cI thought you might stop by today,\u201d he said with a brittle cheerfulness. \u201cSo I already checked the ledger. You\u2019re not in the lists yet. You\u2019ll have to stick with Tomes or come back later, after they\u2019ve updated the books.\u201d", "\u201cNo offense, but would you mind checking again?

I wanted to do some research. Find a book or two on the subject.\u201d I struck the ledger with two fingers, hard. \u201cSo look up my name and let me in.\u201d", "Ambrose flipped the book open, found the proper page, and turned the book around to face me. \u201cThere. If you can find your name on that list, you are welcome to peruse the stacks at your leisure.\u201d He gave a tight smile. \u201cOtherwise feel free to come back in a span or so. We should have things updated by then.\u201d", "\u201cI had the masters send along a note just in case there was any confusion about my admission to the Arcanum.\u201d I said, and drew my shirt up over my head, turning so he could see the broad expanse of bandages covering my back. \u201cCan you read it from there, or do I need to come closer?\u201d", "There was a pointed silence from Ambrose, so I lowered my shirt and turned to face Fela, ignoring him entirely. \u201cMy lady scriv,\u201d I said to her with a bow. A very slight bow, as my back wouldn\u2019t permit a deep one. \u201cWould you be so good as to help me locate a book concerning women? I have been instructed by my betters to inform myself on this most subtle subject.\u201d", "Fela gave a faint smile and relaxed a bit. She had continued sitting stiff and uncomfortable after Ambrose had taken his hand away. I guessed that she knew Ambrose\u2019s temperament well enough to know that if she bolted away and embarrassed him, he would make her pay for it later. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we have anything like that.\u201d", "\u201cI would settle for a primer,\u201d I said with a smile. \u201cI have it on good report that I don\u2019t know the first thing about them, so anything would further my knowledge.\u201d", "\u201cSomething with pictures?\u201d Ambrose spat.", "\u201cIf our search degenerates to that level I\u2019ll be sure to call on you,\u201d I said without looking in his direction. I smiled at Fela. \u201cPerhaps a bestiary,\u201d I said gently. \u201cI hear they are singular creatures, much different than men.\u201d", "Fela\u2019s smile blossomed and she gave a small laugh. \u201cWe could have a look around, I suppose.\u201d", "Ambrose scowled in her direction.", "She made a placating gesture toward him. \u201cEveryone knows he\u2019s in the Arcanum, Ambrose,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the harm of just letting him in?\u201d", "Ambrose glared at her. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you run along to Tomes and play the good little fetch-and-carry girl?\u201d he said coldly. \u201cI can handle things out here by myself.\u201d", "Moving stiffly, Fela got up from the desk, gathered up the book she\u2019d been trying to read, and headed into Tomes. As she pulled the door open, I like to think she gave me a brief look of gratitude and relief. But perhaps it was only my imagination.", "As the door swung shut behind her, the room seemed to grow a little dimmer. I am not speaking poetically. The light truly seemed to dim. I looked at the sympathy lamps hanging around the room, wondering what was wrong.", "But a moment later I felt a slow, burning sensation begin to creep across my back and realized the truth. The nahlrout was wearing off.", "Most powerful painkillers have serious side effects. Tennasin occasionally produces delirium or fainting. Lacillium is poisonous. Ophalum is highly addictive. Mhenka is perhaps the most powerful of all, but there are reasons they call it \u201cdevil root.\u201d", "Nahlrout was less powerful than these, but much safer. It was a mild anesthetic, a stimulant, and a vascular constrictor, which is why I hadn\u2019t bled like a stuck pig when they\u2019d whipped me. Best of all, it had no major side effects. Still, there is always a price to be paid. Once nahlrout wears off, it leaves you physically and mentally exhausted.", "Regardless, I had come here to see the stacks. I was now a member of the Arcanum and I didn\u2019t intend to leave until I\u2019d been inside the Archives. I turned back to the desk, my expression resolute.", "Ambrose gave me a long, calculating look before heaving a sigh. \u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cHow about a deal? You keep quiet about what you saw here today, and I\u2019ll bend the rules and let you in even though you aren\u2019t officially in the book.\u201d He looked a little nervous. \u201cHow does that sound?\u201d", "Even as he spoke I could feel the stimulant effect from the nahlrout fading. My body felt heavy and tired, my thoughts grew sluggish and syrupy. I reached up to rub at my face with my hands, and winced as the motion tugged sharply at the stitches all across my back. \u201cThat\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I said thickly.", "Ambrose opened up one of the ledger books and sighed as he turned the pages. \u201cSince this is your first time in the Archives proper, you\u2019ll have to pay the stack fee.\u201d", "My mouth tasted strangely of lemons. That was a side effect Ben had never mentioned. It was distracting, and after a moment I saw that Ambrose was looking up at me expectantly. \u201cWhat?\u201d", "He gave me a strange look. \u201cThe stack fee.\u201d", "\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any fee before,\u201d I said. \u201cWhen I was in the Tomes.\u201d", "Ambrose looked up at me as if I were an idiot. \u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s the stack fee.\u201d He looked back down at the ledger. \u201cNormally you pay it in addition to your first term\u2019s Arcanum tuition. But since you\u2019ve jumped rank on us, you\u2019ll need to tend to it now.\u201d", "\u201cHow much is it?\u201d I asked, feeling for my purse.", "\u201cOne talent,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you do have to pay before you can go in. Rules are Rules.\u201d", "After paying for my bunk in Mews, a talent was nearly all my remaining money. I was keenly aware of the fact that I needed to hoard my resources to save for next term\u2019s tuition. As soon as I couldn\u2019t pay, I would have to leave the University.", "Still, it was a small price to pay for something I\u2019d dreamed about for most of my life. I pulled a talent out of my purse and handed it over. \u201cDo I need to sign in?\u201d", "\u201cNothing so formal as that,\u201d Ambrose said as he opened a drawer and pulled out a small metal disk. Stupefied from the side effects of the nahlrout, it took me a moment to recognize it for what it was: a handheld sympathy lamp.", "\u201cThe Stacks aren\u2019t lit,\u201d Ambrose said matter-of-factly \u201cThere\u2019s too much space in there, and it would be bad for the books in the long term. Hand lamps cost a talent and a half\u201d", "I hesitated.", "Ambrose nodded to himself and looked thoughtful. \u201cA lot of folk end up strapped during first term.\u201d He reached down into a lower drawer and rooted around for a long moment. \u201cHand lamps are a talent and half, and there\u2019s nothing I can do about that.\u201d He brought out a four-inch taper. \u201cBut candles are just a ha\u2019penny\u201d", "Ha\u2019penny for a candle was a remarkably good deal. I brought out a penny \u201cI\u2019ll take two.\u201d", "\u201cThis is our last one,\u201d Ambrose said quickly. He looked around nervously before pushing it into my hand. \u201cTell you what. You can have it for free.\u201d He smiled. \u201cJust don\u2019t tell anyone. It\u2019ll be our little secret.\u201d", "I took the candle, more than a little surprised. Apparently I\u2019d frightened him with my idle threat earlier. Either that or this rude, pompous noble\u2019s son wasn\u2019t half the bastard I\u2019d taken him for.", "", "Ambrose hurried me into the stacks as quickly as possible, leaving me no time to light my candle. When the doors swung shut behind me it was as black as the inside of a sack, with only a faint hint of reddish sympathy light coming around the edges of the door behind me.", "As I didn\u2019t have any matches with me, I had to resort to sympathy. Ordinarily I could have done it quick as blinking, but my nahlrout-weary mind could barely muster the necessary concentration. I gritted my teeth, fixed the Alar in my mind, and after a few seconds I felt the cold leech into my muscles as I drew enough heat from my own body to bring the wick of the candle sputtering to life.", "Books.", "With no windows to let in the sunlight, the stacks were utterly dark except for the gentle light of my candle. Stretching away into the darkness were shelf on shelf of books. More books than I could look at if I took a whole day. More books than I could read in a lifetime.", "The air was cool and dry. It smelled of old leather, parchment, and forgotten secrets. I wondered idly how they kept the air so fresh in a building with no windows.", "Cupping a hand in front of my candle, I made my flickering way through the shelves, savoring the moment, soaking everything in. Shadows danced wildly back and forth across the ceiling as my candle\u2019s flame moved from side to side.", "The nahlrout had worn off completely by this point. My back was throbbing and my thoughts were leaden, as if I had a high fever or had taken a hard blow to the back of the head. I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be up for a long bout of reading, but I still couldn\u2019t bring myself to leave so soon. Not after everything I\u2019d gone through to get here.", "I wandered aimlessly for perhaps a quarter hour, exploring. I discovered several small stone rooms with heavy wooden doors and tables inside. They were obviously meant as a place where small groups could meet and talk without disturbing the perfect quiet of the Archives.", "I found stairwells leading down as well as up. The Archives was six stories tall, but I hadn\u2019t known it extended underground as well. How deep did it go? How many tens of thousands of books were waiting under my feet?", "I can hardly describe how comforting it was in the cool, quiet dark. I was perfectly content, lost among the endless books. It made me feel safe, knowing that the answers to all my questions were here, somewhere waiting.", "It was quite by accident that I found the four-plate door.", "It was made of a solid piece of grey stone the same color as the surrounding walls. Its frame was eight inches wide, also grey, and also one single seamless piece of stone. The door and frame fit together so tightly that a pin couldn\u2019t slide into the crack.", "It had no hinges. No handle. No window or sliding panel. Its only features were four hard copper plates. They were set flush with the face of the door, which was flush with the front of the frame, which was flush with the wall surrounding it. You could run your hand from one side of the door to the next and hardly feel the lines of it at all.", "In spite of these notable lacks, the expanse of grey stone was undoubtedly a door. It simply was. Each copper plate had a hole in its center, and though they were not shaped in the conventional way, they were undoubtedly keyholes. The door sat still as a mountain, quiet and indifferent as the sea on a windless day. This was not a door for opening. It was a door for staying closed.", "In its center, between the untarnished copper plates, a word was chiseled deep into the stone: valaritas.", "There were other locked doors in the University, places where dangerous things were kept, where old and forgotten secrets slept: silent and hidden. Doors whose opening was forbidden. Doors whose thresholds no one crossed, whose keys had been destroyed or lost, or locked away themselves for safety\u2019s sake.", "But they all paled in comparison to the four-plate door. I lay my palm on the cool, smooth face of the door and pushed, hoping against hope that it might swing open to my touch. But it was solid and unmoving as a grey-stone. I tried to peer through the holes in the copper plates but couldn\u2019t see anything by the light of my single candle.", "I wanted to get inside so badly I could taste it. It probably shows a perverse element of my personality that even though I was finally inside the Archives, surrounded by endless secrets, that I was drawn to the one locked door I had found. Perhaps it is human nature to seek out hidden things. Perhaps it is simply my nature.", "Just then I saw the red, unwavering light of a sympathy lamp approaching through the shelves. It was the first sign I\u2019d seen of any other students in the archives. I took a step back and waited, thinking to ask whoever was coming what was behind the door. What Valaritas meant.", "The red light swelled and I saw two scrivs turn a corner. They paused, then one of them bolted to where I stood and snatched my candle away, spilling hot wax on my hand in the process of extinguishing it. His expression couldn\u2019t have been more horrified if he had found me carrying a freshly severed head.", "\u201cWhat are you doing with an open flame in here?\u201d he demanded in the loudest whisper I had ever heard. He lowered his voice and waved the now extinguished candle at me. \u201cCharred body of God, what\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d", "I rubbed at the hot wax on the back of my hand. Trying to think clearly through the fog of pain and exhaustion. Of course, I thought, remembering Ambrose\u2019s smile as he pressed the candle into my hands and hurried me though the door. \u201cOur little secret.\u201d Of course. I should have known.", "", "One of the scrivs led me out of the Stacks while the other ran to fetch Master Lorren. When we emerged into the entryway, Ambrose managed to look confused and shocked.

He sent Fela away, then let me in.\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d Ambrose gaped at me, momentarily speechless. For all that I didn\u2019t like him, I must give him credit for a masterful performance. \u201cWhy in God\u2019s name would I do that?\u201d", "\u201cBecause I embarrassed you in front of Fela,\u201d I said. \u201cHe sold me the candle, too.\u201d I shook my head trying to clear my head. \u201cNo, he gave it to me.\u201d", "Ambrose\u2019s expression was amazed. \u201cLook at him.\u201d He laughed. \u201cThe little cocker is drunk or something.\u201d", "\u201cI was just whipped!\u201d I protested. My voice sounded shrill in my own ears.", "\u201cEnough!\u201d Lorren shouted, looming over us like a pillar of anger. The scrivs went pale at the sound of him.", "Lorren turned away from me, and made a brief, contemptuous gesture toward the desk. \u201cRe\u2019lar Ambrose is officially remanded for laxity in his duty.\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d Ambrose\u2019s indignant tone wasn\u2019t feigned this time.", "Lorren frowned at him, and Ambrose closed his mouth.

His expression, always so calm before, was filled with such a cold, terrible anger that I took a step away from him without meaning to. \u201cYou mean?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI care nothing for your intentions, E\u2019lir Kvothe, deceived or otherwise. All that matters is the reality of your actions. Your hand held the fire. Yours is the blame. That is the lesson all adults must learn.\u201d", "I looked down at my feet, tried desperately to think of something I could say. Some proof I could offer. My leaden thoughts were still plodding along when Lorren strode out of the room.", "\u201cI don\u2019t see why I should be punished for his stupidity,\u201d Ambrose groused to the other scrivs as I made my way numbly to the door.

You\u2019d think a member of the Arcanum would have more sense.\u201d", "I made my way to the Mess, the wheels of my thoughts turning slowly as I plodded along.

Not one drop.\u201d", "It was the nahlrout, of course. It had kept me from bleeding. It had seemed like such a good idea at the time. Now it seemed petty and foolish.

I\u2019m sure I could have found some way to explain things to Lorren if I\u2019d had my wits about me.", "As I made my way to the far corner of the room, I realized the truth. I had traded away my access to the Archives in exchange for a little notoriety.", "Still, there was nothing to do but make the best of it. If a bit of reputation was all I had to show for this debacle, I\u2019d have to do my best to build on it.

Somebody cull you for a copper?\u201d", "I shook my head. I wasn\u2019t going to announce that Ambrose had tricked me out of a whole talent. \u201cGuess who just got banned from the Archives?\u201d I said gravely as I tore the crust off my bread and dropped it into my beans.", "They looked at me blankly. After a moment Simmon took the obvious guess. \u201cUmmm ... you?\u201d", "I nodded and began to spoon up my beans. I wasn\u2019t really hungry, but I hoped a little food in my stomach might help shake off the sluggishness of the nahlrout. Besides, it went against my nature to pass up an opportunity for a meal.", "\u201cYou got suspended on your first day?\u201d Simmon said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to make studying your Chandrian folklore a whole lot harder.\u201d", "I sighed. \u201cYou could say that.\u201d", "\u201cHow long did he suspend you for?\u201d", "\u201cHe said banned\u201d I answered. \u201cHe didn\u2019t mention a time limit.\u201d", "\u201cBanned?\u201d Manet looked up at me. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t banned anyone in a dozen years.

More softly, he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. Ambrose is heir to a barony off in Vintas.\u201d He hesitated, looking to Manet. \u201cLord, how do I even start?\u201d", "Manet leaned forward and spoke in more confidential tones as well. \u201cHe\u2019s not one of those nobility who dabble here for a term or two then leave. He\u2019s been for years, climbed his way up to Re\u2019lar. He\u2019s not some seventh son either. He\u2019s the firstborn heir.

When the fellow couldn\u2019t pay, they clapped him into debtor\u2019s prison.\u201d Manet tore a piece of bread in half and daubed butter onto it. \u201cBy the time his family got him out he had lung consumption.

There was also a full forge and smelt-works that would figure prominently in any metallurgist\u2019s daydreams.", "Kilvin\u2019s workshop was located in the Artificery or, as it was more commonly called, the Fishery. It was big as the inside of a granary, holding at least two dozen thick-timbered worktables strewn with countless, nameless tools and projects in progress. The workshop was the heart of the Fishery, and Kilvin was the heart of the workshop.", "When I arrived, Kilvin was in the process of bending a twisted length of iron rod into what I could only assume was a more desirable shape. Seeing me peering in, he left it firmly clamped to the table and walked to meet me, wiping his hands on his shirt.", "He looked me over critically \u201cAre you well, E\u2019lir Kvothe?\u201d", "I\u2019d gone wandering earlier and found some willow bark to chew My back still burned and itched, but it was bearable. \u201cWell enough, Master Kilvin.\u201d", "He nodded. \u201cGood.

They were of varying sizes, though none were much larger than a man\u2019s head.", "And they were burning.", "Seeing my expression, Kilvin made a gesture. \u201cCome,\u201d he said, and led me to a narrow stairway made of wrought iron. Reaching the top, we stepped out onto a series of slim iron walkways twenty-five feet above the ground, weaving their way among the thick timbers that supported the roof. After a moment of maneuvering through the maze of timber and iron, we came to the hanging row of glass spheres with fires burning inside them.", "\u201cThese,\u201d Kilvin gestured, \u201care my lamps.\u201d", "It was only then that I realized what they were. Some were filled with liquid and wicking, much like ordinary lamps, but most of them were utterly unfamiliar. One contained nothing but a boiling grey smoke that flickered sporadically. Another sphere contained a wick hanging in empty air from a silver wire, burning with a motionless white flame despite its apparent lack of fuel.", "Two hanging side by side were twins save that one had a blue flame and the other was a hot-forge-orange. Some were small as plums, others large as melons. One held what looked like a piece of black coal and a piece of white chalk, and where the two pieces were pressed together, an angry red flame burned outward in all directions.", "Kilvin let me look for a long while before he moved closer. \u201cAmong the Cealdar there are legends of ever-burning lamps. I believe that such a thing was once within the scope of our craft. Ten years I have been looking. I have made many lamps, some of them very good, very long burning.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cBut none of them ever-burning.\u201d", "He walked down the line to point at one of the hanging spheres. \u201cDo you know this one, E\u2019lir Kvothe?\u201d It held nothing but a knob of greenish-greyish wax that was burning with a greenish-greyish tongue of flame. I shook my head.", "\u201cHmmm. You should. White lithium salt. I thought of it three span before you came to us. It is good so far, twenty-four days and I expect many more.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cYour guessing this thing surprised me, as it took me ten years to think of it. Your second guess, sodium oil, was not as good. I tried it years ago. Eleven days.\u201d", "He moved all the way to the end of the row, pointing at the empty sphere with the motionless white flame. \u201cSeventy days,\u201d he said proudly. \u201cI do not hope that this will be the one, for hoping is a foolish game. But if it burns six more days it will be my best lamp in these ten years.\u201d", "He watched it for a while, his expression oddly soft. \u201cBut I do not hope,\u201d he said resolutely. \u201cI make new lamps and take my measurements. That is the only way to make progress.\u201d", "Wordlessly he led me back down to the floor of the workshop. Once there, he turned to me. \u201cHands,\u201d he said in a peremptory way.

He turned them over, looking at them carefully. \u201cYou have Cealdar hands,\u201d he said in a grudging compliment. He held his own up for me to see. They were thick-fingered, with wide palms. He made two fists that looked more like mauls than balled hands. \u201cI had many years before these hands could learn to be Cealdar hands. You are lucky. You will work here.\u201d Only by the quizzical tilting of his head did he make the gruff grumble of a statement into an invitation.", "\u201cOh, yes. I mean, thank you, sir.

It\u2019s not.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d I snapped. \u201cIt\u2019s a playground and all the other children are jealous because I got to play \u2018get whipped bloody and banned from the Archives\u2019 and they didn\u2019t.\u201d", "Elodin stopped walking and turned to look at me. \u201cFine. Prove me wrong. Prove that you\u2019ve thought this through. Why does a University with under fifteen hundred students need an asylum the size of the royal palace?\u201d", "My mind raced. \u201cMost students are from well-to-do families,\u201d I said. \u201cThey\u2019ve led easy lives. When forced to ...\u201d", "\u201cWrong,\u201d Elodin said dismissively turning to walk down the hall. \u201cIt is because of what we study Because of the way we train our minds to move.\u201d", "\u201cSo ciphering and grammar make people crazy,\u201d I said, taking care to phrase it as a statement.", "Elodin stopped walking and wrenched open the nearest door. Panicked screaming burst out into the hallway. \u201c... IN ME! THEY\u2019RE IN ME! THEY\u2019RE IN ME! THEY\u2019RE IN ME!\u201d Through the open door I could see a young man thrashing against the leather restraints that bound him to the bed at wrist, waist, neck, and ankle.", "\u201cTrigonometry and diagrammed logic don\u2019t do this,\u201d Elodin said, looking me in the eye.", "\u201cTHEY\u2019RE IN ME!

THEY\u2019RE IN ME! THEY\u2019RE\u2014\u201d", "Elodin closed the door. Though I could still hear the screaming faintly through the thick door, the near-silence was stunning. \u201cDo you know why they call this place the Rookery?\u201d Elodin asked.", "I shook my head.", "\u201cBecause it\u2019s where you go if you\u2019re a-ravin\u2019.\u201d He smiled a wild smile. He laughed a terrible laugh.", "", "Elodin led me through a long series of hallways to a different wing of the Crockery. Finally we turned a corner and I saw something new: a door made entirely of copper.", "Elodin took a key from his pocket and unlocked it. \u201cI like to stop in when I\u2019m back in the neighborhood,\u201d he said casually as he opened the door. \u201cCheck my mail. Water the plants and such.\u201d", "He pulled off one of his socks, tied a knot in it, and used it to wedge the door open. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice place to visit, but, you know ...\u201d He tugged on the door, making sure it wouldn\u2019t swing closed. \u201cNot again.\u201d", "The first thing I noticed about the room was something strange about the air. At first I thought it might be soundproofed like Alder Whin\u2019s, but looking around I saw the walls and ceilings were bare grey stone. Next I thought the air might be stale, except when I drew a breath I smelled lavender and fresh linen. It was almost like there was a pressure on my ears, as if I were deep underwater, except of course that I wasn\u2019t. I waved a hand in front of me, almost expecting the air to feel different, thicker. It didn\u2019t.", "\u201cPretty irritating, huh?\u201d I turned around to see Elodin watching me. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you noticed, actually. Not many do.\u201d", "The room was a definite step above Alder Whin\u2019s. It had a four-post bed with curtains, an overstuffed couch, an empty bookcase, and a large table with several chairs. Most notable were the huge windows looking out over the lawns and gardens. I could see a balcony outside, but there didn\u2019t seem to be any way to get to it.", "\u201cWatch this,\u201d Elodin said. He picked up one of the high-backed wooden chairs, lifted it with both hands, spun in a circle, and flung it hard at the window. I cringed, but instead of a terrible crash, there was just a dull splintering of wood. The chair fell to the floor in a ruined tangle of timber and upholstery.", "\u201cI used to do that for hours,\u201d Elodin said, drawing a deep breath and looking around the room fondly. \u201cGood times.\u201d", "I went to look at the windows. They were thicker than usual, but not that thick. They seemed normal except for faint reddish streaks running through them. I glanced at the window frame. It was copper too. I looked slowly around at the room, eyeing its bare stone walls, feeling its strangely heavy air. I noticed the door didn\u2019t even have a handle on the inside, let alone a lock. Why would anyone go through all the trouble of making a solid copper door?", "I decided on my second question. \u201cHow did you get out?\u201d", "\u201cFinally,\u201d Elodin said with a tinge of exasperation.", "He slouched onto the couch. \u201cYou see, once upon a time Elodin the Great found himself locked in a high tower.\u201d He gestured to the room around us. \u201cHe had been stripped of his tools: his coin, key, and candle. Furthermore, his cell had no door worth mentioning. No window that could be breached.\u201d He made dismissive gestures at each of these. \u201cEven the name of the wind was hidden from him by the clever machinations of his captors.\u201d", "Elodin got up from the couch and began to pace the room. \u201cAll around him was nothing but smooth hard stone. It was a cell no man had ever escaped.\u201d", "He stopped pacing and held up a finger dramatically. \u201cBut Elodin the Great knew the names of all things, and so all things were his to command.\u201d He faced the grey wall beside the windows. \u201cHe said to the stone: \u2018BREAK\u2019 and the ...\u201d", "Elodin trailed off, his head tilting to one side curiously His eyes narrowed. \u201cSod me, they changed it,\u201d he said quietly to himself. \u201cHuh.\u201d He stepped closer to the wall and lay a hand on it.", "I let my attention wander. Wil and Sim had been right, the man was cracked in the head. What would happen if I ran out of the room, unstuck the door, and slammed it? Would the other masters thank me?", "\u201cOh,\u201d Elodin said suddenly, laughing. \u201cThat was half-clever of them.\u201d He took two steps back from the wall. \u201cCYAERBAS ALIEN.\u201d", "I saw the wall move. It rippled like a hanging rug thumped with a stick. Then it simply ... fell. Like dark water poured from a bucket, tons of fine grey sand spilled across the floor in a sudden rush, burying Elodin\u2019s feet up to his shins.", "Sunlight and birdsong poured into the room. Where there had been a foot of solid grey stone before, there was now a gaping hole big enough to drive a cart through.", "But the hole wasn\u2019t completely clear, some green material was spread across the opening. It almost looked like a dirty, tangled net, but it was too irregular for netting. It was more like a thick, tattered cobweb.", "\u201cThat wasn\u2019t there before,\u201d Elodin said apologetically as he pulled his feet free of the grey sand. \u201cIt was much more dramatic the first time, let me assure you.\u201d", "I simply stood, stunned by what I\u2019d just seen. This wasn\u2019t sympathy. This wasn\u2019t anything I\u2019d ever seen before. All I could think of was the old line from a hundred half-remembered stories: And Taborlin the Great said to the stone: \u201cBREAK!\u201d and the stone broke....", "Elodin wrenched off one of the chair\u2019s legs and used it to batter at the tangled green web that stretched across the opening. Parts of it broke easily or flaked away. Where it was thicker he used the leg as a lever to bend pieces aside. Where it bent or broke it glimmered bright in the sunlight. More copper, I thought. Veins of copper running through the blocks of stone that made the wall.", "Elodin dropped the chair leg and ducked through the gap. Through the window I saw him lean against the white stone railing on the balcony.", "I followed him outside. As soon as I stepped onto the balcony, the air no longer felt strangely heavy and still.", "\u201cTwo years,\u201d he said, looking out over the gardens. \u201cAble to see this balcony but not stand on it. Able to see the wind, but not hear it, not feel it on my face.\u201d He swung one leg up over the stone railing so he was sitting on it, then dropped a few feet to land on the flat piece of roof just underneath. He wandered out across the roof, away from the building.", "I hopped the rail myself and followed him to the edge of the roof. We were only about twenty feet up, but the gardens and fountains spreading out on all sides made for a spectacular view. Elodin stood perilously near the edge, his master\u2019s robe flapping around him like a dark flag. He looked rather impressive, actually, if you were willing to ignore the fact that he was still only wearing one sock.", "I went to stand beside him on the edge of the roof. I knew what my third question had to be. \u201cWhat do I have to do,\u201d I asked, \u201cto study naming under you?\u201d", "He met my eye calmly, appraising me. \u201cJump,\u201d he said. \u201cJump off this roof.\u201d", "That\u2019s when I realized that all of this had been a test. Elodin had been taking my measure ever since we met. He had a grudging respect for my tenacity, and he had been surprised that I noticed something odd about the air in his room. He was on the verge of accepting me as a student.", "But he needed more, proof of my dedication. A demonstration. A leap of faith.", "And as I stood there, a piece of story came to mind. So Taborlin fell, but he did not despair. For he knew the name of the wind, and so the wind obeyed him. It cradled and caressed him. It bore him to the ground as gently as a puff of thistledown. It set him on his feet softly as a mother\u2019s kiss.", "Elodin knew the name of the wind.", "Still looking him in the eye, I stepped off the edge of the roof.", "Elodin\u2019s expression was marvelous. I have never seen a man so astonished. I spun slightly as I fell, so he stayed in my line of vision. I saw him raise one hand slightly, as if making a belated attempt to grab hold of me.", "I felt weightless, like I was floating.", "Then I struck the ground. Not gently, like a feather settling down. Hard. Like a brick hitting a cobblestone street. I landed on my back with my left arm beneath me. My vision went dark as the back of my head struck the ground and all the air was driven from my body.", "I didn\u2019t lose consciousness. I just lay there, breathless and unable to move. I remember thinking, quite earnestly, that I was dead. That I was blind.", "Eventually my sight returned, leaving me blinking against the sudden brightness of the blue sky. Pain tore through my shoulder and I tasted blood. I couldn\u2019t breathe. I tried to roll off my arm, but my body wouldn\u2019t listen to me. I had broken my neck ... my back ...", "After a long, terrifying moment, I managed to gasp a shallow breath, then another. I gave a sigh of relief and realized that I had at least one broken rib in addition to everything else, but I moved my fingers slightly, then my toes. They worked. I hadn\u2019t broken my spine.", "As I lay there, counting my blessings and broken ribs, Elodin stepped into my field of vision.", "He looked down at me. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d His expression was a mix of awe and disbelief. \u201cEver.\u201d", "", "And that is when I decided to pursue the noble art of artificing. Not that I had a lot of other options. Before helping me limp to the Medica, Elodin made it clear that anyone stupid enough to jump off a roof was too reckless to be allowed to hold a spoon in his presence, let alone study something as \u201cprofound and volatile\u201d as naming.", "Nevertheless, I wasn\u2019t terribly put out by Elodin\u2019s refusal. Storybook magic or no, I was not eager to study under a man whose first set of lessons had left me with three broken ribs, a mild concussion, and a dislocated shoulder.", "", "", ""], "CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN": ["CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN", "Barbs", "\nAside from its rocky start, my first term went fairly smoothly I studied in the Medica, learning more about the body and how to heal it. I practiced my Siaru with Wilem and helped him with his Aturan in exchange.", "I joined the ranks of the Artificery, studying how to blow glass, mix alloys, draw wire, inscribe metal, and sculpt stone.", "Most evenings I came back to Kilvin\u2019s workshop to work. I chipped casings off bronze castings, washed glassware, and ground ore for alloys. It was not demanding work, but every span Kilvin gave me a copper jot, sometimes two. I suspected there was a great tally board in that methodical mind of his, carefully marking down the hours each person worked.", "I learned things of a less academic nature as well. Some of my Arcanum bunkmates taught me a card game called dogsbreath. I returned the favor by giving an impromptu lesson in psychology, probability, and manual dexterity. I won almost two whole talents before they stopped inviting me back to their games.", "I became tight friends with Wilem and Simmon. I had some few others, but not many, and none so close as Wil and Sim. My swift rise to E\u2019lir alienated me from most of the other students. Whether they resented or admired me, most students held themselves apart.", "And there was Ambrose. To deem us simply enemies is to lose the true flavor of our relationship. It was more like the two of us entered into a business partnership in order to more efficiently pursue our mutual interest of hating each other.", "However, even with my vendetta against Ambrose, I still had a great deal of time on my hands. Since I wasn\u2019t able to spend it in the Archives, I spent some time nurturing my budding reputation.", "You see, my dramatic entrance to the University had made quite a stir. I\u2019d made my way into the Arcanum in three days instead of the usual three terms. I was the youngest member by almost two years. I had openly defied one of the masters in front of his own class and avoided expulsion. When whipped, I hadn\u2019t cried out or bled.", "On top of everything else, I had apparently managed to infuriate Master Elodin to such an extent that he had thrown me off the roof of the Crockery. I let that story circulate uncorrected, as it was preferable to the embarrassing truth.", "All together, it was enough to start a steady stream of rumor around me, and I decided to take advantage of it. Reputation is like a sort of armor, or a weapon you can brandish if need be. I decided that if I was going to be an arcanist, I might as well be a well-known arcanist.", "So I let slip a few pieces of information: I had been admitted without a letter of recommendation. The masters had given me three talents to attend, rather than make me pay a tuition. I had survived for years on the streets of Tarbean, living off my wits.", "I even started a few rumors that were pure nonsense, lies so outrageous that people would repeat them despite the fact that they were obviously untrue. I had demon blood in me. I could see in the dark. I only slept an hour each night. When the moon was full I would talk in my sleep, speaking a strange language no one could understand.", "Basil, my former bunkmate from Mews, helped me start these rumors. I would make up the stories, he would tell a few people, then together we would watch them spread like a fire in a field. It was an amusing hobby.", "But my ongoing feud with Ambrose added to my reputation more than anything else. Everyone was stunned that I dared openly defy a powerful noble\u2019s firstborn son.", "We had several dramatic encounters that first term. I won\u2019t bore you with the details. We\u2019d cross paths and he would make some offhand comment loud enough for everyone in the room to hear. Or he would sneer at me under the guise of a compliment. \u201cYou must tell me who cuts your hair ...\u201d", "Anyone with a lick of common sense knew how to deal with arrogant nobility. The tailor I had terrorized back in Tarbean knew what to do. You take your lumps, duck your head, and get the whole thing over as quickly as possible.", "But I always fought back, and while Ambrose was intelligent and reasonably well-spoken, he was no match for my trouper\u2019s tongue. I had been raised on the stage, and my sharp Ruh wits ensured that I got the better of our exchanges.", "Still Ambrose continued to seek me out, like a dog too stupid to avoid a porcupine. He would snap at me and leave with a face full of barbs. And each time we parted ways we hated each other just a little more.", "People noticed, and by the end of the term I had a reputation for reckless bravery. But the truth is, I was merely fearless.", "There\u2019s a difference, you see. In Tarbean I\u2019d learned real fear. I feared hunger, pneumonia, guards with hobnail boots, older boys with bottleglass knives. Confronting Ambrose required no real bravery on my part. I simply couldn\u2019t muster any fear of him. I saw him as a puffed-up clown. I thought he was harmless.", "I was a fool.", "", "", ""], "CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT": ["CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT", "Interlude\u2014A Silence of a Different Kind", "\nBast sat in the Waystone Inn and tried to keep his hands motionless in his lap.

Bast took another breath\u2014sixteen\u2014and braced himself against the moment he feared would come.", "It would not be to Bast\u2019s credit to say that he was afraid of nothing, as only fools and priests are never afraid. But it is true that very few things unnerved him. Heights, for instance, he didn\u2019t care for very much. And the great summer storms that came through these parts that blackened the sky and tore up deep-rooted oaks made him feel uncomfortably small and helpless.", "But when you came down to it, nothing really frightened him, not storms, not tall ladders, not even the scrael. Bast was brave by being largely fearless. Nothing would turn him pale, or if it did, he didn\u2019t stay pale for very long.", "Oh, certainly he didn\u2019t relish the thought of someone hurting him. Stabbing him with bitter iron, searing him with hot coals, that sort of thing. But just because he didn\u2019t like the thought of his blood on the outside didn\u2019t mean he was really afraid of those things. He just didn\u2019t want them to happen. To really fear something you have to dwell on it. And since there was nothing that preyed on Bast\u2019s waking mind in this fashion, there was nothing his heart truly feared.", "But hearts can change. Ten years ago he had lost his grip climbing a tall rennel tree to pick fruit for a girl he fancied. After he slipped, he had hung for a long minute, head down, before falling. In that long minute, a small fear rooted inside him, and had stayed with him ever since.", "In the same way, Bast had learned a new fear of late. A year ago he had been fearless as any sane man can hope to be, but now Bast feared silence. Not the ordinary silence that came from a simple absence of things moving about and making noise. Bast feared the deep, weary silence that gathered around his master at times, like an invisible shroud.", "Bast breathed in again\u2014seventeen. He fought not to wring his hands as he waited for the deep silence to invade the room. He waited for it to crystallize and show its teeth on the edges of the cool quiet that had pooled in the Waystone. He knew how it came, like the frost that bleeds out of the winter ground, hardening the clear water that an early thaw leaves in wagon ruts.", "But before Bast could draw another breath, Kvothe straightened in his chair and made a motion for Chronicler to lay down his pen. Bast nearly wept as he sensed the silence scatter like a dark bird startled into flight.", "Kvothe gave a sigh that hovered between annoyance and resignation. \u201cI will admit,\u201d he said. \u201cThat I am not sure how to approach the next part of the story.\u201d", "Afraid to let the silence stretch for too long, Bast chirruped, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you simply talk about what is most important first? Then you can go back and touch on other things, if you need to.\u201d", "\u201cAs if it were as simple as that,\u201d Kvothe said sharply. \u201cWhat is most important? My magic or my music? My triumphs or my follies?\u201d", "Bast flushed a deep crimson and bit his lips.", "Kvothe let out his breath in a sudden rush. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Bast. It\u2019s good advice, as all of your seemingly inane advice turns out to be.\u201d He pushed his chair back from the table. \u201cBut before we continue, the real world has certain calls on me that I can no longer ignore. If you will please excuse me for a moment?\u201d", "Chronicler and Bast stood as well, stretching their legs and attending to calls of their own. Bast lit the lamps. Kvothe produced more cheese and bread and hard spiced sausage. They ate, and some small effort was made at polite conversation, but their minds were elsewhere, dwelling on the story.", "Bast ate half of everything. Chronicler accounted for a sizable, though more modest amount. Kvothe had a bite or two before he spoke. \u201cOnward then. Music and magic. Triumph and folly. Think now. What does our story need? What vital element is it lacking?\u201d", "\u201cWomen, Reshi,\u201d Bast said immediately. \u201cThere\u2019s a real paucity of women.\u201d", "Kvothe smiled. \u201cNot women, Bast. A woman.

Though I fear I may not be equal to the challenge.\u201d", "Chronicler picked up his pen, but before he could dip it, Kvothe held up a hand. \u201cLet me say one thing before I start. I\u2019ve told stories in the past, painted pictures with words, told hard lies and harder truths. Once, I sang colors to a blind man. Seven hours I played, but at the end he said he saw them, green and red and gold. That, I think, was easier than this. Trying to make you understand her with nothing more than words.

Because of this, slots later in the span were highly prized, as they gave students more time to study and prepare. There was a vigorous trade in appointment times after the lottery was held.

If I\u2019d wanted to, I could have sold my slot, but I preferred to take the extra time to study I knew my performance would have to be brilliant, as several of the masters were now less than impressed by me.

I now knew it was grounds for expulsion, and I couldn\u2019t risk that.", "Despite the long days I spent studying with Wil and Sim, admissions were difficult. I breezed through many of the questions, but Hemme was openly hostile, asking questions with more than one answer so that nothing I said could be correct. Brandeur was difficult as well, clearly helping Hemme carry his grudge. Lorren was unreadable, but I sensed his disapproval rather than seeing it on his face.", "Afterward, I fidgeted while the masters discussed my tuition. Voices were calm and muted at first, then became somewhat louder. Eventually, Kilvin stood and shook a finger at Hemme while shouting and pounding the table with his other hand.

Listening to the average citizen speak, it was easy to forget that this part of the world had not seen an arcanist burned for nearly three hundred years.", "To be fair, it should be mentioned that the University had a vague contempt for Imre\u2019s populace, too, viewing them as self-indulgent and decadent. The arts that were viewed so highly in Imre were seen as frivolous by those at the University. Often, students who quit the University were said to have \u201cgone over the river,\u201d the implication being that minds that were too weak for academia had to settle for tinkering with the arts.", "And both sides of the river were, ultimately, hypocrites. University students complained about frivolous musicians and flufmead actors, then lined up to pay for performances. Imre\u2019s population griped about unnatural arts being practiced two miles away, but when an aqueduct collapsed or someone fell suddenly sick, they were quick to call on engineers and doctors trained at the University.", "All in all, it was a long-standing and uneasy truce where both sides complained while maintaining a grudging tolerance. Those people did have their uses after all, you just wouldn\u2019t want your daughter marrying one....", "Since Imre was such a haven for music and drama, you might think I spent a great deal of time there, but nothing could be further from the truth. I had been there only once. Wilem and Simmon had taken me to an inn where a trio of skilled musicians played: lute, flute, and drum. I bought a short beer for ha\u2019penny and relaxed, fully intending to enjoy an evening with my friends....", "But I couldn\u2019t. Bare minutes after the music started I practically fled the room. I doubt very much you\u2019ll be able to understand why, but I suppose I have to explain if things are to make any sense at all.", "I couldn\u2019t stand being near music and not be a part of it. It was like watching the woman you love bedding down with another man. No. Not really. It was like....", "It was like the sweet-eaters I\u2019d seen in Tarbean. Denner resin was highly illegal, of course, but that didn\u2019t matter in most parts of the city. The resin was sold wrapped in waxy paper, like a sucking candy or a toffee. Chewing it filled you with euphoria. Bliss. Contentment.", "But after a few hours you were shaking, filled with a desperate hunger for more, and that hunger grew worse the longer you used it. Once in Tarbean I saw a young girl of no more than sixteen with the telltale hollow eyes and unnaturally white teeth of the hopelessly addicted. She was begging a sailor for a sweet, which he held tauntingly out of reach. He told her it was hers if she stripped naked and danced for him, right there in the street.", "She did, not caring who might be watching, not caring that it was nearly Midwinter and she stood in four inches of snow. She pulled off her clothes and danced desperately, her thin limbs pale and shaking, her movements pathetic and jerky. Then, when the sailor laughed and shook his head, she fell to her knees in the snow, begging and weeping, clutching frantically at his legs, promising him anything, anything....", "That is how I felt, watching the musicians play. I couldn\u2019t stand it. The everyday lack of my music was like a toothache I had grown used to. I could live with it. But having what I wanted dangled in front of me was more than I could bear.", "So I avoided Imre until the problem of my second term\u2019s tuition forced me back across the river. I had learned that Devi was the person anyone could ask for a loan, no matter how desperate the circumstances.", "", "So I crossed the Omethi by Stonebridge and made my way to Imre. Devi\u2019s place of business was through an alley and up a narrow balcony staircase behind a butcher\u2019s shop. This part of Imre reminded me of Waterside in Tar-bean. The cloying smell of rancid fat from the butcher shop below made me thankful for the cool autumn breeze.", "I hesitated in front of the heavy door, looking down into the alley. I was about to become involved in dangerous business. A Cealdish moneylender could take you to court if you didn\u2019t repay your loan. A gaelet would simply have you beaten, or robbed, or both. This was not smart. I was playing with fire.", "But I didn\u2019t have any better options. I took a deep breath, squared my shoulders, and knocked on the door.", "I wiped my sweaty palms against my cloak, hoping to keep them reasonably dry for when I shook Devi\u2019s hand. I had learned in Tarbean that the best way to deal with this type of man was to act with confidence and self-assurance. They were in the business of taking advantage of other people\u2019s weakness.", "I heard the sound of a heavy bolt being drawn back, then the door opened, revealing a young girl with straight, strawberry-blond hair framing a pixielike face. She smiled at me, cute as a new button. \u201cYes?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m looking for Devi,\u201d I said.", "\u201cYou\u2019ve found her,\u201d she said easily. \u201cCome on in.\u201d", "I stepped inside and she closed the door behind her, sliding the iron bolt home. The room was windowless, but well-lit and filled with the scent of lavender, a welcome change from the smell of the alley. There were hangings on the walls, but the only real furniture was a small desk, a bookshelf, and a large canopy bed with the curtains drawn around it.", "\u201cPlease,\u201d she said, gesturing to the desk. \u201cHave a seat.\u201d", "She settled herself behind the desk, folding her hands across the top. The way she carried herself made me rethink her age. I\u2019d misjudged her because of her small size, but even so, she couldn\u2019t be much older than her early twenties, hardly what I had expected to find.", "Devi blinked prettily at me.", "\u201cI need a loan,\u201d I said.", "\u201cHow about your name, first?\u201d She smiled. \u201cYou already know mine.\u201d", "\u201cKvothe.\u201d", "\u201cReally?\u201d She arched an eyebrow. \u201cI\u2019ve heard a thing or two about you.\u201d She looked me up and down. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be taller.\u201d", "I could say the same. I was caught off balance by the situation. I\u2019d been ready for a muscular thug and negotiations filled with thinly veiled threats and bravado. I didn\u2019t know what to make of this smiling waif. \u201cWhat have you heard?\u201d I asked to fill the silence. \u201cNothing bad, I hope.\u201d", "\u201cGood and bad.\u201d She grinned. \u201cBut nothing boring.\u201d", "I folded my hands to keep from fidgeting. \u201cSo how exactly do we do this?\u201d", "\u201cNot much for banter, are you?\u201d she said, giving a brief, disappointed sigh. \u201cFair enough, straight to business. How much do you need?\u201d", "\u201cOnly about a talent,\u201d I said. \u201cEight jots, actually\u201d", "She shook her head seriously, her strawberry-blond hair swinging back and forth. \u201cI can\u2019t do that, I\u2019m afraid. It\u2019s not worth my while to make ha\u2019penny loans.\u201d", "I frowned. \u201cHow much is worth your while?\u201d", "\u201cFour talents,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the minimum.\u201d", "\u201cAnd the interest?\u201d", "\u201cFifty percent every two months. So if you\u2019re looking to borrow as little as possible, it\u2019ll be two talents at the end of the term. You can pay off the whole debt for six if you like. But until I get all the principle back, it\u2019s two talents every term.\u201d", "I nodded, not terribly surprised. It was roughly four times what even the most avaricious moneylender would charge. \u201cBut I\u2019m paying interest on money I don\u2019t really need.\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d she said, meeting my eyes seriously. \u201cYou\u2019re paying interest on money you borrowed. That\u2019s the deal.\u201d", "\u201cHow about two talents?\u201d I said. \u201cThen at the end\u2014\u201d", "Devi waved her hands, cutting me off. \u201cWe aren\u2019t bargaining here. I\u2019m just informing you as to the conditions of the loan.\u201d She smiled apologetically. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t make that clear from the beginning.\u201d", "I looked at her, the set of her shoulders, the way she met my eyes. \u201cOkay,\u201d I said, resigned. \u201cWhere do I sign?\u201d", "She gave me a slightly puzzled look, her forehead furrowing slightly \u201cNo need to sign anything.\u201d She opened a drawer and pulled out a small brown bottle with a glass stopper. She laid a long pin next to it on the desk. \u201cJust a little blood.\u201d", "I sat frozen in my chair, my arms at my sides. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she reassured me. \u201cThe pin\u2019s clean. I only need about three good drops.\u201d", "I finally found my voice. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d", "Devi cocked her head to one side, a tiny smile curling one edge of her mouth. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d she said, surprised. \u201cIt\u2019s rare that anyone comes here without knowing the whole story.\u201d", "\u201cI can\u2019t believe anyone actually ...\u201d I stalled, at a loss for words.", "\u201cNot everyone does,\u201d she said. \u201cI usually do business with students and ex-students. Folk on this side of the river would think I was some sort of witch or a demon or some nonsense like that. Members of the Arcanum know exactly why I want blood, and what I can do with it.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re a member of the Arcanum too?\u201d", "\u201cFormer,\u201d she said, her smile fading a little. \u201cI made Re\u2019lar before I left. I know enough so that with a little blood, you can never hide from me. I can dowse you out anywhere.\u201d", "\u201cAmong other things,\u201d I said, incredulously, thinking of the wax mommet I\u2019d made of Hemme at the beginning of the term. That was just hair. Blood was much more effective at creating a link. \u201cYou could kill me.\u201d", "She gave me a frank look. \u201cYou\u2019re awfully thick to be the Arcanum\u2019s bright new star. Think it through. Would I stay in business if I made a habit of malfeasance?\u201d", "\u201cThe masters know about this?\u201d", "She laughed. \u201cGod\u2019s body, of course not. Neither does the constable, the bishop, or my mother.\u201d She pointed to her chest, then to me. \u201cI know and you know. That\u2019s usually enough to ensure a good working relationship between the two of us.\u201d", "\u201cWhat about unusually}\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t have your money at the end of the term? What then?\u201d", "She spread her hands and shrugged carelessly. \u201cThen we work something out between the two of us. Like rational people. Maybe you work for me. Tell me secrets. Do me favors.\u201d She smiled and gave me a slow, lecherous looking over, laughing at my discomfiture. \u201cIf worse comes to worst, and you end up being extraordinarily uncooperative, I could probably sell your blood to someone to recover my loss. Everyone has enemies.\u201d She shrugged easily.", "\u201cBut I\u2019ve never had things descend to that level. The threat is usually enough to keep people in line.\u201d", "She looked at the expression on my face and her shoulders slumped a little. \u201cCome on now,\u201d she said gently. \u201cYou came here expecting some thick-necked gaelet with scarred knuckles. You were ready to make a deal with someone ready to beat twelve distinct colors of hell out of you if you were a day late. My way is better. Simpler.\u201d", "\u201cThis is insane,\u201d I said, getting to my feet. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d", "Devi\u2019s cheerful expression faded. \u201cGet ahold of yourself,\u201d she said, plainly growing exasperated. \u201cYou\u2019re acting like some farmer who thinks I\u2019m trying to buy his soul. It\u2019s just a little blood so I can keep tabs on you. It\u2019s like collateral.\u201d She made a calming gesture with both hands, as if smoothing the air. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll tell you what. I\u2019ll let you borrow half the minimum.\u201d She looked at me expectantly. \u201cTwo talents. Does that make it easier?\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have wasted your time, but I can\u2019t do it. Are there any other gaelets around?\u201d", "\u201cOf course,\u201d she said coolly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t feel particularly inclined to give out that sort of information.\u201d She tilted her head quizzically. \u201cBy the way, today\u2019s Cendling, isn\u2019t it? Don\u2019t you need your tuition by noon tomorrow?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll find them on my own then,\u201d I snapped.", "\u201cI\u2019m sure you will, clever boy like you.\u201d Devi waved me away with the back of her hand. \u201cFeel free to let yourself out.

Trying to think of a way around my problem.", "I had a decent chance of paying off the two-talent loan. I hoped to move up the ranks in the Fishery soon. Once I was allowed to pursue my own projects, I could start earning real money. All I needed was to stay in classes long enough. It was just a matter of time.", "That\u2019s really what I was borrowing: time. One more term. Who knew what opportunities might present themselves in the next two months?", "But even as I tried to talk myself into it, I knew the truth. It was a bad idea. It was begging for trouble. I would swallow my pride and see if Wil or Sim or Sovoy could lend me the eight jots I needed. I sighed, resigning myself to a term of sleeping outside and scavenging meals where I could find them. At least it couldn\u2019t be worse than my time in Tarbean.", "I was just about to head back to the University when my restless pacing took me by a pawnshop\u2019s window.

To this day I do not remember actually entering the store.", "\u201cFour talents even,\u201d the owner said brightly. I guessed he was new to the job, or drunk. Pawnbrokers are never cheerful, not even in rich cities like Imre.", "\u201cAh,\u201d I said, not bothering to hide my disappointment. \u201cCould I take a look at it?\u201d", "He handed it over. It wasn\u2019t much to look at. The grain of the wood was uneven, the varnish rough and scratched. Its frets were made of gut and badly in need of replacing, but that was of little concern to me, as I typically played fretless anyway. The bowl was rosewood, so the sound of it wouldn\u2019t be terribly subtle. But on the other hand, rosewood would carry better in a crowded taproom, cutting through the murmur of idle conversation. I tapped the bowl with a finger and it gave off a resonant hum. Solid, but not pretty. I began to tune it so I would have an excuse to hold it a while longer.", "\u201cI might be able to go as low as three and five,\u201d the man behind the counter said.", "My ears pricked up as I heard something in his tone: desperation. It occurred to me that an ugly, used lute might not sell very well in a city full of nobility and prosperous musicians. I shook my head. \u201cThe strings are old.\u201d Actually they were fine, but I hoped he didn\u2019t know that.", "\u201cTrue,\u201d he said, reassuring me of his ignorance, \u201cbut strings are cheap.\u201d", "\u201cI suppose,\u201d I said doubtfully. With a deliberate plan, I set each of the strings just a hair out of tune with the others. I struck a chord and listened to the grating sound. I gave the lute\u2019s neck a sour, speculative look. \u201cI think the neck might be cracked.\u201d I strummed a minor chord that sounded even less appealing. \u201cDoes that sound cracked to you?\u201d I strummed it again, harder.", "\u201cThree and two?\u201d He asked hopefully.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not for me,\u201d I said, as if correcting him. \u201cIt\u2019s for my little brother. The little bastard won\u2019t leave mine alone.\u201d", "I strummed again and grimaced. \u201cI may not like the little sprit very much, but I\u2019m not cruel enough to buy him a lute with a sour neck.\u201d I paused significantly When nothing was forthcoming, I prompted him. \u201cNot for three and two.\u201d", "\u201cThree even?\u201d he said hopefully.", "To all appearances I held the lute casually, carelessly. But in my heart I was clutching it with a white-knuckled fierceness. I cannot hope for you to understand this. When the Chandrian killed my troupe, they destroyed every piece of family and home I had ever known. But in some ways it had been worse when my father\u2019s lute was broken in Tarbean. It had been like losing a limb, an eye, a vital organ. Without my music, I had wandered Tarbean for years, half-alive, like a crippled veteran or one of the walking dead.", "\u201cListen,\u201d I said to him frankly. \u201cI\u2019ve got two and two for you.\u201d I pulled out my purse. \u201cYou can take it, or this ugly thing can gather dust on a high shelf for the next ten years.\u201d", "I met his eye, careful to keep my face from showing how badly I needed it.

What really happens is the two runes tear the bricks apart with the strength of their attraction. To prevent this you have to add the rune am to each of the bricks. Am is the rune for clay, and it makes the two pieces of clay cling to each other, solving your problem.", "Except that am and dock don\u2019t fit together. They\u2019re the wrong shape. To get them to fit you have to add a few linking runes, gea and teh. Then, for balance, you have to add gea and teh to the other brick, too. Then the bricks cling to each other without breaking.", "But only if the bricks are made out of clay. Most bricks aren\u2019t. So, generally, it is a better idea to mix iron into the ceramic of the brick before it is fired. Of course, that means you have to use fehr instead of am.

It could only be accessed by clambering through a high window in one of the lecture halls or by climbing down a gnarled apple tree, if you happened to be on the roof.", "I came here to practice my lute. My bunk in Mews was not convenient. Not only was music viewed as frivolous on this side of the river, but I would only make more enemies by playing while my bunkmates tried to sleep or study.

A sudden rustling, like a startled animal down in the courtyard. But then there was something else, a noise unlike anything a squirrel or rabbit would make in the hedge. It was a hard noise, a vaguely metallic thud, as if someone had dropped a heavy bar of iron.", "I stopped playing, the half-finished melody still running through my head. Was another student down there, listening? I put my lute back in its case before I made my way over to the lip of the roof and looked down.", "I couldn\u2019t see through the thick hedge that covered most of the eastern edge of the courtyard. Had a student climbed through the window?", "The sunset was fading quickly, and by the time I made it down the apple tree most of the courtyard lay in shadow. I could see from here that the high window was closed; no one had come in that way. Even though it was quickly growing dark, curiosity won over caution and I made my way into the hedge.", "There was quite a lot of space there.

In the dim light I couldn\u2019t spot anything that could have made the metallic noise, either.", "Humming the catchy chorus of \u201cTen Tap Tim,\u201d I crawled through to the other end of the hedge. Only when I came through the other side did I notice the drainage grate. I\u2019d seen similar ones scattered throughout the University, but this one was older and larger. In fact, the opening might be large enough for a person to fit through, if the grate were removed.", "Hesitantly, I curled a hand around one of the cool metal bars and pulled. The heavy grate pivoted on a hinge and came up about three inches before stopping. In the dim light I couldn\u2019t tell why it wouldn\u2019t go any farther. I pulled harder, but couldn\u2019t budge it. Finally I gave up and dropped it back into place. It made a hard noise, vaguely metallic. Like someone had dropped a heavy bar of iron.", "Then my fingers felt something that my eyes missed: a maze of grooves etching the surface of the bars. I looked closer and recognized some of the runes I was learning under Cammar: ule and dock.", "Then something clicked in my head. The chorus of \u201cTen Tap Tim\u201d suddenly fit together with the runes I\u2019d been studying under Cammar for the last handful of days.", "Ule and doch are", "Both for binding", "Reh for seeking", "Kel for finding", "Gea key", "Teh lock", "Pesin water", "Resin rock", "", "", "Before I could go any further, sixth bell struck. The sound startled me from my reverie. But when I reached out to steady myself, my hand didn\u2019t come to rest on leaves and dirt. It touched something round and hard and smooth: a green apple.", "I emerged from the hedge and made my way to the northwest corner where the apple tree stood. No apples were on the ground. It was too early in the year for that. What\u2019s more, the iron grate was on the opposite side of the small courtyard. It couldn\u2019t have rolled that far. It must have been carried.", "Unsure of what to think, but knowing I was late for my evening shift in the Fishery, I climbed the apple tree, gathered up my lute, and hurried to Kilvin\u2019s shop.", "Later that night I fit the rest of the runes to music. It took a few hours, but when I was done it was like having a reference sheet in my head. The next day Cammar put me through an extensive two-hour examination, which I passed.", "", "For the next stage of my education in the Fishery, I was apprenticed to Manet, the old, wild-haired student I\u2019d met during my first days at the University. Manet had been attending the University for nearly thirty years, and everyone knew him as the eternal E\u2019lir. But despite the fact that we held the same rank, Manet had more hands-on experience in the Fishery than any dozen higher-ranking students combined.", "Manet was patient and considerate. In fact, he reminded me of my old teacher, Abenthy. Except Abenthy had wandered the world like a restless tinker, and it was common knowledge that Manet desired nothing more than to stay at the University for the rest of his life if he could manage it.", "Manet started small, teaching me simple formulae of the sort required for twice-tough glass and heat funnels. Under his tutelage, I learned artificing as quickly as I learned everything, and it wasn\u2019t long before we worked our way up to more complex projects like heat-eaters and sympathy lamps.", "Truly high-level artificing such as sympathy clocks or gearwins were still beyond my reach, but I knew that it was just a matter of time. Unfortunately, time was proving to be in short supply.", "", "", ""], "CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO": ["CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO", "Burning", "\nOwning a lute again meant I had my music back, but I quickly realized I was three years out of practice. My work in the Artificery over the last couple months had toughened and strengthened my hands, but not in entirely the right ways. It took several frustrating days before I could play comfortably for even an hour at a time.", "I might have progressed more quickly had I not been so busy with my other studies. I had two hours of each day in the Medica, running or standing, an average of two hours of lecture and ciphering each day in Mathematics, and three hours of studying under Manet in the Fishery, learning the tricks of the trade.", "And then there was advanced sympathy with Elxa Dal. Out of class, Elxa Dal was charming, soft-spoken, and even a little ridiculous when the mood was on him. But when he taught, his personality strode back and forth between mad prophet and galley-slave drummer. Every day in his class I burned another three hours of time and five hours worth of energy.", "Combined with my paid work in Kilvin\u2019s shop, this left me with barely enough time to eat, sleep, and study, let alone give my lute the time it deserved.", "Music is a proud, temperamental mistress. Give her the time and attention she deserves, and she is yours. Slight her and there will come a day when you call and she will not answer. So I began sleeping less to give her the time she needed.", "After a span of this schedule, I was tired. After three span I was still fine, but only through a grim, set-jaw type of determination. Somewhere around the fifth span I began to show definite signs of wear.", "", "It was during that fifth span that I was enjoying a rare, shared lunch with Wilem and Simmon. They had their lunches from a nearby tavern. I couldn\u2019t afford a drab for an apple and meat pie, so I had snuck some barley bread and a gristly sausage out of the Mess.", "We sat on the stone bench beneath the pennant pole where I\u2019d been whipped. The place had filled me with dread after my whipping, but I forced myself to spend time there to prove to myself that I could. After it no longer unnerved me, I sat there because the stares of the students amused me. Now I sat there because I was comfortable. It was my place.", "And, because we spent a fair amount of time together, it had become Wilem and Simmon\u2019s place too. If they thought my choice an odd one, they didn\u2019t speak of it.", "\u201cYou haven\u2019t been around very much,\u201d Wilem said around a mouthful of meat pie. \u201cBeen sick?\u201d", "\u201cRight,\u201d Simmon said sarcastically \u201cHe\u2019s been sick a whole month.\u201d", "Wilem glared at him and grumbled, reminding me of Kilvin for a moment.", "His expression made Simmon laugh. \u201cWil\u2019s more polite than I am. I\u2019m betting you\u2019ve been spending all your free hours walking to Imre and back. Courting some fabulously attractive young bard.\u201d He gestured at the lute case that lay at my side.", "\u201cHe looks like he\u2019s been sick.\u201d Wilem looked at me with a critical eye. \u201cYour woman hasn\u2019t been taking care of you.\u201d", "\u201cHe\u2019s lovesick,\u201d Simmon said knowingly. \u201cCan\u2019t eat. Can\u2019t sleep. You think of her when you should be trying to memorize your cipher.\u201d", "I couldn\u2019t think of anything to say.", "\u201cSee?\u201d Simmon said to Wil. \u201cShe\u2019s stolen his tongue as well as his heart. All his words are for her. He can spare none for us.\u201d", "\u201cCan\u2019t spare any time, either,\u201d Wilem said into his rapidly dwindling meat pie.", "It was true of course\u2014I had been neglecting my friends even more than I had been neglecting myself. I felt a flush of guilt wash over me. I couldn\u2019t tell them the full truth, that I needed to make the most of this term because it would very likely be my last. I was flat broke.", "If you cannot understand why I couldn\u2019t bring myself to tell them this, then I doubt you have ever been truly poor. I doubt you can really understand how embarrassing it is to only own two shirts, to cut your own hair as best you can because you can\u2019t afford a barber. I lost a button and couldn\u2019t spare a shim to buy a matching one. I tore out the knee of my pants and had to make due with the wrong color thread for mending. I couldn\u2019t afford salt for my meals, or drinks on my rare evenings out with friends.", "The money I earned in Kilvin\u2019s shop was spent on essentials: ink, soap, lute strings ... the only other thing I could afford was pride. I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of my two best friends knowing how desperate my situation was.", "If I suffered a piece of extraordinary good luck I might be able to muster two talents to pay the interest on my debt to Devi. But it would require a direct act of God for me to somehow gather enough money to pay that and next term\u2019s tuition as well. After I was forced out of the University and squared my debt with Devi, I didn\u2019t know what I\u2019d do. Pull up stakes and head for Anilin to look for Denna, perhaps.", "I looked at them, not knowing what to say \u201cWil, Simmon, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve been so busy lately.\u201d", "Simmon grew a little more serious, and I saw that he was earnestly hurt at my unexplained absence. \u201cWe\u2019re busy too, you know. I\u2019ve got rhetoric and chemistry and I\u2019m learning Siaru.\u201d He turned to Wil and scowled. \u201cYou should know I\u2019m beginning to hate your language, you shim bastard.\u201d", "\u201cTu kralim,\u201d the young Ceald replied amiably.", "Simmon turned back to me, and spoke with remarkable candor. \u201cIt\u2019s just that we\u2019d like to see you more often than once every handful of days as you run from Mains to the Fishery. Girls are wonderful, I\u2019ll admit, but when one takes one of my friends away, I get a little jealous.\u201d He gave a sudden, sunny smile. \u201cNot that I think of you in that way, of course.\u201d", "I found it hard to swallow past the sudden lump in my throat. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019d been missed. For a long time, I hadn\u2019t had anyone to miss me. I felt the beginning of hot tears in the back of my throat. \u201cReally, there isn\u2019t a girl. I mean it.\u201d I swallowed hard trying to regain my composure.", "\u201cSim, I think we\u2019ve been missing something here.\u201d Wilem was looking at me oddly. \u201cTake a good look at him.\u201d", "Simmon gave me a similar, analytical stare. That look from the two of them was enough to unnerve me, pushing me back from the edge of tears.", "\u201cNow,\u201d Wilem said as if lecturing. \u201cHow many terms has our young E\u2019lir been attending the University?\u201d", "Realization poured into Sim\u2019s honest face. \u201cOh.\u201d", "\u201cAnyone care to tell me?\u201d I said petulantly.", "Wilem ignored my question. \u201cWhat classes are you taking?\u201d", "\u201cEverything,\u201d I said, glad to have an excuse to complain. \u201cGeometry, Observation in the Medica, Advanced Sympathy with Elxa Dal, and I\u2019ve got my apprenticeship under Manet in the Fishery.\u201d", "Simmon looked a little shocked. \u201cNo wonder you look like you haven\u2019t slept in a span of days,\u201d he said.", "Wilem nodded to himself. \u201cAnd you\u2019re still working in Kilvin\u2019s shop, aren\u2019t you?\u201d", "\u201cA couple hours every night.\u201d", "Simmon was aghast. \u201cAnd you\u2019re learning an instrument at the same time? Are you insane?\u201d", "\u201cThe music is the only thing that keeps me grounded,\u201d I said, reaching down to touch my lute. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not learning to play. I just need practice.\u201d", "Wilem and Simmon exchanged looks. \u201cHow long do you think he has?\u201d", "Simmon looked me over. \u201cSpan and a half, tops.\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d", "Wilem leaned forward. \u201cWe all bite off too much sooner or later. But some students don\u2019t know when to spit their mouthful. They burn out. They quit, or botch their exams. Some crack.\u201d He tapped his head. \u201cIt usually happens to students in their first year.\u201d He gave me a significant look.", "\u201cI haven\u2019t bitten off too much,\u201d I said.", "\u201cLook in a mirror,\u201d Wilem suggested frankly.", "I opened my mouth to reassure Wil and Sim that I was fine, but just then I heard the hour being struck, and I only had time for a hurried good-bye. Even so, I had to run to make it to Advanced Sympathy on time.", "Elxa Dal stood between two medium sized braziers. In his well-trimmed beard and dark master\u2019s robe, he still reminded me of the stereotypical evil magician that appears in so many bad Aturan plays. \u201cWhat each of you must remember is that the sympathist is tied to flame,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are its master and its servant.\u201d", "He tucked his hands into his long sleeves and began to pace again. \u201cWe are the masters of fire, for we have dominion over it.\u201d Elxa Dal struck a nearby brazier with the flat of his hand, making it ring softly. Flames kindled in the coal and began to lick hungrily upward. \u201cThe energy in all things belongs to the arcanist. We command fire and fire obeys.\u201d Dal walked slowly to the other corner of the room. The brazier at his back dimmed while the one he walked toward sparked to life and began to burn. I appreciated his showmanship.", "Dal stopped and faced the class again. \u201cBut we are also servants of fire. Because fire is the most common form of energy, and without energy, our prowess as sympathists is of little use.\u201d He turned his back to the class and began erasing formulae from the slate board. \u201cGather your materials, and we\u2019ll see who has to knock heads with E\u2019lir Kvothe today.\u201d He began to chalk up a list of all the student\u2019s names. Mine was at the top.", "Three span ago, Dal had started making us compete against each other. He called it dueling. And though it was a welcome break from the monotony of lecture, this most recent activity had a sinister element too.", "A hundred students left the Arcanum every year, perhaps a quarter of them with their guilders. That meant that every year there were a hundred more people in the world that had been trained in the use of sympathy. People who, for one reason or another, you might have to pit your will against later in life. Though Dal never said as much, we knew we were being taught something beyond mere concentration and ingenuity. We were being taught how to fight.", "Elxa Dal kept careful track of the results. In the class of thirty-eight, I was the only one to remain undefeated. By this point, even the most thickheaded and grudging students were being forced to admit that my quick admittance to the Arcanum was something other than a fluke.", "Dueling could also be profitable in a small way, as there was a bit of clandestine betting. When we wanted to bet on our own duels, Sovoy and I placed bets for each other. Though as a rule I usually didn\u2019t have much money to spare.", "Thus it was no coincidence that Sovoy and I bumped into each other while we were gathering our materials. I handed him two jots underneath the table.", "He slid them into his pocket without looking at me. \u201cGoodness,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cSomeone\u2019s pretty confident today.\u201d", "I shrugged nonchalantly, though in truth I was a little nervous. I had started the term penniless, and been scraping by ever since. But yesterday Kilvin had paid me for a span\u2019s work in the Fishery: two jots. All the money I had in the world.", "Sovoy began to rummage around in a drawer, bringing out sympathy wax, twine, and a few pieces of metal. \u201cI don\u2019t know how well I\u2019ll be able to do for you. The odds are getting bad. I\u2019m guessing three to one is the best you\u2019ll get today You still interested if it gets that low?\u201d", "I sighed. The odds were the down side to my undefeated rank. Yesterday they had been two to one, meaning I would have had to risk two pennies for the chance to win one. \u201cI\u2019ve got a little something planned,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t bet until we\u2019ve set terms. You should get at least three to one against me.\u201d", "\u201cAgainst you?\u201d he muttered as he gathered up an armful of paraphernalia. \u201cNot unless you\u2019re going up against Dal.\u201d I turned my face to conceal a slightly embarrassed blush at the compliment.", "Dal clapped his hands and everyone rushed to take their proper place. I was paired with a Vintish boy, Fenton. He was one step below me in the class ranking. I respected him as one of the few in the class that could pose a real challenge to me in the right situation.", "\u201cRight then,\u201d Elxa Dal said, rubbing his hands together eagerly \u201cFenton, you\u2019re lower on the ranks, pick your poison.\u201d", "\u201cCandles.\u201d", "\u201cAnd your link?\u201d Dal asked ritualistically With candles it was always either wicking or wax.", "\u201cWick.\u201d He held up a piece for everyone to see.", "Dal turned to me. \u201cLink?\u201d", "I dug into a pocket, and held up my link with a flourish. \u201cStraw.\u201d There was a murmur from the class at this. It was a ridiculous link. The best I could hope for is a three percent transfer, maybe five. Fenton\u2019s wicking would be ten times better.", "\u201cStraw?\u201d", "\u201cStraw,\u201d I said with slightly more confidence than I felt. If this didn\u2019t tip the odds against me I didn\u2019t know what would.", "\u201cStraw it is then,\u201d Dal said easily. \u201cE\u2019lir Fenton, since Kvothe is undefeated you will have the choice of source.\u201d A quiet laugh spread through the class.", "My stomach dropped. I hadn\u2019t expected that. Normally, whoever doesn\u2019t pick the game gets to choose the source. I had been planning on choosing brazier, knowing that the quantity of heat would help offset my self-imposed handicap.", "Fenton grinned, knowing his advantage. \u201cNo source.\u201d", "I grimaced. All we would have to draw from was our own body heat. Difficult in the best of circumstances, not to mention a little dangerous.", "I couldn\u2019t win. Not only was I going to lose my perfect rank, I had no way to signal Sovoy not to bet my last two jots. I tried to meet his eyes, but he was already caught up in quiet, intense negotiations with a handful of other students.", "Fenton and I moved wordlessly to sit on opposite sides of a large work-table. Elxa Dal set two thick stumps of candle down, one in front of each of us. The object was to light your opponent\u2019s candle without letting him do the same to yours. This involved splitting your mind into two different pieces, one piece tried to hold the Alar that your piece of wicking (or straw, if you were stupid) was the same as the wick of the candle you were trying to light. Then you drew energy from your source to make it happen.", "Meanwhile the second piece of your mind was kept busy trying to maintain the belief that your opponent\u2019s piece of wicking was not the same as the wick of your candle.", "If all of this sounds difficult, believe me, you don\u2019t know the half of it.", "Making it worse was the fact that neither of us had an easy source to draw from. You had to be careful using yourself as source. Your body is warm for a reason. It responds badly when its heat is pulled away.", "At a gesture from Elxa Dal, we began. I immediately devoted my whole mind to the defense of my own candle and began to think furiously. There was no way I could win. It doesn\u2019t matter how skilled a fencer you are, you can\u2019t help but lose when your opponent has a blade of Ramston steel and you\u2019ve chosen to fight with a willow switch.", "I lowered myself into the Heart of Stone. Then, still devoting most of my mind to the protection of my candle, I muttered a binding between my candle and his. I reached out and tipped my candle on its side, forcing him to make a grab for his before it did the same and rolled away.", "I tried to take quick advantage of his distraction and set his candle aflame. I threw myself into it and felt a chill bleed up my arm from my right hand that held the piece of straw. Nothing happened. His candle remained cold and dark.", "I cupped my hand around the wick of my candle, blocking his line of sight. It was a petty trick, and largely useless against a skilled sympathist but my only hope was to rattle him in some way", "\u201cHey Fen,\u201d I said. \u201cHave you heard the one about the tinker, the Tehlin, the farmer\u2019s daughter, and the butter churn yet?\u201d", "Fen gave no response. His pale face was locked in fierce concentration.", "I gave up distraction as a lost cause. Fenton was too smart to be thrown off that way. Besides, I was finding it difficult to maintain the necessary concentration to keep my candle safe. I lowered myself more deeply into the Heart of Stone and forgot the world apart from the two candles and a piece of wick and straw.", "After a minute I was covered in a clammy chill sweat. I shivered. Fenton saw this and gave me a smile with bloodless lips. I redoubled my efforts, but his candle ignored my best attempts to force it into flame.", "Five minutes passed with the whole class quiet as stones. Most duels lasted no longer than a minute or two, one person quickly proving himself more clever or possessed of a stronger will. Both my arms were cold now. I saw a muscle in Fenton\u2019s neck twitch spastically, like a horse\u2019s flank trying to shake loose a biting fly. His posture went rigid as he suppressed the urge to shiver. A wisp of smoke began to curl from the wick of my candle.", "I bore down. I realized that my breath was hissing through my clenched teeth, my lips pulled back in a feral grin. Fenton didn\u2019t seem to notice, his eyes growing glassy and unfocused. I shivered again, so violently that I almost missed seeing the tremor in his hand. Then, slowly, Fenton\u2019s head began to nod toward the tabletop. His eyelids drooped. I set my teeth and was rewarded to see a thin curl of smoke rise from the wick of his candle.", "Woodenly, Fenton turned to look, but instead of rallying to his own defense he made a slow, leaden gesture of dismissal and lay his head in the crook of his arm.", "He didn\u2019t look up as the candle near his elbow spat fitfully to life. There was a brief scattering of applause mixed in with exclamations of disbelief.", "Someone pounded me on the back. \u201cHow bout that? Wore himself out.\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d I said thickly and reached across the table. With clumsy fingers I prized open the hand that held the wicking and saw it had blood on it. \u201cMaster Dal,\u201d I said as quickly as I could manage. \u201cHe\u2019s got the chills.\u201d Speaking made me realize how cold my lips felt.", "But Dal was already there, bringing a blanket to wrap around the boy. \u201cYou.\u201d He pointed at one of the students at random. \u201cBring someone from the Medica. Go!\u201d The student left at a run. \u201cFoolish,\u201d Master Dal murmured a binding for heat. He looked over at me. \u201cYou should probably walk around a bit. You don\u2019t look much better than he does.\u201d", "There was no more dueling that day. The rest of the class watched as Fenton revived slowly under Elxa Dai\u2019s care. By the time an older El\u2019the from the Medica arrived, Fenton had warmed enough to begin shivering violently. After a quarter hour of warm blankets and careful sympathy, Fenton was able to drink something hot, though his hands still shook.", "Once all the hubbub was finished, it was nearly third bell. Master Dal managed to get all the students seated and quiet long enough to say a few words.", "\u201cWhat we saw today was a prime example of binder\u2019s chills. The body is a delicate thing and a few degrees of heat lost rapidly can upset the entire system. A mild case of chills is just that, chilling. But more extreme cases can lead to shock and hypothermia.\u201d Dal looked around. \u201cCan anyone tell me what Fenton\u2019s mistake was?\u201d There was a moment of silence, then a hand raised. \u201cYes Brae?\u201d", "\u201cHe used blood. When heat is lost from the blood, the body cools as a whole unit. This is not always advantageous, as the extremities can stand a more drastic temperature loss than the viscera can.\u201d", "\u201cWhy would anyone consider using blood then?\u201d", "\u201cIt offers up more heat more rapidly than the flesh.\u201d", "\u201cHow much would have been safe for him to draw?\u201d Dal looked around the room.", "\u201cTwo degrees?\u201d someone volunteered.", "\u201cOne and a half,\u201d Dal corrected, and wrote a few equations on the board to demonstrate how much heat this would provide. \u201cGiven his symptoms, how much do you suppose he actually drew?\u201d", "There was a pause. Finally Sovoy spoke up, \u201cEight or nine.\u201d", "\u201cVery good,\u201d Dal said grudgingly. \u201cIt\u2019s nice that at least one of you has been doing the reading.\u201d His expression grew grave. \u201cSympathy is not for the weak of mind, but neither is it for the overconfident. If we had not been here to give Fenton the care he needed, he would have slipped quietly asleep and died.\u201d He paused to let the words sink in. \u201cBetter you should know your honest limit than overguess your abilities and lose control.\u201d", "Third bell struck, and the room was filled with sudden noise as students stood to leave. Master Dal raised his voice to be heard. \u201cE\u2019lir Kvothe, would you mind staying behind for a moment?\u201d", "I grimaced. Sovoy walked behind me, clapped me on the shoulder, and muttered, \u201cLuck.\u201d I couldn\u2019t tell if he was referring to my victory or wishing me well.", "After everyone was gone, Dal turned and set down the rag he had been using to wipe the slate clean. \u201cSo,\u201d he said conversationally \u201cHow did the numbers work out?\u201d", "I wasn\u2019t surprised he knew about the betting. \u201cEleven to one,\u201d I admitted. I\u2019d made twenty-two jots. A little over two talents. The presence of that money in my pocket warmed me.", "He gave me a speculative look. \u201cHow\u2019re you feeling? You were a little pale at the end yourself.\u201d", "\u201cI had a little shiver,\u201d I lied.", "Actually, in the commotion that followed Fenton\u2019s collapse I had slipped out and had a frightening few minutes in a back hallway. Shivers that were close to seizures had made it almost impossible to stay on my feet. Luckily, no one had found me shaking in the hallway, my jaw clenched so tight that I feared my teeth might break.", "But no one had seen me. My reputation was intact.", "Dal gave me a look that told me he might suspect the truth. \u201cCome over,\u201d he made a motion to one of the still-burning braziers. \u201cA little warm won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d", "I didn\u2019t argue. As I held my hands to the fire, I felt myself relax a bit. Suddenly I realized how weary I was. My eyes were itchy from too little sleep. My body felt heavy, as if my bones were made of lead.", "With a reluctant sigh I pulled my hands back and opened my eyes. Dal was looking closely at my face. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go.\u201d I said with a little regret in my voice. \u201cThanks for the use of your fire.\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019re both sympathists,\u201d Dal said, giving me a friendly wave as I gathered my things and headed for the door. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to it any time.\u201d", "Later that night in the Mews, Wilem opened his door to my knocking. \u201cI\u2019ll be dammed,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo times in one day. To what do I owe the honor?\u201d", "\u201cI think you know,\u201d I grumbled and pushed my way inside the cell-like little room. I leaned my lute case against a wall and fell into a chair. \u201cKilvin has banned me from my work in the shop.\u201d", "Wilem sat forward on his bed. \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d", "I gave him a knowing look. \u201cI expect it\u2019s because you and Simmon stopped by and suggested it to him.\u201d", "He watched me for a moment, then shrugged. \u201cYou figured it out quicker than I thought you would.\u201d He rubbed the side of his face. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem terribly upset.\u201d", "I had been furious. Just as my fortune seemed to be turning, I was forced to leave my only paying job because of well-intentioned meddling by my friends. But rather than storm over and rage at them, I\u2019d gone away to the roof of Mains and played for a while to cool my head.", "My music calmed me, as it always did. And while I played, I thought things through. My apprenticeship with Manet was going well, but there was simply too much to learn: how to fire the kilns, how to draw wire to the proper consistency, which alloys to choose for the proper effects. I couldn\u2019t hope to bull through it the way I had learning my runes. I couldn\u2019t earn enough working in Kilvin\u2019s shop to pay back Devi at the end of the month, let alone make enough for tuition too.", "\u201cI probably would be,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut Kilvin made me look in a mirror.\u201d I gave him a tired smile. \u201cI look like hell.\u201d", "\u201cYou look like beat-up hell,\u201d he corrected me matter-of-factly, then paused awkwardly \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re not upset.\u201d", "Simmon knocked as he pushed the door open. Guilt chased surprise off his face when he saw me sitting there. \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be, um, in the Fishery?\u201d he asked lamely.", "I laughed and Simmon\u2019s relief was almost tangible. Wilem moved a stack of paper off another chair and Simmon slouched into it.", "\u201cAll is forgiven,\u201d I said magnanimously. \u201cAll I ask is this: tell me everything you know about the Eolian.\u201d", "", "", ""], "CHAPTER FIFTY-THREE": ["CHAPTER FIFTY-THREE", "Slow Circles", "\nThe Eolian is where our long-sought player is waiting in the wings. I have not forgotten that she is what I am moving toward. If I seem to be caught in a slow circling of the subject, it is only appropriate, as she and I have always moved toward each other in slow circles.", "Luckily, Wilem and Simmon had both been to the Eolian. Together they told me what little I didn\u2019t already know.", "There were a lot of places you could go in Imre to listen to music. In fact, nearly every inn, tavern, and boarding house had some manner of musician strumming, singing, or piping in the background. But the Eolian was different. It hosted the best musicians in the city. If you knew good music from bad, you knew the Eolian had the best.", "To get in the front door of the Eolian cost you a whole copper jot. Once you were inside you could stay as long as you wished, and listen to as much music as you liked.", "But paying at the door did not give a musician the right to play at the Eolian. A musician who wished to set foot upon the Eolian\u2019s stage had to pay for the privilege: one silver talent. That\u2019s right, folk paid to play at the Eolian, not the other way around.", "Why would anyone pay such an outrageous amount of money simply to play music? Well, some of those who gave their silver were simply the self-indulgent rich. To them, a talent was not a great price to set themselves on such proud display.", "But serious musicians paid too. If your performance impressed the audience and the owners enough, you were given a token: a tiny set of silver pipes that could be mounted on a pin or necklace. Talent pipes were recognized as clear marks of distinction at most sizable inns within two hundred miles of Imre.", "If you had your set of talent pipes, you were admitted to the Eolian for free and could play whenever the fancy took you.", "The only responsibility the talent pipes carried was that of performance. If you had earned your pipes, you could be called upon to play This was usually not a heavy burden, as the nobility who frequented the Eolian usually gave money or gifts to performers who pleased them. It was the upper class version of buying drinks for the fiddler.", "Some musicians played with little hope of actually gaining their pipes. They paid to play because you never knew who might be in the Eolian that night, listening. A good performance of a single song might not get you your pipes, but it might earn you a wealthy patron instead.", "A patron.", "", "\u201cYou\u2019ll never guess what I heard,\u201d Simmon said one evening as we sat on our usual bench in the pennant square. We were alone, as Wilem was off making eyes at a serving girl at Anker\u2019s. \u201cStudents have been hearing all manner of odd things from Mains at night.\u201d", "\u201cReally,\u201d I feigned disinterest.", "Simmon pressed on. \u201cYes. Some say that it\u2019s the ghost of a student who got lost in the building and starved to death.\u201d He tapped the side of his nose with a finger like an old gaffer telling a story. \u201cThey say he wanders the halls even to this day, never able to find his way outside.\u201d", "\u201cAh.\u201d", "\u201cOther opinions suggest it\u2019s an angry spirit. They say it tortures animals, especially cats. That\u2019s the sound the students hear, late at night: tortured cat\u2019s guts. Quite a terrifying sound, I understand.\u201d", "I looked at him. He seemed almost ready to burst with laughing. \u201cOh let it out,\u201d I told him with mock severity. \u201cGo on. You deserve it for being so terribly clever. Despite the fact that no one uses gut strings in this day and age.\u201d", "He chortled delightedly to himself. I picked up one of his sweetcakes and began to eat it, hoping to teach him a valuable lesson in humility.", "\u201cSo you\u2019re still going at it?\u201d", "I nodded.", "Simmon looked relieved. \u201cI thought you might have changed your plans. I hadn\u2019t seen you carrying your lute around lately\u201d", "\u201cNot necessary,\u201d I explained. \u201cNow that I have time to practice I don\u2019t have to worry about sneaking in a few minutes whenever I can grab them.\u201d", "A group of students passed by, one of them waved to Simmon. \u201cWhen are you going to do it?\u201d", "\u201cThis Mourning,\u201d I said.", "\u201cSo soon?\u201d Sim asked. \u201cIt was only two span ago that you were worried about being rusty. Has it all come back so quickly?\u201d", "\u201cNot all of it,\u201d I admitted. \u201cIt\u2019ll take years for it to all come back.\u201d I shrugged and popped the last of the sweetcake into my mouth. \u201cBut it\u2019s easy again. The music doesn\u2019t stop in my hands any more, it just\u2014\u201d I struggled to explain, then shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d", "Honestly, I would have liked another month\u2019s practice, another year\u2019s practice before gambling away an entire talent. But there was no time. The term was nearly over. I needed money to stave off my debt to Devi and pay my upcoming tuition. I couldn\u2019t wait any longer.", "\u201cYou sure?\u201d Sim asked. \u201cI\u2019ve heard people try for their talent that were really good. Early this term an old man sang a song about ... about this woman whose husband had gone off to war.\u201d", "\u201c \u2018In the Village Smithy\u2019 \u201d I said.", "\u201cWhatever,\u201d Simmon said dismissively \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is that he was really good. I laughed and cried and just hurt all over.\u201d He gave me an anxious look. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t get his pipes.\u201d", "I covered my own anxiety with a smile. \u201cYou still haven\u2019t heard me play, have you?\u201d", "\u201cYou know damn well I haven\u2019t,\u201d he said crossly.", "I smiled. I had refused to play for Wilem and Simmon while I was out of practice. Their opinions were nearly as important as those at the Eolian.", "\u201cWell, you\u2019ll get your chance this Mourning,\u201d I teased. \u201cWill you come?\u201d", "Simmon nodded. \u201cWilem too. Barring earthquakes or a rain of blood.\u201d", "I looked up at the sunset. \u201cI should go,\u201d I said, getting to my feet. \u201cPractice makes the master.\u201d", "Sim waved and I headed to the Mess, where I sat down long enough to spoon up my beans and chew through a flat piece of tough grey meat. I took my small loaf of bread with me, drawing a few odd looks from the nearby students.", "I headed to my bunk and retrieved my lute from the trunk at the foot of the bed. Then, given the rumors Sim had mentioned, I took one of the trickier ways onto the roof of Mains, shimmying up a series of drainpipes in a sheltered box alley I didn\u2019t want to draw any extra attention to my nighttime activities there.", "It was fully dark by the time I made it to the isolated courtyard with the apple tree. All the windows were dark. I looked down from the edge of the roof, seeing nothing but shadows.", "\u201cAuri,\u201d I called. \u201cAre you there?\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d came the vaguely petulant reply.", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you want to come up tonight?\u201d", "A slight pause. \u201cNo. Come down.\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s not much moon tonight,\u201d I said in my best encouraging tones. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to come up?\u201d", "I heard a rustle from the hedges below and then saw Auri scamper up the tree like a squirrel. She ran around the edge of the roof, then pulled up short a few dozen feet away.", "At my best guess, Auri was only a few years older than me, certainly no more than twenty. She dressed in tattered clothes that left her arms and legs bare, was shorter than me by almost a foot. She was thin. Part of this was simply her tiny frame, but there was more to it than that. Her cheeks were hollow and her bare arms waifishly narrow. Her long hair was so fine that it trailed her, floating in the air like a cloud.", "It had taken me a long while to draw her out of hiding. I\u2019d suspected someone was listening to me practice from the courtyard, but it had been nearly two span before I caught a glimpse of her. Seeing that she was half-starved, I began bringing whatever food I could carry away from the Mess and leaving it for her. Even so, it was another span before she had joined me on the roof as I practiced my lute.", "The last few days, she\u2019d even started talking. I\u2019d expected her to be sullen and suspicious, but nothing could be further from the truth. She was bright-eyed and enthusiastic. Though I couldn\u2019t help but be reminded of myself in Tarbean when I saw her, there was little real resemblance. Auri was scrupulously clean and full of joy.", "She didn\u2019t like the open sky, or bright lights, or people. I guessed she was some student who had gone cracked and run underground before she could be confined to Haven. I hadn\u2019t learned much about her, as she was still shy and skittish. When I\u2019d asked her name, she bolted back underground and didn\u2019t return for days.", "So I picked a name for her, Auri. Though in my heart I thought of her as my little moon-fey.", "Auri came a few steps closer, stopped, waited, then darted forward again. She did this several times until she stood in front of me. Standing still, her hair spread in the air around her like a halo. She held both her hands in front of her, just under her chin. She reached out and tugged my sleeve, then pulled her hand back. \u201cWhat did you bring me?\u201d She asked excitedly", "I smiled. \u201cWhat did you bring me?\u201d I teased gently.", "She smiled and thrust her hand forward. Something gleamed in the moonlight. \u201cA key,\u201d she said proudly, pressing it on me.", "I took it. It had a pleasing weight in my hand. \u201cIt\u2019s very nice,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat does it unlock?\u201d", "\u201cThe moon,\u201d she said, her expression grave.", "\u201cThat should be useful,\u201d I said, looking it over.", "\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d she said. \u201cThat way, if there\u2019s a door in the moon you can open it.\u201d She sat cross-legged on the roof and grinned up at me. \u201cNot that I would encourage that sort of reckless behavior.\u201d", "I squatted down and opened my lute case. \u201cI brought you some bread.\u201d I handed her the loaf of brown barley bread wrapped in a piece of cloth. \u201cAnd a bottle of water.\u201d", "\u201cThis is very nice as well,\u201d she said graciously The bottle seemed very large in her hands. \u201cWhat\u2019s in the water?\u201d she asked as she pulled out the cork and peered down into it.", "\u201cFlowers,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd the part of the moon that isn\u2019t in the sky tonight. I put that in there too.\u201d", "She looked back up. \u201cI already said the moon,\u201d she said with a hint of reproach.", "\u201cJust flowers then. And the shine off the back of a dragonfly. I wanted a piece of the moon, but blue-dragonfly-shine was as close as I could get.\u201d", "She tipped the bottle up and took a sip. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely,\u201d she said, brushing back several strands of hair that were drifting in front of her face.", "Auri spread out the cloth and began to eat. She tore small pieces from the loaf and chewed them delicately, somehow making the whole process look genteel.", "\u201cI like white bread,\u201d she said conversationally between mouthfuls.", "\u201cMe too,\u201d I said as I lowered myself into a sitting position. \u201cWhen I can get it.\u201d", "She nodded and looked around at the starry night sky and the crescent moon. \u201cI like it when it\u2019s cloudy, too. But this is okay It\u2019s cozy. Like the Underthing.\u201d", "\u201cUnderthing?\u201d I asked. She was rarely this talkative.", "\u201cI live in the Underthing,\u201d Auri said easily. \u201cIt goes all over.\u201d", "\u201cDo you like it down there?\u201d", "Auri\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cHoly God yes, it\u2019s marvelous. You can just look forever.\u201d She turned to look at me. \u201cI have news,\u201d she said teasingly", "\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I asked.", "She took another bite and finished chewing before she spoke. \u201cI went out last night.\u201d A sly smile. \u201cOn top of things.\u201d", "\u201cReally?\u201d I said, not bothering to hide my surprise. \u201cHow did you like it?\u201d", "\u201cIt was lovely. I went looking around,\u201d she said, obviously pleased with herself. \u201cI saw Elodin.\u201d", "\u201cMaster Elodin?\u201d I asked. She nodded. \u201cWas he on top of things, too?\u201d", "She nodded again, chewing.", "\u201cDid he see you?\u201d", "Her smile burst out again making her look closer to eight than eighteen. \u201cNobody sees me. Besides, he was busy listening to the wind.\u201d She cupped her hands around her mouth and made a hooting noise. \u201cThere was good wind for listening last night,\u201d she added confidentially.", "While I was trying to make sense of what she\u2019d said, Auri finished the last of her bread and clapped her hands excitedly. \u201cNow play!\u201d she said breathlessly. \u201cPlay! Play!\u201d", "Grinning, I pulled my lute out of its case.

Don\u2019t do anything stupid and everything should be fine.\u201d", "\u201cThanks,\u201d I said sarcastically as I pushed my chair back from the table and stood.", "Stanchion had a medium build and was handsomely dressed in deep green and black. He had a round, bearded face and a slight paunch that was probably only noticeable because he was sitting. He smiled and motioned me forward with the hand that wasn\u2019t holding an impressively tall tankard.", "\u201cHo there,\u201d he said cheerily \u201cYou have the hopeful look about you. Are you here to play for us tonight?\u201d He raised a speculative eyebrow. Now that I was closer, I noticed that Stanchion\u2019s hair was a deep, bashful red that hid if the light struck him the wrong way.", "\u201cI hope to, sir,\u201d I said. \u201cThough I was planning to wait for a while.\u201d", "\u201cOh, certainly. We never let anyone try their talent until the sun is down.\u201d He paused to take a drink, and as he turned his head I saw a golden set of pipes hanging from his ear.", "Sighing, he wiped his mouth happily across the back of his sleeve. \u201cWhat do you play then, lute?\u201d I nodded. \u201cHave any idea what you\u2019ll use to woo us?\u201d", "\u201cThat depends sir. Has anyone played \u2018The Lay of Sir Savien Traliard\u2019 lately?\u201d", "Stanchion raised an eyebrow and cleared his throat. Smoothing his beard with his free hand, he said, \u201cWell, no. Someone gave it a whirl a few months ago, but he bit off more than he could swallow whole. Missed a couple fingerings then fell apart.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cSimply said, no. Not lately.\u201d", "He took another drink from his tankard, and swallowed thoughtfully before he spoke again. \u201cMost people find that a song of more moderate difficulty allows them to showcase their talent,\u201d he said carefully.", "I sensed his unspoken advice and was not offended. \u201cSir Savien\u201d is the most difficult song I had ever heard. My father had been the only one in the troupe with the skill to perform it, and I had only heard him do it perhaps four or five times in front of an audience. It was only about fifteen minutes long, but those fifteen minutes required quick, precise fingering that, if done properly, would set two voices singing out of the lute at once, both a melody and a harmony.", "That was tricky, but nothing any skilled lutist couldn\u2019t accomplish. However, \u201cSir Savien\u201d was a ballad, and the vocal part was a counter melody that ran against the timing of the lute. Difficult. If the song was being done properly, with both a man and a woman alternating the verses, the song was further complicated by the female\u2019s counter harmony in the refrains. If it is done well, it is enough to cut a heart. Unfortunately, few musicians could perform calmly in the center of such a storm of song.", "Stanchion drank off another solid swallow from his tankard and wiped his beard on his sleeve. \u201cYou singing alone?\u201d he asked, seeming a bit excited in spite of his half-spoken warning. \u201cOr have you brought someone to sing opposite you? Is one of the boys you came in with a castrati?\u201d", "I fought down laughter at the thought of Wilem as a soprano and shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t have any friends that can sing it. I was going to double the third refrain to give someone the chance to come in as Aloine.\u201d", "\u201cTrouper style, eh?\u201d He gave me a serious look. \u201cSon, it\u2019s really not my place to say this, but do you really want to try for your pipes with someone you\u2019ve never even practiced with?\u201d", "It reassured me that he realized how hard it was going to be. \u201cHow many pipes will be here tonight, roughly?\u201d", "He thought briefly. \u201cRoughly? Eight. Maybe a dozen.\u201d", "\u201cSo in all likelihood there will be at least three women who have earned their talents?\u201d", "Stanchion nodded, watching me curiously.", "\u201cWell,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cIf what everyone has told me is true, if only real excellence can win the pipes, then one of those women will know Aloine\u2019s part.\u201d", "Stanchion took another long, slow drink, watching me over the top of his tankard. When he finally set it down he forgot to wipe his beard. \u201cYou\u2019re a proud one, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he said frankly.", "I looked around the room. \u201cIsn\u2019t this the Eolian? I had heard that this is where pride pays silver and plays golden.\u201d", "\u201cI like that,\u201d Stanchion said, almost to himself. \u201cPlays golden.\u201d He slammed his tankard down onto the bar, causing a small geyser of something frothy to erupt from the top. \u201cDammit boy, I hope you\u2019re as good as you seem to think you are. I could use someone else around here with Illien\u2019s fire.\u201d He ran a hand through his own red hair to clarify his double meaning.", "\u201cI hope this place is as good as everyone seems to think it is,\u201d I said earnestly. \u201cI need a place to burn.\u201d", "", "\u201cHe didn\u2019t throw you out,\u201d Simmon quipped as I returned to the table. \u201cSo I\u2019m guessing it didn\u2019t go as badly as it could have.\u201d", "\u201cI think it went well,\u201d I said distractedly. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure.\u201d", "\u201cHow can you not know?\u201d Simmon objected. \u201cI saw him laugh. That must mean something good.\u201d", "\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d Wilem said.", "\u201cI\u2019m trying to remember everything I said to him,\u201d I admitted. \u201cSometimes my mouth just starts talking and it takes my mind a little bit to catch up.\u201d", "\u201cThis happens often, does it?\u201d asked Wilem with one of his rare, quiet smiles.", "Their banter began to relax me. \u201cMore and more often,\u201d I confessed, grinning.", "We drank and joked about small things, rumors of the masters and the rare female students who caught our attention. We talked about who we liked in the University, but more time was spent mulling over who we didn\u2019t like, and why, and what we would do about it given the chance. Such is human nature.", "So time passed and the Eolian slowly filled. Simmon gave in to Wilem\u2019s taunting and began to drink scutten, a powerful black wine from the foothills of the Shalda mountains, more commonly called cut-tail.", "Simmon showed the effects almost immediately, laughing louder, grinning wider, and fidgeting in his seat. Wilem remained his same taciturn self. I bought the next round of drinks, making it large mugs of straight cider for each of us. I responded to Wilem\u2019s scowl by telling him that if I made my talent tonight, I would float him home in cut-tail, but if either of them got drunk on me before then, I would personally thrash them and drop them in the river. They settled down an appreciable amount, and began inventing obscene verses to \u201cTinker Tanner.\u201d", "I left them to it, retreating into my own thoughts. At the forefront of my mind was the fact that Stanchion\u2019s unspoken advice might be worth listening to. I tried to think of other songs I could perform that were difficult enough to show my skill, but easy enough to allow me room for artistry.", "Simmon\u2019s voice drew me back to the here and now. \u201cC\u2019mon, you\u2019re good at rhymes ...\u201d he urged me.", "I replayed the last bit of their conversation that I\u2019d been half listening to. \u201cTry \u2018in the Tehlin\u2019s cassock,\u2019 \u201d I suggested disinterestedly I was too nervous to bother explaining that one of my father\u2019s vices had been his propensity for dirty limericks.", "They chortled delightedly to themselves while I tried to come up with a different song to sing. I hadn\u2019t had much luck when Wilem distracted me again.", "\u201cWhat!\u201d I demanded angrily. Then I saw the flat look in Wilem\u2019s eyes that he only gets when he sees something he really doesn\u2019t like. \u201cWhat?\u201d I repeated, more reasonably this time.", "\u201cSomeone we all know and love,\u201d he said darkly, nodding in the direction of the door.", "I couldn\u2019t see anyone I recognized. The Eolian was nearly full, and over a hundred people milled about on the ground floor alone. I saw through the open door that night had settled outside.", "\u201cHis back is to us. He\u2019s working his oily charm on a lovely young lady who must not know him ... to the right of the round gentleman in red.\u201d Wilem directed my attention.", "\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d I said, too stunned for proper profanity.", "\u201cI\u2019ve always figured him for porcine parentage myself,\u201d Wilem said dryly", "Simmon looked around, blinking owlishly \u201cWhat? Who\u2019s here?\u201d", "\u201cAmbrose.\u201d", "\u201cGod\u2019s balls,\u201d Simmon said and hunched over the tabletop. \u201cThat\u2019s all I need. Haven\u2019t you two made nice yet?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m willing to leave him be,\u201d I protested. \u201cBut every time he sees me he can\u2019t help but make another jab in my direction.\u201d", "\u201cIt takes two to argue,\u201d Simmon said.", "\u201cLike hell,\u201d I retorted. \u201cI don\u2019t care whose son he is. I won\u2019t go belly-up like some timid pup. If he\u2019s fool enough to take a poke at me, I\u2019ll snap the finger clean off that does the poking.\u201d I took a breath to calm myself, and tried to sound rational. \u201cEventually, he\u2019ll learn to leave me well enough alone.\u201d", "\u201cYou could just ignore him,\u201d Simmon said, sounding surprisingly sober. \u201cJust don\u2019t rise to his baiting and he\u2019ll tire of it soon enough.\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d I said seriously, looking Simmon in the eye. \u201cNo, he won\u2019t.\u201d I liked Simmon, but he was terribly innocent at times. \u201cOnce he thinks I\u2019m weak he\u2019ll be on me twice as thick as the day before. I know his type.\u201d", "\u201cHere he comes,\u201d Wilem observed, looking casually away", "Ambrose saw me before he made it to our side of the room. Our eyes met, and it was obvious that he hadn\u2019t expected to see me there. He said something to one of his ever-present group of bootlickers and they moved off through the crowd in a different direction to claim a table. His eyes moved from me, to Wilem, to Simmon, to my lute, and back to me. Then he turned and walked to the table his friends had claimed. He looked in my direction before he took his seat.", "I found it unnerving that he didn\u2019t smile. He had always smiled at me before, an over-sad pantomime smile, with mockery in his eyes.", "Then I saw something that unnerved me even more. He was carrying a sturdy squared case. \u201cAmbrose plays lyre?\u201d I demanded of the world in general.", "Wilem shrugged. Simmon looked uncomfortable. \u201cI thought you knew,\u201d he said weakly.", "\u201cYou\u2019ve seen him here before?\u201d I asked. Sim nodded. \u201cDid he play?\u201d", "\u201cRecited, actually. Poetry. He recited and kind of plucked at the lyre.\u201d Simmon looked like a rabbit about to run.", "\u201cDoes he have his talent?\u201d I said darkly. I decided then that if Ambrose was a member of this group, I didn\u2019t want anything to do with it.", "\u201cNo,\u201d Simmon squeaked. \u201cHe tried for it, but ...\u201d He trailed off, looking a little wild around the eyes.", "Wilem lay a hand on my arm and made a calming gesture. I took a deep breath, closed my eyes, and tried to relax.", "Slowly, I realized that none of this mattered. At most, it simply raised the stakes for tonight. Ambrose wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything to disrupt my playing. He would be forced to watch and listen. Listen to me playing \u201cThe Lay of Sir Savien Traliard,\u201d because now there was no question as to what I would be performing tonight.", "", "The evening\u2019s entertainment was led by one of the talented musicians from the crowd. He had a lute and showed that he could play it as well as any Edema Ruh. His second song was even better, one that I\u2019d never heard before.", "There was a gap of about ten minutes before another talented musician was called onto the stage to sing. This man had a set of reed pipes and played them better than anyone I had ever heard. He followed by singing a haunting eulogy in a minor key No instrument, just his high clear voice that rose and flowed like the pipes he had played before.", "I was pleased to find the skill of the talented musicians to be everything it was rumored to be. But my anxiety increased a proportionate amount. Excellence is excellence\u2019s only companion. Had I not already decided to play \u201cThe Lay of Sir Savien Traliard\u201d for purely spiteful reasons, these performances would have convinced me.", "There followed another period of five or ten minutes. I realized that Stanchion was deliberately spacing things out to give the audience a chance to move about and make noise between the songs. The man knew his business. I wondered if he had ever been a trouper.", "Then we had our first trial of the night. A bearded man of thirty years or so was brought onto the stage by Stanchion and introduced to the audience. He played flute. Played it well. He played two shorter songs that I knew and a third I didn\u2019t. He played for perhaps twenty minutes in all, only making one small mistake that I could hear.", "After the applause, the flutist remained on stage while Stanchion circulated in the crowd, gathering opinions. A serving boy brought the flutist a glass of water.", "Eventually Stanchion came back onto the stage. The room was quiet as the owner drew close and solemnly shook the man\u2019s hand. The musician\u2019s expression fell, but he managed a sickly smile and a nod to the audience. Stanchion escorted him off the stage and bought something that came in a tall tankard.", "The next to try her talent was a young woman, richly dressed with golden hair. After Stanchion introduced her, she sang an aria in a voice so clear and pure that I forgot my anxiety for a while and was ensnared by her song. For a few blessed moments I forgot myself and could do nothing but listen.", "Too soon it was over, leaving me with a tender feeling in my chest and a vague prickling in my eyes. Simmon sniffled a little and rubbed selfconsciously at his face.", "Then she sang a second song while accompanying herself on a half-harp. I watched her intently, and I will admit that it was not entirely for her musical ability. She had hair like ripe wheat. I could see the clear blue of her eyes from where I sat some thirty feet away. She had smooth arms and small delicate hands that were quick against the strings. And the way she held the harp between her legs made me think of... well, the things that every boy of fifteen thinks about incessantly", "Her voice was as lovely as before, enough to set a heart aching. Unfortunately, her playing could not match it. She struck wrong notes halfway through her second song, faltered, then recovered before she made it to the end of her performance.", "There was a longer pause as Stanchion circulated this time. He milled through the three levels of the Eolian, talking with everyone, young and old, musician and not.", "As I watched, Ambrose caught the eye of the woman on stage and gave her one of his smiles that seem so greasy to me and so charming to women. Then, looking away from her, his gaze wandered to my table and our eyes met. His smile faded, and for a long moment we simply watched each other, expressionless. Neither of us smiled mockingly, or mouthed small insulting nothings to the other. Nevertheless, all our smoldering enmity was renewed in those few minutes. I cannot say with certainty which of us looked away first.", "After nearly fifteen minutes of gathering opinions, Stanchion mounted the stage again. He approached the golden-haired woman and took her hand as he had the previous musician\u2019s. The woman\u2019s face fell in much the same way his had. Stanchion led her from the stage and bought her what I guessed was the consolation tankard.", "Closely on the heels of this failure was another talented musician who played fiddle, excellent as the two before him. Then an older man was brought onto stage by Stanchion as if he were trying for his talent. However the applause that greeted him seemed to imply that he was as popular as any of the talented musicians who had played before him.", "I nudged Simmon. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d I asked, as the grey-bearded man tuned his lyre.", "\u201cThrepe,\u201d Simmon whispered back at me. \u201cCount Threpe, actually. He plays here all the time, has for years. Great patron of the arts. He stopped trying for his pipes years ago. Now he just plays. Everyone loves him.\u201d", "Threpe began to play and I could see immediately why he had never earned his pipes. His voice cracked and wavered as he plucked his lyre. His rhythm varied erratically and it was hard to tell if he struck a wrong note. The song was obviously of his own devising, a rather candid revelation about the personal habits of a local nobleman. But in spite of its lack of classic artistic merit, I found myself laughing along with the rest of the crowd.", "When he was done everyone applauded thunderously, some people pounding on the tables or stamping as well. Stanchion went directly onto the stage and shook the count\u2019s hand, but Threpe didn\u2019t seem disappointed in the least. Stanchion pounded him enthusiastically on the back as he led him down to the bar.", "It was time. I stood and gathered up my lute.", "Wilem clapped my arm and Simmon grinned at me, trying not to look almost sick with friendly worry. I nodded silently to each of them as I walked over to Stanchion\u2019s vacant seat at the end of the bar where it curved toward the stage.", "I fingered the silver talent in my pocket, thick and heavy. Some irrational part of me wanted to clutch it, hoard it for later. But I knew that in a few more days a single talent wouldn\u2019t do me a bit of good. With a set of talent pipes I could support myself playing at local inns. If I was lucky enough to attract the attention of a patron, I could earn enough to square my debt to Devi and pay my tuition as well. It was a gamble I had to take.", "Stanchion came ambling back to his spot at the bar.", "\u201cI\u2019ll go next, sir. If it\u2019s all right with you.\u201d I hoped I didn\u2019t look as nervous as I felt. My grip on the lute case was slippery from my sweating palms.", "He smiled at me and nodded. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a good eye for a crowd, boy This one\u2019s ripe for a sad song. Still planning on doing \u2018Savien\u2019?\u201d", "I nodded.", "He sat down and took a drink. \u201cWell then, let\u2019s just give them a couple minutes to simmer and get their talking over with.\u201d", "I nodded and leaned against the bar. I took the time to fret uselessly about things I had no control over. One of the pegs on my lute was loose and I didn\u2019t have the money to fix it. There had not been any talented women on stage yet. I felt a twinge of unease at the thought of this being the odd night where the only talented musicians at the Eolian were men, or women who didn\u2019t know Aloine\u2019s part.", "It seemed only a short time before Stanchion stood and raised a questioning eyebrow at me. I nodded and picked up my lute case. It suddenly looked terribly shabby to me. Together we walked up the stairs.", "As soon as my foot touched the stage the room hushed to a murmur. At the same time, my nervousness left me, burned away by the attention of the crowd. It has always been that way with me. Offstage I worry and sweat. Onstage I am calm as a windless winter night.", "Stanchion bade everyone consider me as a candidate for my talent. His words had a soothing, ritual feel. When he gestured to me, there was no familiar applause, only an expectant silence. In a flash, I saw myself as the audience must see me. Not finely dressed as the others had been, in fact only one step from being ragged. Young, almost a child. I could feel their curiosity drawing them closer to me.", "I let it build, taking my time as I unclasped my battered secondhand lute case and removed my battered secondhand lute. I felt their attention sharpen at the homely sight of it. I struck a few quiet chords, then touched the pegs, tuning it ever so slightly. I fingered a few more light chords, testing, listened, and nodded to myself.", "The lights shining onto the stage made the rest of the room dim from where I sat. Looking out I saw what seemed to be a thousand eyes. Simmon and Wilem, Stanchion by the bar. Deoch by the door. I felt a vague flutter in my stomach as I saw Ambrose watching me with all the menace of a smoldering coal.", "I looked away from him to see a bearded man in red, Count Threpe, an old couple holding hands, a lovely dark-eyed girl....", "My audience. I smiled at them. The smile drew them closer still, and I sang.", "\u201cStill! Sit! For though you listen long", "Long would you wait without the hope of song", "So sweet as this. As Illien himself set down", "An age ago. Master work of a master\u2019s life", "Of Savien, and Aloine the woman he would take to wife.\u201d", "", "", "I let the wave of whisper pass through the crowd. Those who knew the song made soft exclamation to themselves, while those who didn\u2019t asked their neighbors what the stir was about.", "I raised my hands to the strings and drew their attention back to me. The room stilled, and I began to play.", "The music came easily out of me, my lute like a second voice. I flicked my fingers and the lute made a third voice as well. I sang in the proud powerful tones of Savien Traliard, greatest of the Amyr. The audience moved under the music like grass against the wind. I sang as Sir Savien, and I felt the audience begin to love and fear me.", "I was so used to practicing the song alone that I almost forgot to double the third refrain. But I remembered at the last moment in a flash of cold sweat. This time as I sang it I looked out into the audience, hoping at the end I would hear a voice answering my own.", "I reached the end of the refrain before Aloine\u2019s first stanza. I struck the first chord hard and waited as the sound of it began to fade without drawing a voice from the audience. I looked calmly out to them, waiting. Every second a greater relief vied with a greater disappointment inside me.", "Then a voice drifted onto stage, gentle as a brushing feather, singing....", "\u201cSavien, how could you know", "It was the time for you to come to me?", "Savien, do you remember", "The days we squandered pleasantly?", "How well then have you carried what", "Have tarried in my heart and memory?\u201d", "", "", "She sang as Aloine, I as Savien. On the refrains her voice spun, twinning and mixing with my own. Part of me wanted to search the audience for her, to find the face of the woman I was singing with. I tried, once, but my fingers faltered as I searched for the face that could fit with the cool moonlight voice that answered mine. Distracted, I touched a wrong note and there was a burr in the music.", "A small mistake. I set my teeth and concentrated on my playing. I pushed my curiosity aside and bowed my head to watch my fingers, careful to keep them from slipping on the strings.", "And we sang! Her voice like burning silver, my voice an echoing answer. Savien sang solid, powerful lines, like branches of a rock-old oak, all the while Aloine was like a nightingale, moving in darting circles around the proud limbs of it.", "I was only dimly aware of the audience now, dimly aware of the sweat on my body I was so deeply in the music that I couldn\u2019t have told you where it stopped and my blood began.", "But it did stop. Two verses from the end of the song, the end came. I struck the beginning chord of Savien\u2019s verse and I heard a piercing sound that pulled me out of the music like a fish dragged from deep water.", "A string broke. High on the neck of the lute it snapped and the tension lashed it across the back of my hand, drawing a thin, bright line of blood.", "I stared at it numbly. It should not have broken. None of my strings were worn badly enough to break. But it had, and as the last notes of the music faded into silence I felt the audience begin to stir. They began to rouse themselves from the waking dream that I had woven for them out of strands of song.", "In the silence I felt it all unraveling, the audience waking with the dream unfinished, all my work ruined, wasted. And all the while burning inside me was the song, the song. The song!", "Without knowing what I did, I set my fingers back to the strings and fell deep into myself. Into years before, when my hands had calluses like stones and my music had come as easy as breathing. Back to the time I had played to make the sound of Wind Turning a Leaf on a lute with six strings.", "And I began to play Slowly, then with greater speed as my hands remembered. I gathered the fraying strands of song and wove them carefully back to what they had been a moment earlier.", "It was not perfect. No song as complex as \u201cSir Savien\u201d can be played perfectly on six strings instead of seven. But it was whole, and as I played the audience sighed, stirred, and slowly fell back under the spell that I had made for them.", "I hardly knew they were there, and after a minute I forgot them entirely. My hands danced, then ran, then blurred across the strings as I fought to keep the lute\u2019s two voices singing with my own. Then, even as I watched them, I forgot them, I forgot everything except finishing the song.", "The refrain came, and Aloine sang again. To me she was not a person, or even a voice, she was just a part of the song that was burning out of me.", "And then it was done. Raising my head to look at the room was like breaking the surface of the water for air. I came back into myself, found my hand bleeding and my body covered in sweat. Then the ending of the song struck me like a fist in my chest, as it always does, no matter where or when I listen to it.", "I buried my face in my hands and wept. Not for a broken lute string and the chance of failure. Not for blood shed and a wounded hand. I did not even cry for the boy who had learned to play a lute with six strings in the forest years ago. I cried for Sir Savien and Aloine, for love lost and found and lost again, at cruel fate and man\u2019s folly. And so, for a while, I was lost in grief and knew nothing.", "", "", ""], "CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE": ["CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE", "Flame and Thunder", "\nI held all of my mourning for Savien and Aloine to a few moments. Knowing I was still on display, I gathered myself and straightened in my chair to look out at my audience. My silent audience.", "Music sounds different to the one who plays it. It is the musician\u2019s curse. Even as I sat, the ending I had improvised was fading from my memory. Then came doubt. What if it hadn\u2019t been as whole as it had seemed? What if my ending hadn\u2019t carried the terrible tragedy of the song to anyone but myself? What if my tears seemed to be nothing more than a child\u2019s embarrassing reaction to his own failure?", "Then, waiting, I heard the silence pouring from them. The audience held themselves quiet, tense, and tight, as if the song had burned them worse than flame. Each person held their wounded selves closely, clutching their pain as if it were a precious thing.", "Then there was a murmur of sobs released and sobs escaping. A sigh of tears.

Now that the applause had died, my doubts had come to plague me again. Was one song enough to prove my skill? What if the audience\u2019s reaction had been due to the power of the song, rather than my playing of it? What of my improvised ending? Perhaps the song had only seemed whole to me....", "As I finished removing the broken string I gave it an idle look and all my thoughts fell to a jumble at my feet.", "It wasn\u2019t worn or flawed as I had thought it would be. The broken end was clean, as if it had been cut with a knife or snipped with a pair of scissors.", "For a while I simply stared at it dumbly. My lute had been tampered with? Impossible. It was never out of my sight. Besides, I had checked the strings before I left the University, and again before I had come on stage. Then how?", "I was running the thought in circles in my head when I noticed the crowd quieting. I looked up in time to see Stanchion take the last step onto the stage. I hurriedly got to my feet to face him.", "His expression was pleasant but otherwise unreadable. My stomach tied a knot as he walked toward me, then it fell as he held out his hand the same way he had held it out for the other two musicians who had been found wanting.", "I forced my best smile onto my face and reached to take his hand. I was my father\u2019s son and a trouper. I would take my refusal with the high dignity of the Edema Ruh. The earth would crack and swallow this glittering, self-important place before I would show a trace of despair.", "And somewhere in the watching audience was Ambrose. The earth would have to swallow the Eolian, Imre, and the whole Centhe Sea before I gave him a grain of satisfaction over this.", "So I smiled brightly and took Stanchion\u2019s hand in my own. As I shook it, something hard pressed into my palm. Looking down I saw a glimmer of silver. My talent pipes.", "My expression must have been a delight to watch. I looked back up at Stanchion. His eyes danced and he winked at me.", "I turned and held my pipes aloft for everyone to see. The Eolian roared again. This time it roared a welcome.", "", "\u201cYou\u2019ll have to promise me,\u201d a red-eyed Simmon said seriously, \u201cThat you will never play that song again without warning me first.

I\u2019ve never\u2014\u201d He struggled, wordless for a moment, then bowed his head and began to cry hopelessly into his hands.", "Wilem put a protective arm around Simmon, who leaned unashamedly against his shoulder. \u201cOur Simmon has a tender heart,\u201d he said gently. \u201cI imagine he meant to say that he liked it very much.\u201d", "I noticed that Wilem\u2019s eyes were red around the edges too. I lay a hand on Simmon\u2019s back. \u201cIt hit me hard the first time I heard it too.\u201d I told him honestly. \u201cMy parents performed it during the Midwinter Pageantry when I was nine, and I was a wreck for two hours afterward. They had to cut my part from The Swineherd and the Nightingale because I wasn\u2019t in any shape to act.\u201d", "Simmon nodded and made a gesture that seemed to imply that he was fine but that he didn\u2019t expect to be able to talk any time soon and that I should just carry along with whatever it was I was doing.", "I looked back at Wilem. \u201cI forgot that it hits some people this way,\u201d I said lamely.", "\u201cI recommend scutten,\u201d Wilem said bluntly. \u201cCut-tail, if you insist on the vulgar. But I seem to remember you saying that you would float us home tonight if you got your pipes. Which may be unfortunate, as I happen to be wearing my lead drinking shoes.\u201d", "I heard Stanchion chuckle behind me. \u201cThese must be the two non-castrati friends, eh?\u201d Simmon was surprised enough at being called a non-castrati to collect himself slightly, rubbing his nose on his sleeve.", "\u201cWilem, Simmon, this is Stanchion.\u201d Simmon nodded. Wilem gave a slight, stiff bow. \u201cStanchion, could you help us to the bar? I\u2019ve promised to buy them a drink.\u201d", "\u201cS,\u201d Wilem said. \u201cDrinks.\u201d", "\u201cSorry, drinks,\u201d I stressed the plural. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here if it wasn\u2019t for them.\u201d", "\u201cAh,\u201d Stanchion said with a grin. \u201cPatrons, I understand completely!\u201d", "", "The victory tankard turned out to be the same as the consolation one. It was ready for me when Stanchion finally managed to get us through the throng of people to our new seats at the bar. He even insisted on buying scutten for Simmon and Wilem, saying that patrons have some claim to the spoils of victory as well. I thanked him earnestly from the bottom of my rapidly thinning purse.", "While we were waiting for their drinks to come, I tried to peer curiously into my tankard, and found that doing so while it was sitting on the bar would require me to stand on my stool.", "\u201cMetheglin,\u201d Stanchion informed me. \u201cTry it and you can thank me later. Where I\u2019m from, they say a man will come back from the dead to get a drink of it.\u201d", "I tipped an imaginary hat to him. \u201cAt your service.\u201d", "\u201cYours and your family\u2019s,\u201d he replied politely.", "I took a drink from the tall tankard to give myself a chance to collect my wits, and something wonderful happened in my mouth: cool spring honey, clove, cardamom, cinnamon, pressed grape, burnt apple, sweet pear, and clear well water. That is all I have to say of metheglin. If you haven\u2019t tried it, then I am sorry I cannot describe it properly. If you have, you don\u2019t need me to remind you what it is like.", "I was relieved to see the cut-tail had come in moderately sized glasses, with one for Stanchion too. If my friends had received tankards of the black wine, I would have needed a wheelbarrow to get them back to the other side of the river.", "\u201cTo Savien!\u201d Wilem toasted.", "\u201cHear hear!\u201d Stanchion said, lifting his own glass.", "\u201cSavien ...\u201d Simmon managed, his voice sounding like a stifled sob.", "\u201c... and Aloine,\u201d I said, and maneuvered my great tankard to touch glasses with them.", "Stanchion drank off his Scutten with a nonchalance that made my eyes water. \u201cSo,\u201d he said, \u201cBefore I leave you to the adulation of your peers, I have to ask. Where did you learn to do that? Play missing a string, I mean.\u201d", "I thought for a moment. \u201cDo you want the short or the long of it?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll take the short for now.\u201d", "I smiled. \u201cWell in that case, it\u2019s just something I picked up.\u201d I made a casual gesture as if tossing something away \u201cA remnant of my misspent youth.\u201d", "Stanchion gave me a long look, his expression amused. \u201cI suppose I deserve that. I\u2019ll take the long version next time.\u201d He took a deep breath and looked around the room, his golden earring swung and caught the light. \u201cI\u2019m off to mix the crowd. I\u2019ll keep them from coming at you all at once.\u201d", "I grinned relief. \u201cThank you, sir.\u201d", "He shook his head and made a preemptory motion to someone behind the bar who quickly fetched him his tankard. \u201cEarlier tonight \u2018sir\u2019 was proper and good. But now it\u2019s Stanchion.\u201d He glanced back in my direction, and I smiled and nodded. \u201cAnd I should call you?\u201d", "\u201cKvothe,\u201d I said, \u201cjust Kvothe.\u201d", "\u201cJust Kvothe,\u201d Wilem toasted behind me.", "\u201cAnd Aloine,\u201d Simmon added, and began to cry softly into the crook of his arm.", "", "Count Threpe was one of the first to come to me. He looked shorter up close, and older. But he was bright-eyed and laughing as he talked about my song.", "\u201cThen it broke!\u201d he said, gesturing wildly \u201cAnd all I could think was, Not now! Not before the ending! But I saw the blood on your hand and my stomach knotted up. You looked up at us, then down at the strings, and it got quieter and quieter. Then you put your hands back on the lute and all I could think was, There\u2019s a brave boy. Too brave. He doesn\u2019t know he can\u2019t save the end of a broken song with a broken lute. But you did!\u201d He laughed as if I\u2019d played a joke on the world, and danced a quick jig step.", "Simmon, who had stopped crying and was on his way to becoming well-buttered, laughed along with the count. Wilem didn\u2019t seem to know what to make of the man, and watched him with serious eyes.", "\u201cYou must play at my house some day,\u201d Threpe said, then quickly held up a hand. \u201cWe won\u2019t talk of that now, and I won\u2019t take up any more of your evening.\u201d He smiled. \u201cBut before I go, I need to ask you one last question. How many years did Savien spend with the Amyr?\u201d", "I didn\u2019t have to think about it. \u201cSix. Three years proving himself, three years training.\u201d", "\u201cDoes six strike you as a good number?\u201d", "I didn\u2019t know what he was getting at. \u201cSix isn\u2019t exactly a lucky number,\u201d I hedged. \u201cIf I were looking for a good number I\u2019d have to go up to seven.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cOr down to three.\u201d", "Threpe considered this, tapping his chin. \u201cYou\u2019re right. But six years with the Amyr means he came back to Aloine on the seventh year.\u201d He dug into a pocket and brought out a handful of coins of at least three different currencies. He sorted seven talents out of the mess and pushed them into my surprised hand.", "\u201cMy lord,\u201d I stammered. \u201cI cannot take your money.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the money itself that surprised me, but the amount.", "Threpe looked confused. \u201cWhyever not?\u201d", "I gaped a little bit, and for a rare moment I was at a loss for words.", "Threpe chuckled and closed my hand around the coins. \u201cIt\u2019s not a reward for playing. Well, it is that, but it\u2019s more an incentive for you to keep practicing, keep getting better. It\u2019s for the sake of the music.\u201d", "He shrugged. \u201cYou see, a laurel needs rain to grow. I can\u2019t do much about that. But I can keep that rain off a few musician\u2019s heads, can\u2019t I?\u201d A sly smile wound its way onto his face. \u201cSo God will tend the laurels and keep them wet. And I will tend the players and keep them dry. And wiser minds than mine will decide when to bring the two together.\u201d", "I was silent for a moment. \u201cI think you might be wiser than you give yourself credit for.\u201d", "\u201cWell,\u201d he said, trying not to look pleased. \u201cWell don\u2019t let it get around or people will start expecting great things from me.\u201d He turned and was quickly swallowed by the crowd.", "I slid the seven talents into my pocket and felt a great weight lift from my shoulders. It was like a stay of execution. Perhaps literally, as I had no idea how Devi might have encouraged me to pay my debt. I drew my first carefree breath in two months. It felt good.", "After Threpe left, one of the talented musicians came to offer his compliments. After him it was a Cealdish moneylender who shook my hand and offered to buy me a drink.", "Then there was a minor nobleman, another musician, and a pretty young lady that I thought might be my Aloine until I heard her voice. She was the daughter of a local moneylender, and we talked of small things, briefly, before she moved on. I remembered my manners almost too late and kissed her hand before she left.", "They all blurred together after a while. One by one they came to give me their regards, compliments, handshakes, advice, envy, and admiration. Though Stanchion was true to his word and managed to keep them all from coming at me in a mass, it wasn\u2019t long before I began having trouble telling one from another. The metheglin wasn\u2019t helping matters either.", "I\u2019m not sure how long it was before I thought to look for Ambrose. After scanning the room, I nudged Simmon with an elbow until he looked up from the game he and Wilem were playing with shims. \u201cWhere\u2019s our best friend?\u201d I asked.", "Simmon gave me a blank look and I realized that he was too far into his cups to catch sarcasm. \u201cAmbrose,\u201d I clarified. \u201cWhere\u2019s Ambrose?\u201d", "\u201cScoffered off,\u201d Wilem announced with an edge of bellicosity. \u201cAs soon as you finished playing. Before you\u2019d even got your pipes.\u201d", "\u201cHe knew.

Like someone\u2019d gut-punched him. Linten was giving him an arm to lean on when he left.\u201d", "The symptoms sounded familiar, like binder\u2019s chills. A suspicion began to form. I pictured Ambrose, listening to me glide through the most beautiful song he\u2019d ever heard, and realizing I\u2019m about to win my pipes.", "He wouldn\u2019t do anything obvious, but perhaps he could find a loose thread, or a long splinter from the table. Either one would provide only the most tenuous sympathetic link to my lute string: one percent at best, perhaps only a tenth of that.", "I imagined Ambrose drawing on his own body\u2019s heat, concentrating as the chill slowly worked into his arms and legs. I pictured him, trembling, his breath growing labored, until finally the string breaks ...", "... And I finish the song in spite of him. I grinned at the thought. Pure speculation of course, but something had certainly broken my lute string, and I didn\u2019t doubt for a second that Ambrose would try something of the sort. I focused back in on Simmon.", "\u201c... it up to him and say, No hard feelings about that time in the Crucible when you mixed my salts and I was nearly blind for a day No. No really drink up! Ha!\u201d Simmon laughed, lost in his own vengeful fantasy.", "The flood of well-wishers slowed somewhat: a fellow lutist, the talented piper I\u2019d seen on stage, a local merchant. A heavily perfumed gentleman with long, oiled hair and a Vintic accent clapped me on the back and gave me a purse of money, \u201cfor new strings.\u201d I didn\u2019t like him.

Since you have come to your sense in pushing aside that Yllish fruit drink, will you let me buy you a round of fine dark scutten, drink of the kings of Cealdim?\u201d", "I know a compliment when I hear it, but I was reluctant to accept as I was just beginning to feel clear-headed again.", "Luckily, I was saved from having to make an excuse by Marea coming to pay her respects. She was the lovely, golden-haired harper who had tried for her talent and failed. I thought for a moment that she might be the voice of my Aloine, but after a moment\u2019s listening to her, I realized it couldn\u2019t be.", "She was pretty though. Even prettier than she had seemed on stage, as is not always the case. Talking, I found she was the daughter of one of Imre\u2019s councilmen. Against the tumble of her deep golden hair, the soft blue of her gown was a reflection of the deep blue of her eyes.", "Lovely as she was, I couldn\u2019t give her the concentration she deserved. I itched to be away from the bar to find the voice that had sung Aloine with me. We talked a while, smiled, and parted with kind words and promises to speak again. She disappeared back into the crowd, a wonderful collection of gently moving curves.", "\u201cWhat was that shameful display?\u201d Wilem demanded after she had gone.", "\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.", "\u201cWhat?\u201d he mocked my tone. \u201cCan you even pretend to be that thick? If a girl as fair as that looked at me with one eye the way she looked at you with two ... We\u2019d have a room by now, to say it carefully.\u201d", "\u201cShe was friendly,\u201d I protested. \u201cAnd we were talking.

If you honestly couldn\u2019t tell that she was interested in you, you might want to admit the possibility that you are impossibly thick when it comes to women. You may want to consider the priesthood.\u201d", "\u201cThe both of you are drunk,\u201d I said to cover my flush. \u201cDid you happen to notice from our conversation that she is a councilman\u2019s daughter?\u201d", "\u201cDid you notice,\u201d Wil replied in the same tone, \u201chow she looked at you?\u201d", "I knew I was woefully inexperienced with women, but I didn\u2019t have to admit to it. So I waved his comment away and got down off my stool. \u201cSomehow I doubt that a quick romp behind the bar was what she had in mind.\u201d I took a drink of water and straightened my cloak. \u201cNow, I must go find my Aloine and offer her my earnest thanks. How do I look?\u201d", "\u201cWhat does it matter?\u201d Wilem asked.", "Simmon touched Wilem\u2019s elbow. \u201cDon\u2019t you see?

Some foolish, romantic part of me thought I would know her when I saw her. If she were half as radiant as her voice, she would shine like a candle in a dark room.", "But as I thought these things, the wiser part of me was whispering in my other ear. Do not hope, it said. Do not dare hold hope that any woman could burn as brightly as the voice that sang the part of Aloine. And while this voice was not comforting, I knew it to be wise. I had learned to listen to it on the streets of Tarbean, where it had kept me alive.", "I wandered through the first level of the Eolian, searching without knowing who I was looking for. Occasionally people would smile or wave. After five minutes I had seen all the faces there were to see and moved to the second level.", "This was actually a converted balcony, but instead of tiers of seats, there were rising ranks of tables that looked onto the lower level. As I wended my way through the tables looking for my Aloine, my wiser half kept murmuring in my ear. Do not hope. All you will earn is disappointment. She will not be as beautiful as you imagine, and then you will despair.", "As I finished searching the second level a new fear began to rise in me. She might have left while I was sitting at the bar, drinking in metheglin and praise. I should have gone to her straightaway, fallen to one knee, and thanked her with my whole heart. What if she was gone? What if no one knew who she was or where she had gone? A nervousness settled into the pit of my stomach as I took the stairs to the highest level of the Eolian.", "Now look what your hope has gotten you, the voice said. She is gone and all you have is a bright, foolish imagining to torment yourself with.", "The last level was the smallest of the three, hardly more than a thin crescent that hugged three walls, high above the stage. Here, the tables and benches were more widely spaced and sparsely populated. I noticed that the inhabitants of this level were mostly couples and I felt something of a voyeur as I passed from table to table.", "Trying to appear casual, I looked at the faces of those who sat talking and drinking. I grew more nervous the closer I came to the last table. It was impossible for me to do so casually, as it was in a corner. The couple sitting there, one light haired and one dark, had their backs to me.", "As I approached, the light-haired one laughed and I caught a glimpse of a proud, fine-featured face. A man. I turned my attention to the woman with the long dark hair. My last hope. I knew she would be my Aloine.", "Coming round the corner of the table I saw her face. Or rather, his face. They were both men. My Aloine had left. I had lost her, and with that knowledge I felt as if my heart had been tipped from its resting place in my chest to topple and fall somewhere deep inside me near my feet.", "They looked up, and the fair-haired one smiled at me. \u201cLook Thria, young six-string has come to offer us his respects.\u201d He eyed me up and down. \u201cYou\u2019re a fair one. Would you like to join us for a drink?\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d I murmured, embarrassed. \u201cI was just looking for someone.\u201d", "\u201cWell you found someone,\u201d he said easily, touching my arm. \u201cMy name is Fallon and this is Thria. Come and have a drink. I promise to keep Thria here from trying to take you home. He has a terrible weakness for musicians.\u201d He smiled charmingly at me.", "I murmured an excuse and took my leave, too distraught to worry whether or not I had made an ass of myself.", "As I made my desolate way back to the stairs, my wise self took the opportunity to berate me. That is what comes of hope, it said. No good. Still, you are better having missed her. She could never have been equal to her voice. That voice, fair and terrible as burning silver, like moonlight on river stones, like a feather against your lips.", "I headed to the stairs, eyes on the floor lest anyone try to catch me in a conversation.", "Then I heard a voice, a voice like burning silver, like a kiss against my ears.

Did you talk to her?\u201d", "\u201cOf course I talked to her. There would be no story if I hadn\u2019t. Telling that part is easy. But first I must describe her. I\u2019m not sure how to do it.\u201d", "Bast fidgeted.", "Kvothe laughed, a fond expression wiping the irritation from his face. \u201cSo is describing a beautiful woman as easy as looking at one for you?\u201d", "Bast looked down and blushed, and Kvothe laid a gentle hand on his arm, smiling. \u201cMy trouble, Bast, is that she is very important. Important to the story. I cannot think of how to describe her without falling short of the mark.\u201d", "\u201cI ... I think I understand, Reshi,\u201d Bast said in conciliatory tones. \u201cI\u2019ve seen her too. Once.\u201d", "Kvothe sat back in his chair, surprised. \u201cYou have, haven\u2019t you? I\u2019d forgotten.\u201d He pressed his hands to his lips. \u201cHow would you describe her then?\u201d", "Bast brightened at the opportunity. Straightening up in his chair he looked thoughtful for a moment then said. \u201cShe had perfect ears.\u201d He made a delicate gesture with his hands. \u201cPerfect little ears, like they were carved out of... something.\u201d", "Chronicler laughed, then looked slightly taken aback, as if he\u2019d surprised himself. \u201cHer ears?\u201d he asked as if he couldn\u2019t be sure if he had heard correctly.", "\u201cYou know how hard it is to find a pretty girl with the right sort of ears,\u201d Bast said matter-of-factly", "Chronicler laughed again, seeming to find it easier the second time. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t.\u201d", "Bast gave the story collector a deeply pitying look. \u201cWell then, you\u2019ll just have to take my word for it. They were exceptionally fine.\u201d", "\u201cI think you\u2019ve struck that chord well enough, Bast,\u201d Kvothe said, amused. He paused for a moment, and when he spoke again it was slowly, his eyes far away. \u201cThe trouble is, she is unlike anyone I have ever known. There was something intangible about her. Something compelling, like heat from a fire. She had a grace, a spark\u2014\u201d", "\u201cShe had a crooked nose, Reshi,\u201d Bast said, interrupting his master\u2019s reverie.", "Kvothe looked at him, a line of irritation creasing his forehead. \u201cWhat?\u201d", "Bast held his hands up defensively. \u201cIt\u2019s just something I noticed, Reshi. All the women in your story are beautiful. I can\u2019t gainsay you as a whole, as I\u2019ve never seen any of them. But this one I did see. Her nose was a little crooked. And if we\u2019re being honest here, her face was a little narrow for my taste. She wasn\u2019t a perfect beauty by any means, Reshi. I should know. I\u2019ve made some study of these things.\u201d", "Kvothe stared at his student for a long moment, his expression solemn. \u201cWe are more than the parts that form us, Bast,\u201d he said with a hint of reproach.", "\u201cI\u2019m not saying she wasn\u2019t lovely, Reshi,\u201d Bast said quickly. \u201cShe smiled at me.

But then again, I\u2019ve met her.\u201d Kvothe looked at Chronicler. \u201cThe trouble comes from comparison, you see. If I say \u2018she was dark haired,\u2019 you might think, \u2018I\u2019ve known dark-haired women, some of them lovely\u2019 But you would be far off the mark, because that woman would not really have anything in common with her. That other woman wouldn\u2019t have her quick wit, her easy charm. She was unlike anyone I have ever met....\u201d", "Kvothe trailed off, looking down at folded hands. He was quiet for such a long moment that Bast began to fidget, looking around anxiously.", "\u201cThere\u2019s no sense worrying, I suppose,\u201d Kvothe said at last, looking up and motioning to Chronicler. \u201cIf I ruin this as well, it will be a small thing as far as the world is concerned.\u201d", "Chronicler picked up his pen, and Kvothe began to speak before he had the chance to dip it. \u201cHer eyes were dark.

Like a teardrop.\u201d", "Kvothe stopped suddenly, as if he had run himself out of words. The silence was so sudden and deep that Chronicler glanced briefly up from his page, something he had not done before. But even as Chronicler looked up, another flood of words burst out of Kvothe.", "\u201cHer easy smile could stop a man\u2019s heart. Her lips were red. Not the garish painted red so many women believe makes them desirable. Her lips were always red, morning and night. As if minutes before you saw her, she had been eating sweet berries, or drinking heart\u2019s blood.", "\u201cNo matter where she stood, she was in the center of the room.\u201d Kvothe frowned. \u201cDo not misunderstand. She was not loud, or vain. We stare at a fire because it flickers, because it glows. The light is what catches our eyes, but what makes a man lean close to a fire has nothing to do with its bright shape. What draws you to a fire is the warmth you feel when you come near. The same was true of Denna.\u201d", "As Kvothe spoke, his expression twisted, as if each word he spoke rankled him more and more. And while the words were clear, they matched his expression, as if each one was rasped with a rough file before it left his mouth.", "\u201cShe ...\u201d Kvothe\u2019s head was bowed so low he seemed to be speaking to his hands laying in his lap. \u201cWhat am I doing?\u201d He said faintly, as if his mouth was full of grey ash. \u201cWhat good can come of this? How can I make any sense of her for you when I have never understood the least piece of her myself?\u201d", "Chronicler had written most of this out before he realized that Kvothe had probably not intended him to.

She turned and began to walk in my direction without lifting her eyes from the floor, without seeing me.", "The months had changed her. Where before she had been pretty, now she was lovely as well. Perhaps that difference was only that she wasn\u2019t wearing the road clothes I had met her in, but a long dress instead. But it was Denna without a doubt.

In the space of half a step, she transformed her delighted headlong run into a demure greeting at arm\u2019s length. It was gracefully done, but even so, she had to reach out a hand and steady herself against my chest, lest she stumble into me due to her sudden stop.", "She smiled at me then.

I reached out smoothly and clasped Denna\u2019s outstretched hand in my own, as if she\u2019d offered it to me. Then I took a half step backward and made a genteel three-quarter bow. At the same time my free hand caught hold of the edge of my cloak and tucked it behind my back. It was a flattering bow, courtly without being ridiculously formal, and safe for a public setting such as this.", "What next? A kiss on the hand was traditional, but what sort of kiss was appropriate? In Atur you merely nod over the hand.

Then she looked up at me, her expression unreadable. \u201cI think you might be a wonderful person,\u201d she said.", "I drew a breath, but Denna spoke first. \u201cHowever,\u201d she said, \u201cthis is too great a thanks. More payment than is appropriate for any help I\u2019ve given you.

It\u2019s incredible. There\u2019s more careful engineering in that swan neck than in any three cathedrals.\u201d I watched as the old man tucked his beard out of the way and adjusted himself in his seat. \u201cI just hope he tuned it before he went onstage,\u201d I added softly. \u201cOtherwise we\u2019ll be waiting an hour while he fiddles with his pegs.

Then he began to play.", "I am shamed to admit it, but I remember nothing of the song. Despite the fact that I had never seen a court lute, let alone heard one, my mind was too awhirl with thoughts of Denna to absorb much else. As we leaned on the railing side by side, I snuck glances of her out of the corner of my eye.", "She hadn\u2019t called me by name, or mentioned our meeting before in Roent\u2019s caravan. That meant she didn\u2019t remember me. Not too surprising, I suppose, that she would forget a ragged boy she\u2019d only known for a few days on the road. Still, it stung a bit, as I\u2019d had fond thoughts of her for months. Still, there was no way to bring it up now without seeming foolish. Better to make a fresh start and hope I was more memorable the second time around.", "The song was over before I realized it, and I clapped enthusiastically to make up for my inattention.", "\u201cI thought you\u2019d made a mistake when you doubled your chorus earlier,\u201d Denna said to me as the applause died down. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe you really wanted a stranger to join in. I haven\u2019t seen that done anywhere except around campfires at night.\u201d", "I shrugged. \u201cEveryone kept telling me this is where the best musicians played.\u201d I made a sweeping gesture with one hand toward her. \u201cI trusted someone would know the part.\u201d", "She arched an eyebrow. \u201cIt was a near thing,\u201d she said. \u201cI waited for someone else to jump in instead. I was a little anxious to step in myself.\u201d", "I gave her a puzzled look. \u201cWhy? You have a lovely voice.\u201d", "She gave a sheepish grimace. \u201cI\u2019d only heard the song twice before this.

Doubly surprised that he would have the bad grace to interrupt me when I was in a private conversation with a young woman.", "\u201cHere we all are.\u201d Sovoy smiled at me as he walked over and put his arm casually around Denna\u2019s waist.

Denna looked over her shoulder at me and gave a sort of a shrug with her eyebrows. I hadn\u2019t the slightest idea what the expression meant.", "Sovoy waved me over to join them and pulled over an unoccupied chair so I would have a place to sit. \u201cI couldn\u2019t quite believe it was you down there,\u201d he said to me. \u201cI thought I recognized your voice, but ...\u201d He gestured, indicating the highest level of the Eolian. \u201cWhile the third circle provides a comfortable privacy for young lovers, its view of the stage leaves a little to be desired. I didn\u2019t know you played.\u201d He settled a long arm across Denna\u2019s shoulders and smiled his charming blue-eyed smile.", "\u201cOff and on,\u201d I said flippantly as I sat down.", "\u201cLucky for you I picked the Eolian for our entertainment tonight,\u201d Sovoy said. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019d have had nothing but echoes and crickets to accompany you.\u201d", "\u201cThen I\u2019m in your debt,\u201d I said to him, with a deferential nod.", "\u201cMake it up to me by taking Simmon as a partner next time we play corners,\u201d he said. \u201cThat way you\u2019re the one to eat the forfeit when the giddy little bastard calls the tall card with nothing but a pair.\u201d", "\u201cDone,\u201d I said. \u201cThough it pains me.\u201d I turned to Denna. \u201cWhat of you? I owe you a great favor\u2014how can I repay it? Ask anything and it is yours, should it be within my skill.\u201d", "\u201cAnything within your skill,\u201d she repeated playfully. \u201cWhat can you do then, besides play so well that Tehlu and his angels would weep to hear?\u201d", "\u201cI imagine I could do anything,\u201d I said easily. \u201cIf you would ask it of me.\u201d", "She laughed.", "\u201cThat\u2019s a dangerous thing to say to a woman,\u201d Sovoy said. \u201cEspecially this one.

Would you bring me one?\u201d", "\u201cI would,\u201d I said, and was surprised to find that it was the truth.", "She seemed to consider it, then shook her head playfully. \u201cI couldn\u2019t send you journeying so far away. I\u2019ll have to save my favor for another day\u201d", "I sighed. \u201cSo I am left in your debt.\u201d", "\u201cOh no!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cAnother weight upon my Savien\u2019s heart....\u201d", "\u201cThe reason my heart is so heavy is that I fear I might never know your name.

I might like that if I didn\u2019t think you were a liar.\u201d", "\u201cA liar?\u201d I said indignantly. \u201cMy first thought in seeing you was \u2018Felurian! What have I done?

Sovoy mentioned you were keeping pace with him in the University. That means you meddle with dark forces better left alone. If I give you my name you would have a terrible power over me.\u201d Her mouth was serious, but her smile showed itself around the corners of her eyes, in the tilt of her head.", "\u201cThat is very true,\u201d I said with equal seriousness. \u201cBut I will make you a bargain. I\u2019ll give you my name in exchange. Then I will be in your power as well.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019d sell me my own shirt,\u201d she said. \u201cSovoy knows your name.

From the circles under his eyes and his anxious expression, I didn\u2019t think he was eager to go through testing that soon. \u201cWill you take five jots?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019d like to get a whole talent....\u201d", "He nodded, flipping his own tile over between his fingers. It was a fair price. No one wanted to go through admissions on the first day. \u201cMaybe later. I\u2019ll look around a little first.\u201d", "As I watched him leave, I marveled at the difference a single day could make. Yesterday five jots would have seemed like all the money in the world. But today my purse was heavy....", "I was lost in vague musings about how much money I had actually earned last night when I saw Wilem and Simmon approaching. Wil looked a little pale under his dark Cealdish complexion. I guessed he was feeling the aftereffects of our night\u2019s carousing too.", "Sim, on the other hand, was bright and sunny as ever. \u201cGuess who drew slots this afternoon?\u201d He nodded over my shoulder. \u201cAmbrose and several of his friends. It\u2019s enough to make me believe in a just universe.\u201d", "Turning to search the crowd, I heard Ambrose\u2019s voice before I saw him. \u201c... from the same bag, that means they did a piss-poor job mixing. They should restart this whole mismanaged sham and ...\u201d", "Ambrose was walking with several well-dressed friends, their eyes sweeping over the crowd, looking for raised hands. Ambrose was a dozen feet away before he finally looked down and realized the hand he was heading toward was mine.", "He stopped short, scowling, then gave a sudden barking laugh. \u201cYou poor boy, all the time in the world and no way to spend it. Hasn\u2019t Lorren let you back in yet?\u201d", "\u201cHammer and horn,\u201d Wil said wearily behind me.", "Ambrose smiled at me. \u201cTell you what. I\u2019ll give you ha\u2019penny and one of my old shirts for your slot. That way, you\u2019ll have something to wear when you\u2019re washing that one in the river.\u201d A few of his friends chuckled behind him, looking me up and down.", "I kept my expression nonchalant, not wanting to give him any satisfaction. Truth was, I was all too aware of the fact that I only owned two shirts, and after two terms of constant wear they were getting shabby Shabbier. What\u2019s more, I did wash them in the river, as I\u2019d never had money to spare for laundry.", "\u201cI\u2019ll pass,\u201d I said lightly. \u201cYour shirttails are a little richly dyed for my taste.\u201d I tugged at the front of my own shirt to make my point clear. A few nearby students laughed.", "\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d I heard Sim say quietly to Wil.", "\u201cHe\u2019s implying Ambrose has the ...\u201d Wil paused. \u201cThe Edamete tass, \u0430 disease you get from whores. There is a discharge\u2014\u201d", "\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Sim said quickly. \u201cI get it. Ick. Ambrose is wearing green too.\u201d", "Meanwhile, Ambrose forced himself to chuckle along with the crowd at my joke. \u201cI suppose I deserve that,\u201d he said. \u201cVery well, pennies for the poor.\u201d He brought out his purse and shook it. \u201cHow much do you want?\u201d", "\u201cFive talents,\u201d I said.", "He stared at me, frozen in the act of opening his purse. It was an outrageous price. A few of the spectators nudged each other with their elbows, obviously hoping I\u2019d somehow swindle Ambrose into paying several times what my slot was actually worth.", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I asked. \u201cDo you need that converted?\u201d It was a well-known fact that Ambrose had botched the arithmetic portion of his admissions last term.", "\u201cFive is ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d be lucky to get one this late in the day\u201d", "I forced a careless shrug. \u201cI\u2019d settle for four.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019ll settle for one,\u201d Ambrose insisted. \u201cI\u2019m not an idiot.\u201d", "I took a deep breath, let it out again, resigned. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose I could get you to go as high as ... one and four?\u201d I asked, disgusted by how plaintive my voice sounded.", "Ambrose smiled like a shark. \u201cI tell you what,\u201d he said magnanimously. \u201cI\u2019ll give you one and three. I\u2019m not above a little charity now and again.\u201d", "\u201cThank you sir,\u201d I said meekly. \u201cIt\u2019s much appreciated.\u201d I could sense the crowd\u2019s disappointment as I rolled over like a dog for Ambrose\u2019s money.", "\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Ambrose said smugly. \u201cAlways a pleasure to help out the needy.\u201d", "\u201cIn Vintish coin, that\u2019ll be two nobles, six bits, two pennies, and four shims.\u201d", "\u201cI can do my own conversion,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI\u2019ve traveled the world with my father\u2019s retinue since I was a boy. I know how money spends.\u201d", "\u201cOf course you do.\u201d I ducked my head. \u201cSilly of me.\u201d I looked up curiously \u201cYou\u2019ve been to Modeg then?\u201d", "\u201cOf course,\u201d he said absentmindedly as he proceeded to dig through his purse, pulling out an assortment of coins. \u201cI\u2019ve actually been to high court in Cershaen. Twice.\u201d", "\u201cIs it true that the Modegan nobility regard haggling as a contemptible activity for those of any highborn station?\u201d I asked innocently. \u201cI heard that they consider it a sure sign that the person is either possessed of low blood or fallen on truly desperate times....\u201d", "Ambrose looked up at me, frozen halfway through the act of digging coins out of his purse. His eyes narrowed.", "\u201cBecause if that\u2019s true, it\u2019s terribly kind of you to come down to my level just for the fun of a little bargain.\u201d I grinned at him. \u201cWe Ruh love to dicker.\u201d There was a murmur of laughter from the crowd around us. It had grown to several dozen people at this point.", "\u201cThat\u2019s not it at all,\u201d Ambrose said.", "My face became a mask of concern. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, m\u2019lord. I had no idea you\u2019d come on hard times....\u201d I took several steps toward him, holding out my admissions tile. \u201cHere, you can have it for just ha\u2019penny. I\u2019m not above a little charity myself.\u201d I stood directly in front of him, holding out the tile. \u201cPlease, I insist, it\u2019s always a pleasure to help the needy.\u201d", "Ambrose glared furiously. \u201cKeep it and choke,\u201d he hissed at me in a low voice. \u201cAnd remember this when you\u2019re eating beans and washing in the river. I\u2019ll still be here the day you leave with nothing but your hands in your pockets.\u201d He turned and left, the very picture of affronted dignity.", "There was a smattering of applause from the surrounding crowd. I took flourishing bows in all directions.", "\u201cHow would you score that one?\u201d Wil asked Sim.", "\u201cTwo for Ambrose. Three for Kvothe.\u201d Sim looked at me. \u201cNot your best work, really.\u201d", "\u201cI didn\u2019t get much sleep last night,\u201d I admitted.", "\u201cEvery time you do this it makes the eventual payback that much worse,\u201d Wil said.", "\u201cWe can\u2019t do anything but snap at each other,\u201d I said. \u201cThe masters made sure of that. Anything too extreme would get us expelled for Conduct Unbecoming a Member of the Arcanum. Why do you think I haven\u2019t made his life a hell?\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re lazy?\u201d Wil suggested.", "\u201cLaziness is one of my best characteristics,\u201d I said easily. \u201cIf I weren\u2019t lazy, I might go through the work of translating Edamete tass and grow terribly offended when I discover it means \u2018the Edema Drip.\u2019 \u201d I raised my hand again, thumb and middle finger extended. \u201cInstead I\u2019ll assume it translates directly into the name of the disease: \u2018nemserria,\u2019 thus preventing any unnecessary strain on our friendship.\u201d", "I eventually sold my slot to a desperate Re\u2019lar from the Fishery named Jaxim. I drove a hard bargain, trading him my slot for six jots and a favor to be named later.", "Admissions went about as well as could be expected, considering I couldn\u2019t study. Hemme was still carrying his grudge. Lorren was cool. Elodin had his head down on the table and seemed to be asleep. My tuition was a full six talents, which put me in an interesting situation....", "", "The long road to Imre was mostly deserted. The sun brushed through the trees and the wind carried just a hint of the cool that fall would soon be bringing. I headed to the Eolian first to retrieve my lute. Stanchion had insisted that I leave it there last night, lest I break it on my long, inebriated walk home.", "As I approached the Eolian, I saw Deoch lounging against the doorpost, walking a coin across the back knuckles of his hand. He smiled when he saw me. \u201cHo there! Thought you and your friends would end up in the river by the way you were weaving when you left last night.\u201d", "\u201cWe were swaying in different directions,\u201d I explained. \u201cSo it balanced out.\u201d", "Deoch laughed. \u201cWe\u2019ve got your lady inside.\u201d", "I fought down a flush and wondered how he had known I was hoping to find Denna here. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would call her my lady exactly.\u201d Sovoy was my friend, after all.", "He shrugged. \u201cWhatever you call her, Stanchion\u2019s got her behind the bar. I\u2019d go grab her before he gets overly familiar and starts practicing his fingering.\u201d", "I felt a flash of rage and barely managed to swallow a mouthful of hot words. My lute. He was talking about my lute. I ducked inside quickly, guessing the less Deoch saw of my expression the better it would be.", "I wandered through the three levels of the Eolian, but Denna was nowhere to be found. I did run into Count Threpe though, who enthusiastically invited me to have a seat.", "\u201cI don\u2019t suppose I might persuade you to pay me a visit at my house sometime?\u201d Threpe asked bashfully. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of having a little dinner, and I know a few people who would love to meet you.\u201d He winked. \u201cWord about your performance is already getting around.\u201d", "I felt a twinge of anxiety, but I knew rubbing elbows with the nobility was something of a necessary evil. \u201cI\u2019d be honored to, my lord.\u201d", "Threpe grimaced. \u201cDoes it have to be my lord?\u201d", "Diplomacy is a large part of being a trouper, and a large portion of diplomacy is adherence to title and rank. \u201cEtiquette, my lord,\u201d I said regretfully.", "\u201cPiss on etiquette,\u201d Threpe said petulantly. \u201cEtiquette is a set of rules people use so they can be rude to each other in public. I was born Dennais first, Threpe second, and count last of all.\u201d He looked imploringly up at me. \u201cDenn for short?\u201d", "I hesitated.", "\u201cHere at least,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cIt makes me feel like a weed in a flowerbed when someone starts \u2018lording\u2019 me here.\u201d", "I relaxed. \u201cIf it makes you happy, Denn.\u201d", "He flushed as if I\u2019d flattered him. \u201cTell me a bit about yourself, then. Where are you lodging?\u201d", "\u201cOn the other side of the river,\u201d I said evasively. The bunks in Mews were not exactly glamorous. When Threpe gave me a puzzled look, I continued. \u201cI attend the University.\u201d", "\u201cThe University?\u201d he asked, clearly puzzled. \u201cAre they teaching music now?\u201d", "I almost laughed at the thought. \u201cNo no. I\u2019m in the Arcanum.\u201d", "I immediately regretted my words.

You know, grammar, mathematics....\u201d I picked two of the more innocent fields of study I could think of, and he seemed to relax a bit.", "\u201cI guess I\u2019d just thought that you were ...\u201d he trailed off and shook himself. \u201cWhy are you studying there?\u201d", "The question caught me off guard. \u201cI ... I\u2019ve always wanted to. There\u2019s so much to learn.\u201d", "\u201cBut you don\u2019t need any of that.

Damn. Damn.\u201d", "He recovered his composure a little and looked up at me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just that...\u201d He made a frustrated gesture and sighed. \u201cHave you ever heard the saying: \u2018One wife, you\u2019re happy, two and you\u2019re tired\u2014\u201d", "I nodded. \u201c\u2014three and they\u2019ll hate each other\u2014\u201d", "\u201c\u2014four and they\u2019ll hate you,\u201d Threpe finished. \u201cWell the same thing is doubly true for patrons and their musicians. I just picked up my third, a struggling flutist.\u201d He sighed and shook his head. \u201cThey bicker like cats in a bag, worried they\u2019re not getting enough attention. If only I\u2019d known you were coming along, I would have waited.\u201d", "\u201cYou flatter me, Denn.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m kicking myself is what I\u2019m doing,\u201d he sighed and looked guilty. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair. Sephran\u2019s good at what he does. They\u2019re all good musicians, and overprotective of me, just like real wives.\u201d He gave me an apologetic look. \u201cIf I try to bring you in, there\u2019ll be hell to pay. I\u2019ve already had to lie about that little gift I gave you last night.\u201d", "\u201cSo I\u2019m your mistress then?\u201d I grinned.", "Threpe chuckled. \u201cLet\u2019s not carry the analogy too far. I\u2019ll be your matchmaker instead. I\u2019ll help you toward a proper patron. I know everyone with blood or money for fifty miles, so it shouldn\u2019t be that hard.\u201d", "\u201cThat would be a great help,\u201d I said earnestly. \u201cThe social circles on this side of the river are a mystery to me.\u201d A thought occurred to me. \u201cSpeaking of which, I met a young lady last night, and didn\u2019t find out much about her. If you\u2019re familiar with the town ...\u201d I trailed off hopefully.", "He gave me a knowing look. \u201cAhhh, I see.\u201d", "\u201cNo no no,\u201d I protested. \u201cShe\u2019s the girl that sang along with me. My Aloine. I was just hoping to find her to pay my respects.\u201d", "Threpe looked as if he didn\u2019t believe me, but wasn\u2019t going to make an issue of it. \u201cFair enough, what\u2019s her name?\u201d", "\u201cDianne.\u201d Threpe seemed to be waiting for more. \u201cThat\u2019s all I know.\u201d", "Threpe snorted. \u201cWhat did she look like? Sing it if you have to.\u201d", "I felt the beginning of a flush on my cheeks. \u201cShe had dark hair to about here,\u201d I gestured a little lower than my shoulder with one hand. \u201cYoung, fair skin.\u201d Threpe watched me expectantly. \u201cPretty.\u201d", "\u201cI see,\u201d Threpe mused, rubbing his lips. \u201cDid she have her talent pipes?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know.

One or two asked about you.\u201d He winked at me. \u201cWho caught your eye?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not like that,\u201d I protested. \u201cShe was the one who sang my harmony last night. She had a lovely voice and I was hoping to find her so we could do a little singing.\u201d", "\u201cI think I know the tune you\u2019re talking about.\u201d He gave me a broad, knowing smile.", "I felt myself blushing furiously and began to protest again.", "\u201cOh settle down, I\u2019ll keep this one between my tongue and teeth. I\u2019ll even keep from telling Stanchion, which is as good as telling the whole town. He gossips like a schoolgirl when he\u2019s had a cup.\u201d He looked at me expectantly.", "\u201cShe was slender with deep, coffee-colored eyes,\u201d I said before I thought about how it sounded. I hurried on before either Threpe or Deoch could make a joke. \u201cHer name was Dianne.\u201d", "\u201cAhhh.\u201d Deoch nodded slowly to himself, his smile going a little wry. \u201cI guess I should have known.\u201d", "\u201cDoes she live here?\u201d Threpe asked. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I know her.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019d remember,\u201d Deoch said. \u201cBut no, I don\u2019t think she lives in town.

Careful boy, that one will steal your heart. Men fall for her like wheat before a sickle blade.\u201d", "I shrugged as if such things couldn\u2019t be further from my mind, and was glad when Threpe turned the topic to a piece of gossip about one of the local councilmen. I chuckled at their bickering until my drink was done, then made my farewells and took my leave of them.", "", "Half an hour later I stood on the stairway outside Devi\u2019s door, trying to ignore the rancid smell of the butcher\u2019s shop below. I counted my money for the third time and thought about my options. I could pay off my entire debt and still afford my tuition, but it would leave me penniless. I had other debts to settle as well, and as much as I wanted to be out from under Devi\u2019s thumb, I didn\u2019t relish starting the semester without a bit of coin in my pocket. The door opened suddenly, startling me. Devi\u2019s face peered out suspiciously through a narrow crack, then brightened with a smile when she recognized me. \u201cWhat are you lurking for?\u201d she asked. \u201cGentlemen knock, as a rule.\u201d She opened the door wide to let me in.", "\u201cJust weighing my options,\u201d I said as she bolted the door behind me.

You\u2019d be surprised how few visitors I get.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s probably your location more than your company,\u201d I said.", "She wrinkled her nose. \u201cI know. I settled here at first because it was cheap.

I was partway through reading that when I was kicked out.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s the latest edition,\u201d she said proudly \u201cThere\u2019s new engravings and a section on the Faen-Moite.\u201d", "I ran my fingers down the book\u2019s spine, then stepped back. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice collection.\u201d", "\u201cWell,\u201d she said teasingly \u201cIf you promise to keep your hands clean, you could come over and do some reading now and again. If you bring your lute and play for me, I might even let you borrow a book or two, so long as you bring them back in a timely fashion.\u201d She gave me a winsome smile. \u201cWe exiles should stick together.\u201d", "I spent the long walk back to the University wondering if Devi was being flirtatious or friendly. At the end of the three miles, I hadn\u2019t reached anything resembling a decision. I mention this to make something clear. I was clever, a burgeoning hero with an Alar like a bar of Ramston steel.

Then he made a shooing motion with the hand that held his unfinished lamp. \u201cGo. Do not be late for work or I will keep you polishing bottles and grinding ore for another term.\u201d", "As I left, I thought about what Kilvin had said.

The innkeeper was a bald, portly fellow named Caverin. I showed him my talent pipes and bargained for a pleasant fifteen minutes.", "The end result was that in exchange for playing three evenings a span I received free room and board. The Four\u2019s kitchens were remarkable, and my room was actually a small suite: bedroom, dressing room, and sitting room. A huge step up from my narrow bunk in the Mews.", "But best of all, I would earn two silver talents every month. An almost ridiculous sum of money to someone who had been poor for as long as I had.

But the truth behind the stories was that I was hoping to find Denna.", "But my diligence gained me nothing. She seemed to have vanished from the town completely. I asked a few people who I could trust not to make gossip of it, but none of them knew more than Deoch. I briefly entertained the thought of asking Sovoy about her, but discarded it as a bad idea.", "After my sixth fruitless trip to Imre I decided to abandon my search.

Again.", "", "It was during one of my Denna-less trips to the Eolian that I received some troubling news from Count Threpe. Apparently, Ambrose, firstborn son of the wealthy and influential Baron Jakis, had been busy as a bee in the social circles of Imre. He had spread rumors, made threats, and generally turned the nobility against me. While he couldn\u2019t keep me from gaining the respect of my fellow musicians, apparently he could keep me from gaining a wealthy patron. It was my first glimpse of the trouble Ambrose could make for a person like me.", "Threpe was apologetic and morose, while I seethed with irritation. Together we proceeded to drink an unwise amount of wine and grouse about Ambrose Jakis. Eventually Threpe was called up onto the stage where he sang a scathing little ditty of his own design, satirizing one of Tarbean\u2019s council-men. It was met with great laughter and applause.", "From there it was a short step for us to begin composing a song about Ambrose. Threpe was an inveterate gossipmonger with a knack for tasteless innuendo, and I have always had a gift for a catchy tune. It took us under an hour to compose our masterwork, which we lovingly titled \u201cJackass, Jackass.\u201d", "On the surface, it was a ribald little tune about a donkey who wanted to be an arcanist. Our extraordinarily clever pun on Ambrose\u2019s surname was as close as we came to mentioning him. But anyone with half a wit could tell who the shoe was meant to fit.", "It was late when Threpe and I took the stage, and we weren\u2019t the only ones worse for drink. There was thunderous laughter and applause from the majority of the audience, who called for an encore. We gave it to them again, and everyone came in singing on the chorus.", "The key to the song\u2019s success was its simplicity. You could whistle or hum it. Anyone with three fingers could play it, and if you had one ear and a bucket you could carry the tune. It was catchy, and vulgar, and mean-spirited. It spread through the University like a fire in a field.", "", "I tugged open the outer doors of the Archives and stepped into the entry hall, my eyes adjusting to the red tint of the sympathy lamps. The air was dry and cool, rich with the smell of dust, leather, and old ink. I took a breath the way a starving man might outside a bakery.", "Wilem was tending the desk. I knew he\u2019d be working.

It might be a while\u2014\u201d", "A tall, lean Cealdish man opened the door behind the entry desk. Unlike most Cealdish men he was clean-shaven and wore his hair long, pulled back into a tail.

Tua kverein.\u201d", "The man laughed, and as he stepped around the desk I saw he wore a long knife in addition to his sword. I\u2019d never seen anyone armed at the University. Here in the Archives, he looked as out of place as a sheep in the king\u2019s court.

There\u2019s a brass plate on his door. I\u2019d walk you back, but we\u2019re short-staffed. I can\u2019t leave the desk.\u201d", "I nodded and began to walk down the hallway. I smiled to hear Wil softly humming the melody from \u201cJackass, Jackass\u201d under his breath. Then the door gave a muffled thump behind me, and the hall was quiet save for the sound of my own breathing. By the time I reached the appropriate door, my hands were clammy with sweat. I knocked.", "\u201cEnter,\u201d Lorren called from inside. His voice was like a sheet of smooth grey slate, without the barest hint of inflection or emotion.", "I opened the door. Lorren sat behind a huge semicircular desk. Shelves lined the walls from floor to ceiling. The room was so full of books there wasn\u2019t more than a palm\u2019s breadth of wall visible in the entire room.", "Lorren looked at me coolly.

Tall, clean-shaven, and wearing his dark master\u2019s robes, he reminded me of the enigmatic Silent Doctor character present in many Modegan plays. I fought off a shiver, trying not to dwell on the fact that the appearance of the Doctor always signaled catastrophe in the next act.", "Lorren went to one of the shelves and pulled out a small book. Even at a glimpse I recognized it as mine. A dark stain patterned the cover from the time it had gotten wet during a storm in Tarbean.", "I fumbled with the strings of my purse, surprised to see my hands trembling slightly \u201cIt was two silver pennies, I believe.\u201d", "Lorren nodded.", "\u201cCan I offer you anything in addition to that?

A scriv in my employ, or an unfamiliar student found guilty of Reckless Use of Sympathy?\u201d", "I manage to regain a little of my composure. \u201cI understand your decision, Master Lorren. But is there anything I might do to earn readmittance?\u201d I asked, unable to keep my voice entirely free of desperation. \u201cHonestly, I would rather be whipped again than spend another term banned. I would give you all the money in my pocket, though it isn\u2019t much. I\u2019d work long hours as a scriv, without pay, for the privilege of proving myself to you. I know you\u2019re short-staffed during exams....\u201d", "Lorren looked at me, his placid eyes almost curious.

He informed me that I was due on the horns at a quarter hour before noon. I was being charged with Conduct Unbecoming a Member of the Arcanum. Ambrose had finally caught wind of my song.", "I spent the next several hours feeling vaguely sick to my stomach. This was exactly what I\u2019d hoped to avoid: an opportunity for both Ambrose and Hemme to settle scores with me. Worse still, this was bound to lower Lorren\u2019s opinion of me even further, no matter what the outcome.", "I arrived in the Masters\u2019 Hall early and was relieved to find the atmosphere much more relaxed than when I\u2019d gone on the horns for malfeasance against Hemme.

But, as they say, the best revenge is living well. So I decided to ignore Ambrose and enjoy my new luxurious lifestyle at the Horse and Four.", "But I only managed two days of revenge. On the third day the Horse and Four had a new owner. Short, jolly Caverin was replaced with a tall, thin man who informed me that my services were no longer required. I was told to vacate my rooms before nightfall.", "It was irritating, but I knew of at least four or five inns of a similar quality on this side of the river that would jump at the chance to employ a musician with his talent pipes.", "But the innkeeper at Hollybush refused to speak with me. The White Hart and Queen\u2019s Crown were content with their current musicians. At the Golden Pony I waited for over an hour before I realized I was being politely ignored. By the time I was turned away by the Royal Oak I was fuming.", "It was Ambrose. I didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d done it, but I knew it was him. Bribes perhaps, or a rumor that any inn employing a certain red-haired musician would be losing the business of a large number of wealthy noble customers.", "So I began working my way through the rest of the inns this side of the river. I\u2019d already been turned away by the upper-class ones, but there were many respectable places left. Over the next several hours, I tried the Shepherd\u2019s Rest, the Boar\u2019s Head, Dog in the Wall, Staves Inn, and The Tabard. Ambrose had been very thorough; none of them were interested.", "It was early evening by the time I came to Anker\u2019s, and by that time the only thing keeping me going was pure black temper. I was determined to try every single inn on this side of the river before I resorted to paying for a bunk and a meal chit again.", "When I came to the inn, Anker himself was up on a ladder nailing a long piece of cedar siding back into place.

Ambrose had bought the Horse and Four just to spite me out of a job. No, he was too clever for that. He had probably loaned the money to a friend and passed it off as a business venture.", "How much had it cost? A thousand talents? Five thousand? I couldn\u2019t even guess how much an inn like the Horse and Four was worth. What was even more disturbing was how quickly he had managed it.", "It put things in sharp perspective for me. I\u2019d known Ambrose was rich, but honestly, everyone was rich compared to me. I\u2019d never bothered thinking about how wealthy he was, or how he could use it against me. I was getting a lesson in the sort of influence a wealthy baron\u2019s firstborn son could bring to bear.", "For the first time I was glad for the University\u2019s strict code of conduct. If Ambrose was willing to go to these lengths, I could only imagine what drastic measures he would take if he didn\u2019t need to maintain a semblance of civility.", "I was jolted out of my reverie by a young woman leaning out the front door of the inn, \u201cDamn you, Anker!\u201d she shouted. \u201cI\u2019m not going to pull and carry while you stand out here scratching your ass! Get in here!\u201d", "Anker muttered something under his breath as he picked up the ladder and he stowed it around the corner in the alleyway. \u201cWhat\u2019d you do to this fellow anyway? Tup his mum?\u201d", "\u201cWrote a song about him, actually.\u201d", "As Anker opened the door of the inn, a gentle welter of conversation poured out onto the street. \u201cI\u2019d be curious to hear a song like that.\u201d He grinned. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come give it a play?\u201d", "\u201cIf you\u2019re sure,\u201d I said, not quite believing my luck. \u201cThere\u2019s bound to be trouble.\u201d", "\u201cTrouble,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cWhat does a boy like you know about trouble? I was in trouble afore you were born. I been in trouble you don\u2019t even got words for.\u201d He turned to face me, still standing in the doorway. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve had music in here regular. Can\u2019t say as I like to go without. A proper tavern has music.\u201d", "I smiled. \u201cI have to agree with you there.\u201d", "\u201cTruth is, I\u2019d have you in just to twist that rich tit\u2019s nose,\u201d Anker said. \u201cBut if you can play worth half a damn....\u201d He pushed the door open farther, making it an invitation. I could smell sawdust and honest sweat and baking bread.", "By the end of the night it was all arranged. In exchange for playing four nights a span, I earned a tiny room on the third floor and the assurance that if I was around at mealtimes I would be welcome to a bit of whatever was cooking in the pot. Admittedly, Anker was getting the services of a talented musician for a bargain price, but it was a deal I was happy to make. Anything was better than going back to Mews and the silent scorn of my bunkmates.", "The ceiling of my tiny room slanted downward in two corners, making it seem even smaller than it really was. It would have been cluttered if there had been more than the few sticks of furniture: a small desk with a wooden chair and a single shelf above it. The bed was flat and narrow as any bunk in the Mews.", "I set my slightly battered copy of Rhetoric and Logic on the shelf over the desk. My lute case leaned comfortably in the corner. Through the window I could see the lights of the University unblinking in the cool autumn air. I was home.", "", "Looking back, I count myself lucky that I ended up in Anker\u2019s. True, the crowds were not as wealthy as those at the Horse and Four, but they appreciated me in a way the nobles never had.", "And while my suite of rooms at the Horse and Four had been luxurious, my tiny room at Anker\u2019s was comfortable. Think in terms of shoes. You don\u2019t want the biggest you can find. You want the pair that fits. In time, that tiny room at Anker\u2019s came to be more of a home to me than anywhere else in the world.", "But at that particular moment, I was furious at what Ambrose had cost me. So when I sat down to write my public letter of apology, it dripped with venomous sincerity. It was a work of art. I beat my breast with remorse. I wailed and gnashed my teeth over the fact that I had maligned a fellow student. I also included a full copy of the lyrics, along with two new verses and full musical notation. I then apologized in excruciating detail about every vulgar, petty innuendo included in the song.", "I then spent four precious jots of my own money on paper and ink and called in the favor Jaxim owed me for trading him my late admissions slot. He had a friend that worked in a print shop, and with his help we printed over a hundred copies of the letter.", "Then, the night before fall term began, Wil, Sim, and I posted them on every flat surface we could find on both sides of the river. We used a lovely alchemical adhesive Simmon had cooked up for the occasion. The stuff went on like paint, then dried clear as glass and hard as steel. If anyone wanted to remove the posts, they\u2019d need a hammer and chisel.", "In hindsight, it was as foolish as taunting an angry bull. And, if I had to guess, I\u2019d say this particular piece of insolence was the main reason Ambrose eventually tried to kill me.", "", "", ""], "CHAPTER SIXTY-TWO": ["CHAPTER SIXTY-TWO", "Leaves", "\nUnder pointed advice from several sources, I limited myself to three fields of study in the upcoming term. I continued Advanced Sympathy with Elxa Dal, held a shift in the Medica, and continued my apprenticeship under Manet. My time was pleasantly full, but not overburdened as it had been last term.", "I studied my artificing more doggedly than anything else. Since my search for a patron had come to a dead end, I knew my best chance for self-sufficiency lay in becoming an artificer. Currently I worked for Kilvin and was given relatively menial jobs at relatively low pay. Once I finished my apprenticeship, that would improve. Better still, I would be able to pursue my own projects then sell them on commission for a profit.", "If. If I was able to keep ahead of my debt to Devi. If I could somehow continue to muster enough money for tuition. If I could finish my apprenticeship under Manet without getting myself killed or crippled by the dangerous work that was done in the Fishery every day....", "", "Forty or fifty of us gathered in the workshop, waiting to see the new arrival. Some sat on the stone worktables to get a good view, while a dozen or so students gathered on the iron catwalks in the rafters among Kilvin\u2019s hanging lamps.", "I saw Manet up there. He was hard to miss: three times older than any of the other students with his wild hair and grizzled beard. I headed up the stairs and made my way to his side. He smiled and clapped me on the shoulder.", "\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I asked. \u201cI thought this was just for the greenwood who haven\u2019t seen this stuff before.\u201d", "\u201cI thought I\u2019d play the dutiful mentor today\u201d he shrugged. \u201cBesides, this particular display is worth watching, if only for the expressions on everyone\u2019s faces.\u201d", "Sitting atop one of the shop\u2019s heavy worktables was a massive cylindrical container about four feet high and two feet across. The edges were sealed without any bulky welds, and the metal had a dull, burnished look that made me guess it was more than simple steel.", "I let my gaze wander the room and was surprised to see Fela standing in the crowd, waiting for the demonstration to begin along with the rest of the students.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t know Fela worked here,\u201d I said to Manet.", "Manet nodded. \u201cOh sure. What, two terms now?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m surprised I haven\u2019t noticed,\u201d I mused as I watched her talking to one of the other women in the crowd.", "\u201cSo am I,\u201d Manet said with a low, knowing chuckle. \u201cBut she\u2019s not here very often. She sculpts and works with cut tile and glass. She\u2019s here for the equipment, not the sygaldry.\u201d", "The belling tower struck the hour outside, and Kilvin looked around, marking the faces of everyone there. I didn\u2019t doubt for a moment that he took note of exactly who was missing. \u201cFor several span we will have this in the shop,\u201d he said simply, gesturing to the metal container that stood nearby. \u201cNearly ten gallons of a volatile transporting agent: Regim Ignaul Neratum.\u201d", "\u201cHe\u2019s the only one that calls it that,\u201d Manet said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s bone-tar.\u201d", "\u201cBone-tar?\u201d", "He nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s caustic. Spill it on your arm and it\u2019ll eat through to the bone in about ten seconds.\u201d", "While everyone watched, Kilvin donned a thick leather glove and decanted about an ounce of dark liquid from the metal canister into a glass vial. \u201cIt is important to chill the vial prior to decanting, as the agent boils at room temperature.\u201d", "He quickly sealed off the vial and held it up for everyone to see. \u201cThe pressure cap is also essential, as the liquid is extremely volatile. As a gas it exhibits surface tension and viscosity, like mercury. It is heavier than air and does not dissipate. It coheres to itself.\u201d", "With no further preamble Kilvin tossed the vial into a nearby firewell, and there was the sharp, clear sound of breaking glass. From this height, I could see the firewell must have been cleaned out specially for this occasion. It was empty, just a shallow, circular pit of bare stone.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a shame he\u2019s not more of a showman,\u201d Manet said softly to me. \u201cElxa Dal could do this with a little more flair.\u201d", "The room was filled with a sharp crackling and hissing as the dark liquid warmed itself against the stone of the firewell and began to boil. From my high vantage, I could see a thick, oily smoke slowly filling the bottom of the well. It didn\u2019t behave like fog or smoke at all. Its edges didn\u2019t diffuse. It pooled, and hung together like a tiny, dark cloud.", "Manet tapped me on the shoulder, and I looked at him just in time to avoid being blinded by the initial burst of flame as the cloud caught fire. There were dismayed noises from all around and I guessed most of the others had been caught unaware. Manet grinned at me and gave a knowing wink.", "\u201cThanks,\u201d I said and turned back to watch. Jagged flames danced across the surface of the fog, colored a bright sodium-red. The additional heat made the dark fog boil faster, and it swelled until the flames were licking toward the top of the waist-high lip of the firewell. Even from where I stood on the catwalk I could feel a gentle heat on my face.", "\u201cWhat the hell do you call that?\u201d I asked him quietly. \u201cFire-fog?\u201d", "\u201cWe could,\u201d he responded. \u201cKilvin would probably call it an atmospherically activated incendiary action.\u201d", "The fire flickered and died all at once, leaving the room filled with the acrid smell of hot stone.", "\u201cIn addition to being highly corrosive,\u201d Kilvin said, \u201cin its gaseous state the reagent is flammable. Once it warms sufficienctly, it will burn on contact with air. The heat that this produces can cause a cascading exothermic reaction.\u201d", "\u201cCascading huge Goddamn fire,\u201d Manet said.", "\u201cYou\u2019re better than a chorus,\u201d I said softly, trying to keep a straight face.", "Kilvin gestured. \u201cThis container is designed to keep the agent cold and under pressure. Be mindful while it remains in the workshop. Avoid excessive heat in its immediate vicinity.\u201d With that, Kilvin turned and headed back into his office.", "\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d I asked.", "Manet shrugged. \u201cWhat else needs to be said? Kilvin doesn\u2019t let anyone work here unless they\u2019re careful, and now everyone knows what to be careful of.\u201d", "\u201cWhy is it even here?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s it good for?\u201d", "\u201cScares the hell out of the first-termers.\u201d He grinned.", "\u201cAnything more practical than that?\u201d", "\u201cFear is plenty practical,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you can use it to make a different type of emitter for sympathy lamps. You get a bluish light instead of the ordinary red. A little easier on the eyes. Fetch outrageous prices.\u201d", "I looked down into the workshop, but couldn\u2019t see Fela anywhere in the milling bodies. I turned back to Manet. \u201cWant to keep playing dutiful mentor and show me how?\u201d", "He absently ran his hands through his wild hair and shrugged. \u201cSure.\u201d", "", "I was playing at Anker\u2019s later that night when I caught the eye of a beautiful girl sitting at one of the crowded tables in back. She looked remarkably like Denna, but I knew that to be nothing more than my own fancy. I hoped to see her enough that I had been catching glimpses of her out of the corner of my eye for days.", "My second glance told me the truth....", "It was Denna, singing along with half the folk in Anker\u2019s to \u201cDrover\u2019s Daughters.\u201d She saw I was looking in her direction and waved.", "Her appearance caught me so much by surprise that I completely forgot what my fingers were doing and my song fell to pieces. Everyone laughed, and I took a grand bow to hide my embarrassment. They cheered and booed me in equal amounts for a minute or so, enjoying my failure more than they had the song itself. Such is human nature.", "I waited for their attention to drift away from me, then made my way casually to where Denna was sitting.", "She stood to greet me. \u201cI\u2019d heard you were playing on this side of the river,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t imagine how you keep the job if you fall apart every time a girl gives you a wink.\u201d", "I felt myself flush a little. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen that often.\u201d", "\u201cThe winking or the falling apart?\u201d", "Unable to think of a response, I felt myself flush redder, and she laughed. \u201cHow long will you be playing tonight?\u201d She asked.", "\u201cNot much longer,\u201d I lied. I owed Anker at least another hour.", "She brightened. \u201cGood. Come away with me afterward, I need someone to walk with.\u201d", "Hardly believing my good luck, I made a bow to her. \u201cAt your service certainly Let me go and finish up.\u201d I made my way to the bar where Anker and two of his serving girls were busy pulling drinks.", "Unable to catch his eye, I grabbed hold of his apron as he hurried past me. He jerked to a stop and barely avoided spilling a tray of drinks onto a table of customers. \u201cGod\u2019s teeth boy. What\u2019s the matter w\u2019ye?\u201d", "\u201cAnker, I\u2019ve got to go. I can\u2019t stay till closing tonight.\u201d", "His face soured. \u201cCrowds like this don\u2019t come for the askin\u2019.

But I\u2019ve got to go after that.\u201d I gave him a desperate look. \u201cI swear I\u2019ll make it up to you.\u201d", "He looked at me more closely. \u201cAre ye in trouble?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cIt\u2019s a girl then.\u201d He turned his head at the sound of voices calling for more drinks, then waved me away, briskly. \u201cFine, go. But mind you, make it a good, long song. And you\u2019ll owe me.\u201d", "I moved to the front of the room and clapped my hands for the room\u2019s attention. Once the room was moderately quiet I began to play. By the time I struck the third chord everyone knew what it was: \u201cTinker Tanner.\u201d The oldest song in the world. I took my hands from the lute and began to clap. Soon everyone was pounding out the rhythm in unison, feet against the floor, mugs on tabletops.", "The sound was almost overwhelming, but it faded appropriately when I sang the first verse. Then I led the room in the chorus with everyone singing along, some with their own words, some in their own keys. I moved to a nearby table as I finished my second verse and led the room in the chorus again.", "Then I gestured expectantly toward the table to sing a verse of their own. It took a couple of seconds for them to realize what I wanted, but the expectation of the whole room was enough to encourage one of the more tipsy students to shout out a verse of his own. It gained him thunderous applause and cheers. Then, as everyone sang the chorus again, I moved to another table and did the same thing.", "Before too long folk were taking initiative to sing out their own verses when the chorus was over. I made my way to where Denna waited by the outer door, and together we slipped out into the early evening twilight.", "\u201cThat was cleverly done,\u201d she said as we began to stroll away from the tavern. \u201cHow long to you think they\u2019ll keep it up?\u201d", "\u201cThat will all depend on how quickly Anker manages to pull down drinks for the lot of them.\u201d I came to a stop at the edge of the alley that ran between the back of Anker\u2019s tavern and the bakery next door. \u201cIf you will excuse me a moment, I have to put my lute away.\u201d", "\u201cIn an alley?\u201d she asked.", "\u201cIn my room.\u201d Stepping lightly, I moved quickly up the side of the building. Right foot rain barrel, left foot window ledge, left hand iron drainpipe, and I swung myself onto the lip of the first story roof. I hopped across the alley to the roof of the bakery and smiled at her startled intake of breath. From there it was a short stroll upward and I hopped back across to the second story roof of Anker\u2019s. Tripping the latch to my window, I reached through and set my lute lightly on my bed before heading back down the way I had come.", "\u201cDoes Anker charge a penny every time you use his stairs?\u201d she asked as I neared the ground.", "I stepped down from the rainbarrel and brushed my hands against my pants. \u201cI come and go at odd hours,\u201d I explained easily as I fell into step beside her. \u201cAm I correct in understanding that you are looking for a gentleman to walk with you tonight?\u201d", "A smile curved her lips as she looked sideways at me. \u201cQuite.\u201d", "\u201cThat is unfortunate,\u201d I sighed. \u201cI am no gentleman.\u201d", "Her smile grew. \u201cI think that you are close enough.\u201d", "\u201cI would like to be closer.\u201d", "\u201cThen come walking with me.\u201d", "\u201cIt would please me greatly.

Yes, I\u2019ll excuse it this time.\u201d", "\u201cThe trouble is, when you gift a girl with flowers your choice can be construed so many different ways. A man might give you a rose because he feels you are beautiful, or because he fancies their shade or shape or softness similar to your lips. Roses are expensive, and perhaps he wishes to show through a valuable gift that you are valuable to him.\u201d", "\u201cYou make a good case for roses,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact remains I do not like them. Pick another flower to suit me.\u201d", "\u201cBut what suits? When a man gives you a rose what you see may not be what he intends. You may think he sees you as delicate or frail. Perhaps you dislike a suitor who considers you all sweet and nothing else. Perhaps the stem is thorned, and you assume he thinks you likely to hurt a hand too quick to touch. But if he trims the thorns you might think he has no liking for a thing that can defend itself with sharpness. There\u2019s so many ways a thing can be interpreted,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat is a careful man to do?\u201d", "She cast a sidelong look to me. \u201cIf the man is you, I\u2019d guess he would spin clever words and hope the question was forgotten.\u201d She tilted her head. \u201cIt isn\u2019t.

Hmmm, there\u2019s a thing. A fair flower. Doesn\u2019t take to cultivation.

Why?\u201d", "\u201cIt is a deep red flower that grows on a strong vine. Its leaves are dark and delicate. They grow best in shadowy places, but the flower itself finds stray sunbeams to bloom in.\u201d I looked at her. \u201cThat suits you. There is much of you that is both shadow and light. It grows in deep forests, and is rare because only skilled folk can tend one without harming it. It has a wondrous smell and is much sought and seldom found.\u201d I paused and made a point of examining her. \u201cYes, since I am forced to pick, I would choose selas.\u201d", "She looked at me. Looked away. \u201cYou think too much of me.\u201d", "I smiled. \u201cPerhaps you think too little of yourself.\u201d", "She caught a piece of my smile and shone it back at me. \u201cYou were closer early in your list.

Your flattery is naught to me but wind!\u201d", "She watched me for a moment, as if to make sure my tirade was complete. \u201cBeyond all other trees,\u201d she said with a curl of a smile on her elegant mouth, \u201cthe willow moves to the wind\u2019s desire.\u201d", "", "The stars told me five hours had passed. But it seemed hardly any time at all before we came to the Oaken Oar where she was staying in Imre. At the doorway there was a moment that lasted for an hour as I considered kissing her.

When she looked sideways at me with her secret smile, the tilt of her head, the way she almost faced me made me think she must be hoping for me to do ... something. Put my arm around her? Kiss her? How did one know? How could I be certain?", "I couldn\u2019t. So I resisted the pull of her. I did not want to presume too much, did not want to offend her or embarrass myself. What\u2019s more, Deoch\u2019s warning had made me uncertain. Perhaps what I felt was nothing more than Denna\u2019s natural charm, her charisma.", "Like all boys of my age, I was an idiot when it came to women. The difference between me and the others is that I was painfully aware of my ignorance, while others like Simmon bumbled around, making asses of themselves with their clumsy courting.

Your making this lamp is an attempt to show that you are better than the ordinary apprentice, is it not?\u201d As he said this, Kilvin looked directly at me, and for a moment there was none of his characteristic distraction lurking behind his eyes.", "I felt my mouth go dry. Underneath his shaggy beard and heavily accented Aturan, Kilvin had a mind like a diamond.

And you are right, I do know these things.\u201d He thumbed the lamp on and off while pointing it at different things around the room. \u201cAnd in all fairness, I am duly impressed with your skill.

It would gravitate to the wrong people. If a burglar were caught with such a tool it would reflect badly on all arcanists. You have completed your apprenticeship, and distinguished yourself in terms of skill.\u201d I relaxed a bit. \u201cBut your greater judgment is still somewhat in question. The lamp itself we will melt down for metals, I suppose.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re going to melt down my lamp?\u201d I had worked for a full span on the lamp and invested almost all the money I had on the purchase of raw materials.

I kept my mixed success with the lamp to myself", "\u201cAbout time,\u201d Wil said dryly. \u201cTook you what, almost three months? People were beginning to say that you had lost your touch.\u201d", "\u201cI thought you\u2019d be more pleased,\u201d I said as I peeled the wax off the top of the bottle. \u201cMy days of being a pinchpenny might be coming to an end.\u201d", "Sim made a dismissive noise. \u201cYou stand your round well enough,\u201d he said.", "\u201cI drink to your continued success as an artificer,\u201d Wil said, sliding his cup toward me. \u201cKnowing it will lead to more drinks in the future.\u201d", "\u201cPlus,\u201d I said as I stripped the last of the wax away, \u201cthere\u2019s always the chance that if I get you drunk enough you\u2019ll let me slip into the Archives someday when you\u2019re working the desk.\u201d I kept my tone carefully jovial as I glanced up at him to gauge his reaction.", "Wil took a slow drink, not meeting my eye. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d", "Disappointment nestled sourly in the pit of my stomach. I made a dismissive gesture, as if I couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d taken my joke seriously. \u201cOh, I know\u2014\u201d", "\u201cI thought about it,\u201d Wilem interrupted. \u201cSeeing as how you didn\u2019t deserve the punishment you got, and I know how much it\u2019s been bothering you.\u201d Wil took a drink. \u201cLorren occasionally suspends students. A handful of days for too loud talking in the Tombs. A few span if they are careless with a book. But banned is different. That hasn\u2019t happened in years. Everyone knows. If anyone saw you ...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019d lose my position as scriv. We could both get expelled.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t beat yourself up,\u201d I said. \u201cJust the fact that you considered it means\u2014\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019re getting maudlin here,\u201d Sim broke in, knocking his glass against the table. \u201cOpen the bottle and we\u2019ll drink to Kilvin being so impressed that he talks to Lorren and gets you unbanned from the Archives.\u201d", "I smiled and began to work a screw into the cork. \u201cI have a better plan,\u201d I said. \u201cI vote we drink to the perpetual confusation and botherment of a certain Ambrose Jakis.\u201d", "\u201cI think we can all agree to that,\u201d Wil said, raising his glass.", "\u201cGreat God,\u201d Simmon said in a hushed tone. \u201cLook what Deoch found.\u201d", "\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I asked, concentrating on getting the cork out all in one piece.", "\u201cHe\u2019s managed to get the most beautiful woman in the place again.\u201d Sim\u2019s grumble was uncharacteristically surly. \u201cIt\u2019s enough to make you hate a man.\u201d", "\u201cSim, your taste in women is questionable at best.\u201d The cork came free with a pleasing sound and I held it up triumphantly for them to see. Neither of them paid me any attention, their eyes pinned to the doorway", "I turned to look. Paused. \u201cThat\u2019s Denna.\u201d", "Sim turned back to look at me. \u201cDenna?\u201d", "I frowned. \u201cDianne. Denna. She\u2019s the one I told you about before. The one who sang with me. She goes by a lot of different names. I don\u2019t know why.\u201d", "Wilem gave me a flat look. \u201c That\u2019s your girl?\u201d he asked, his voice thick with disbelief.", "\u201cDeoch\u2019s girl,\u201d Simmon amended gently.", "It seemed to be the case. Handsome, muscular Deoch was talking to her in that easy way he had. Denna laughed and put an arm around him in a casual embrace. I felt a heavy weight settle in my chest as I watched them talk.", "Then Deoch turned and pointed. She followed his gesture, met my eyes, and lit up as she smiled at me. I returned the smile by reflex alone. My heart began to beat again. I waved her over. After a quick word to Deoch she began to make her way through the crowd toward us.", "I took a quick drink of scutten as Simmon turned to look at me with an almost reverent disbelief.", "I had never seen Denna dressed in anything other than traveling clothes. But tonight she was wearing a dark green dress that left her arms and shoulders bare. She was stunning. She knew it. She smiled.", "The three of us stood as she approached. \u201cI was hoping to find you here,\u201d she said.", "I gave a small bow. \u201cI was hoping to be found. These are two of my best friends. Simmon.\u201d Sim smiled sunnily and brushed his hair away from his eyes. \u201cAnd Wilem.\u201d Wil nodded. \u201cThis is Dianne.\u201d", "She lounged into a chair. \u201cWhat brings such a group of handsome young men out on the town tonight?\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019re plotting the downfall of our enemies,\u201d Simmon said.", "\u201cAnd celebrating,\u201d I hurried to add.", "Wilem raised his glass in a salute. \u201cConfusion to the enemy.\u201d", "Simmon and I followed suit, but I stopped when I remembered Denna didn\u2019t have a glass. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cCan I buy you a drink?\u201d", "\u201cI was hoping you would buy me dinner,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I would feel guilty about stealing you away from your friends.\u201d", "My mind raced as I tried to think of a tactful way to extricate myself.", "\u201cYou\u2019re making the assumption that we want him here,\u201d Wilem said with a straight face. \u201cYou\u2019d do us a favor if you took him away.\u201d", "Denna leaned forward intently, a smile brushing the pink corners of her mouth. \u201cReally?\u201d", "Wilem nodded gravely. \u201cHe drinks even more than he talks.\u201d", "She darted a teasing look at me. \u201cThat much?\u201d", "\u201cBesides,\u201d Simmon chimed in innocently. \u201cHe\u2019d sulk for days if he missed a chance to be with you. He\u2019ll be completely worthless to us if you leave him here.\u201d", "My face grew hot and I had the sudden urge to throttle Sim. Denna laughed sweetly. \u201cI suppose I\u2019d better take him then.\u201d She stood with a motion like a willow wand bending to the wind and offered me her hand. I took it. \u201cI hope to see you again, Wilem, Simmon.\u201d", "They waved and we started to make our way to the door. \u201cI like them,\u201d she said. \u201cWilem is a stone in deep water. Simmon is like a boy splashing in a brook.\u201d", "Her description startled a laugh from me. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have said it better. You mentioned dinner?\u201d", "\u201cI lied,\u201d she said with an easy delight. \u201cBut I would love the drink you offered me.\u201d", "\u201cHow about the Taps?\u201d", "She wrinkled her nose. \u201cToo many old men, not enough trees. It is a good night to be out of doors.\u201d", "I gestured toward the door. \u201cLead the way.\u201d", "She did. I basked in her reflected light and the stares of envious men. As we left the Eolian, even Deoch looked a little jealous. But as I passed him I caught a glimmer of something other in his eye. Sadness? Pity?", "I spared no time for it. I was with Denna.", "", "We bought a loaf of dark bread and a bottle of Avennish strawberry wine. Then found a private place in one of the many public gardens scattered throughout Imre. The first of autumn\u2019s falling leaves danced along the streets beside us. Denna removed her shoes and danced lightly through the shadows, delighting in the feel of the grass beneath her feet.", "We settled on a bench beneath a great spreading willow, then abandoned it and found more comfortable seats on the ground at the foot of the tree. The bread was thick and dark, and tearing chunks of it gave us distraction for our hands. The wine was sweet and light, and after Denna kissed the bottle it left her lips wet for an hour.", "It had the desperate feel of the last warm night of summer. We spoke of everything and nothing, and all the while I could hardly breathe for the nearness of her, the way she moved, the sound of her voice as it touched the autumn air.", "\u201cYour eyes were far away just then,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d", "I shrugged, buying a moment to think. I couldn\u2019t tell her the truth. I knew every man must compliment her, bury her in flattery more cloying than roses. I took a subtler path. \u201cOne of the masters at the University once told me that there were seven words that would make a woman love you.\u201d I made a deliberately casual shrug. \u201cI was just wondering what they were.\u201d", "\u201cIs that why you talk so much? Hoping to come on them by accident?\u201d", "I opened my mouth to retort. Then, seeing her dancing eyes, I pressed my lips together and tried to fight down my embarrassed flush. She lay a hand on my arm. \u201cDon\u2019t go quiet on my account, Kvothe,\u201d she said gently. \u201cI\u2019d miss the sound of your voice.\u201d", "She took a drink of wine. \u201cAnyway, you shouldn\u2019t bother wondering. You spoke them to me when first we met. You said, I was just wondering why you\u2019re here.\u201d She made a flippant gesture. \u201cFrom that moment I was yours.\u201d", "My mind flashed back to our first meeting in Roent\u2019s caravan. I was stunned. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you remembered.\u201d", "She paused in tearing a piece of dark bread away from the loaf and looked up at me quizzically. \u201cRemember what?\u201d", "\u201cRemembered me. Remembered our meeting in Roent\u2019s caravan.\u201d", "\u201cCome now,\u201d she teased. \u201cHow could I forget the red-haired boy who left me for the University?\u201d", "I was too stunned to point out that I hadn\u2019t left her. Not really. \u201cYou never mentioned it.\u201d", "\u201cNeither did you,\u201d she countered. \u201cPerhaps I thought that you had forgotten me.\u201d", "\u201cForget you? How could I?\u201d", "She smiled at that, but looked down at her hands. \u201cYou might be surprised what men forget,\u201d she said, then lightened her tone. \u201cBut then again, perhaps not. I don\u2019t doubt that you\u2019ve forgotten things, being a man yourself.\u201d", "\u201cI remember your name, Denna.\u201d It sounded good to say it to her. \u201cWhy did you take a new one? Or was Denna just the name that you were wearing on the road to Anilin?\u201d", "\u201cDenna,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI\u2019d almost forgotten her. She was a silly girl.\u201d", "\u201cShe was like a flower unfolding.\u201d", "\u201cI stopped being Denna years ago, it seems.\u201d She rubbed her bare arms and looked around as if she was suddenly uneasy that someone might find us here.", "\u201cShould I call you Dianne, then? Would you like it better?\u201d", "The wind stirred the hanging branches of the willow as she cocked her head to look at me. Her hair mimicked the motion of the trees. \u201cYou are kind. I think I like Denna best from you. It sounds different when you say it. Gentle.\u201d", "\u201cDenna it is,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cWhat happened in Anilin, anyway?\u201d", "A leaf floated down and landed in her hair. She brushed it away absent-mindedly. \u201cNothing pleasant,\u201d she said, avoiding my eyes. \u201cBut nothing unexpected either.\u201d", "I held out my hand and she passed me back the loaf of bread. \u201cWell I\u2019m glad you made it back,\u201d I said. \u201cMy Aloine.\u201d", "She made a decidedly unladylike noise. \u201cPlease, if either of us is Savien, it\u2019s me. I\u2019m the one that came looking for you,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cTwice.\u201d", "\u201cI look,\u201d I protested. \u201cI just don\u2019t seem to have a knack for finding you.\u201d She rolled her eyes dramatically \u201cIf you could recommend an auspicious time and place to look for you, it would make a world of difference....\u201d I trailed off gently, making it a question. \u201cPerhaps tomorrow?\u201d", "Denna gave me a sideways glance, smiling. \u201cYou\u2019re always so cautious,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never known a man to step so carefully.\u201d She looked at my face as if it were a puzzle she could solve. \u201cI expect noon would be an auspicious time tomorrow. At the Eolian.\u201d", "I felt a warm glow at the thought of meeting her again. \u201cI was just wondering why you\u2019re here,\u201d I mused aloud, remembering the conversation that seemed so long ago. \u201cYou called me a liar, afterward.\u201d", "She leaned forward to touch my hand in a consoling way. She smelled of strawberry, and her lips were a dangerous red even in the moonlight. \u201cHow well I knew you, even then.\u201d", "We talked through the long hours of night. I spoke subtle circles around the way I felt, not wanting to be overbold. I thought she might be doing the same, but I could never be sure. It was like we were doing one of those elaborate Modegan court dances, where the partners stand scant inches apart, but\u2014if they are skilled\u2014never touch.", "Such was our conversation. But not only were we lacking touch to guide us, it was as if we were also strangely deaf. So we danced very carefully, unsure what music the other was listening to, unsure, perhaps, if the other was dancing at all.", "", "Deoch was standing vigil at the door, same as always. He waved to see me. \u201cMaster Kvothe. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve missed your friends.\u201d", "\u201cI thought I might\u2019ve. How long have they been gone?\u201d", "\u201cOnly an hour.\u201d He stretched his arms above his head, grimacing. Then let them fall to his sides with a weary sigh.", "\u201cDid they seem put out that I abandoned them?\u201d", "He grinned. \u201cNot terribly They happened on a couple lovelies of their own. Not as lovely as yours, of course.\u201d He looked uncomfortable for a moment, then spoke slowly as if he were picking his words with great care. \u201cLook, s ... Kvothe. I know it\u2019s not my place, and I hope you don\u2019t take it wrong.\u201d He looked around and suddenly spat. \u201cDamn. I\u2019m no good at this sort of thing.\u201d", "He looked back at me and gestured vaguely with his hands. \u201cYou see, women are like fires, like flames. Some women are like candles, bright and friendly Some are like single sparks, or embers, like fireflies for chasing on summer nights. Some are like campfires, all light and heat for a night and willing to be left after. Some women are like hearthfires, not much to look at but underneath they are all warm red coal that burns a long, long while.", "\u201cBut Dianne ... Dianne is like a waterfall of spark pouring off a sharp iron edge that God is holding to the grindstone. You can\u2019t help but look, can\u2019t help but want it. You might even put your hand to it for a second. But you can\u2019t hold it. She\u2019ll break your heart....\u201d", "The evening was too fresh in my memory for me to pay much heed to Deoch\u2019s warning. I smiled, \u201cDeoch, my heart is made of stronger stuff than glass. When she strikes she\u2019ll find it strong as iron-bound brass, or gold and adamant together mixed. Don\u2019t think I am unaware, some startled deer to stand transfixed by hunter\u2019s horns. It\u2019s she who should take care, for when she strikes, my heart will make a sound so beautiful and bright that it can\u2019t help but bring her back to me in winged flight.\u201d", "My words startled Deoch into bemused laugher. \u201cGod you\u2019re brave,\u201d he shook his head. \u201cAnd young. I wish I were as brave and young as you.\u201d Still smiling, he turned to enter the Eolian. \u201cGood night then.\u201d", "\u201cGood night.\u201d", "Deoch wished that he were more like me? It was as great a compliment as any I had ever been given.", "But even better than that was the fact that my days of fruitlessly searching for Denna were at an end. Tomorrow at noon in the Eolian: \u201clunch and talking and walking\u201d as she had phrased it. The thought filled me with a giddy excitement.", "How young I was. How foolish. How wise.", "", "", ""], "CHAPTER SIXTY-SIX": ["CHAPTER SIXTY-SIX", "Volatile", "\nI woke early the next morning, nervous at the thought of lunch with Denna. Knowing it would be useless to attempt to get back to sleep, I headed to the Fishery. Last night\u2019s extravagant spending had left me with exactly three pennies in my pocket, and I was eager to take advantage of my newly earned position.", "Usually I worked nights in the Fishery. It was a different place in the mornings. There were only fifteen or twenty people there pursuing their individual projects. In the evenings there were usually twice that many. Kilvin was in his office, as always, but the atmosphere was more relaxed: busy, but not bustling.", "I even saw Fela off in the corner of the shop, chipping carefully away at a piece of obsidian the size of a large loaf of bread. Small wonder I\u2019d never seen her here before if she made a habit of being in the shop this early.", "Despite Manet\u2019s warning, I decided to make a batch of blue emitters for my first project. Tricky work, as it required the use of bone-tar, but they would sell fairly quickly, and the whole process would only take me four or five hours of careful work. Not only could I be done in time to meet with Denna at the Eolian for lunch, but I might be able to get a small advance from Kilvin so I could have a bit of money in my purse when I went to meet her.", "I gathered the necessary tools and set up in one of the fume hoods along the eastern wall. I chose a place near a drench, one of the five-hundred-gallon tanks of twice-tough glass that were spaced throughout the workshop. If you spilled something dangerous on yourself while working in the hoods, you could simply pull the drench\u2019s handle and rinse yourself clean in a stream of cool water.", "Of course I would never need the drench so long as I was careful. But it was nice having it close, just in case.", "After setting up the fume hood, I made my way to the table where the bone-tar was kept. Despite the fact that I knew it was no more dangerous than a stone saw or the sintering wheel, I found the burnished metal container unnerving.", "And today something was different. I caught the attention of one of the more experienced artificers as he walked past. Jaxim had the haggard look common to most artificers in the middle of large projects, as if he were putting off sleep until it was entirely finished.", "\u201cShould there be this much frost?\u201d I asked him, pointing out the tar canister. Its edges were covered in fine white tufts of frost, like tiny shrubs. The air around the metal actually shimmered with cold.", "Jaxim peered at it, then shrugged. \u201cBetter too cold than not cold enough,\u201d he said with a humorless chuckle. \u201cHeh heh. Kaboom.\u201d", "I couldn\u2019t help but agree, and guessed that it might have something to do with the workshop being cooler this early in the morning. None of the kilns had been fired up yet, and most of the forge fires were still banked and sullen.", "Moving carefully, I ran through the decanting procedure in my head, making sure I hadn\u2019t forgotten anything. It was so cold that my breath hung white in the air. The sweat on my hands froze my fingers to the canister\u2019s fastenings the same way a curious child\u2019s tongue sticks to a pump handle in the dead of winter.", "I decanted about an ounce of the thick, oily liquid into the pressure vial and quickly applied the cap. Then I made my way back to the fume hood and started preparing my materials. After a few tense minutes, I began the long, meticulous process of preparing and doping a set of blue emitters.", "My concentration was broken two hours later by a voice behind me. It wasn\u2019t particularly loud, but it held a serious tone you never ignore in the Fishery.", "It said, \u201cOh my God.\u201d", "Because of my current work, the first thing I looked at was the bone-tar canister. I felt a flash of cold sweat roll over me when I saw black liquid leaking from one corner and running down the worktable\u2019s leg to pool on the floor. The thick timber of the table\u2019s leg was almost entirely eaten away, and I heard a light popping and crackling as the liquid pooling on the floor began to boil. All I could think of was Kilvin\u2019s statement during the demonstration: In addition to being highly corrosive, the gas burns when it comes in contact with air....", "Even as I turned to look, the leg gave way and the worktable began to tip. The burnished metal canister tumbled down. When it struck the stone floor, the metal was so cold it didn\u2019t simply crack or dent, it shattered like glass. Gallons of the dark fluid burst out in a great splay across the workshop floor. The room filled with sharp crackling and popping sounds as the bone-tar spread across the warm stone floor and started to boil.", "Long ago, the clever person who designed the Fishery placed about two dozen drains in the workshop to help with cleaning and managing spills. What\u2019s more, the workshop\u2019s stone floor rose and fell in a gentle pattern of peaks and troughs to guide the spills toward those drains. That meant as soon as the container shattered, the wide spill of oily liquid began to run off in two different directions, heading for two different drains. At the same time it continued to boil, forming thick, low clouds, dark as tar, caustic, and ready to burst into flame.", "Trapped between these two spreading arms of dark fog was Fela, who had been working by herself at an out-of-the-way table in the corner of the shop. She stood, her mouth half open in shock. She was dressed practically for work in the shop, light trousers and a gauzy linen shirt cuffed at the elbow. Her long, dark hair was pulled back into a tail, but still hung down to nearly the small of her back. She would burn like a torch.", "The room began to fill with frantic noise as people realized what was happening. They shouted orders or simply yelled in panic. They dropped tools and knocked over half-finished projects as they scrambled around.", "Fela hadn\u2019t screamed or called for help, which meant no one but me had noticed the danger she was in. If Kilvin\u2019s demonstration was any indication, I guessed the whole shop could be a sea of flame and caustic fog in less than a minute. There wasn\u2019t any time....", "I glanced at the scattered projects on the nearby worktable, looking for anything that could be of some help. But there was nothing: a jumble of basalt blocks, spools of copper wire, a half-inscribed hemisphere of glass that was probably destined to become one of Kilvin\u2019s lamps....", "And as easy as that, I knew what I had to do. I grabbed the glass hemisphere and dashed it against one of the basalt blocks. It shattered and I was left with a thin, curved shard of broken glass about the size of my palm. With my other hand I grabbed my cloak from the table and strode past the fume hood.", "I pressed my thumb against the edge of the piece of glass and felt an unpleasant tugging sensation followed by a sharp pain. Knowing I\u2019d drawn blood, I smeared my thumb across the glass and spoke a binding. As I came to stand in front of the drench I dropped the glass to the floor, concentrated, and stepped down hard, crushing it with my heel.", "Cold unlike anything I\u2019d ever felt stabbed into me. Not the simple cold you feel in your skin and limbs on a winter day. It hit my body like a clap of thunder. I felt it in my tongue and lungs and liver.", "But I got what I wanted. The twice-tough glass of the drench spiderwebbed into a thousand fractures, and I closed my eyes just as it burst. Five hundred gallons of water struck me like a great fist, knocking me back a step and soaking me through to the skin. Then I was off, running between the tables.", "Quick as I was, I wasn\u2019t quick enough. There was a blinding crimson flare from the corner of the workshop as the fog began to catch fire, sending up strangely angular tongues of violent red flame. The fire would heat the rest of the tar, causing it to boil more quickly. This would make more fog, more fire, and more heat.", "As I ran, the fire spread. It followed the two trails the bone-tar made as it ran toward the drains. The flames shot up with startling ferocity, sending up two curtains of fire, effectively cutting off the far corner of the shop. The flames were already as tall as me, and growing.", "Fela had worked her way out from behind the workbench and hurried along the wall toward one of the floor drains. Since the bone-tar was pouring down the grate, there was a gap close to the wall clear of flame or fog. Fela was just about to sprint past when dark fog began to boil up out of the grate. She gave a short, startled shriek as she backed away. The fog was burning even as it boiled up, engulfing everything in a roiling pool of flame.", "I finally made my way past the last table. Without slowing I held my breath, closed my eyes, and jumped over the fog, not wanting to let the horrible corrosive stuff touch my legs. I felt a brief, intense flash of heat on my hands and face, but my wet clothing kept me from being burned or catching fire.", "Since my eyes were closed, I landed awkwardly, banging my hip against the stone top of a worktable. I ignored it and ran to Fela.", "She had been backing away from the fire toward the outer wall of the shop, but now she was staring at me, hands half-raised protectively. \u201cPut your arms down!\u201d I shouted as I ran up to her, spreading my dripping-wet cloak with both hands. I don\u2019t know if she heard me over the roar of the flames, but regardless, Fela understood. She lowered her hands and stepped toward the cloak.", "As I closed the final distance between us, I glanced behind and saw the fire was growing even faster than I\u2019d expected. The fog clung to the floor, over a foot deep, black as pitch. The flames were so high I couldn\u2019t see to the other side, let alone guess how thick the wall of fire had become.", "Just before Fela stepped into the cloak, I lifted it to completely engulf her head. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to carry you out.\u201d I shouted as I bundled the cloak around her. \u201cYour legs will burn if you try to wade through.\u201d She said something in reply, but it was muffled by the layers of wet cloth and I couldn\u2019t make it out over the roar of the fire.", "I picked her up, not in front of me, like Prince Gallant out of some storybook, but over one shoulder, the way you carry a sack of potatoes. Her hip pressed hard into my shoulder and I pelted toward the fire. The heat battered the front of my body, and I threw my free arm up to protect my face, praying the moisture on my pants would save my legs from the worst of the corrosive nature of the fog.", "I drew a deep breath just before I hit the fire, but the air was sharp and acrid. I coughed reflexively and sucked down another lungful of the burning air just as I entered the wall of flame. I felt the sharp chill of the fog around my lower legs and there was fire all around me as I ran, coughing and drawing in more bad air. I grew dizzy and tasted ammonia. Some distant, rational part of my mind thought: of course, to make it volatile.", "Then nothing.", "", "When I awoke, the first thing that sprang to my mind was not what you might expect.

I was supposed to have met with Denna at the Eolian an hour ago.", "Miserable and with a sour knot in my stomach, I took in my surroundings.

The bed was a giveaway too: comfortable enough to sleep in, but not so comfortable that you\u2019d want to lie around.", "I turned my head and saw a familiar pair of striking green eyes framed by close-cropped blond hair. \u201cOh,\u201d I relaxed back onto the pillow. \u201cHello Mola.\u201d", "Mola stood next to one of the tall counters that lined the edges of the room.

I don\u2019t think she was really with him, if you catch my meaning. She\u2019s been looking for a patron, and this fellow had that sort of look about him.

It was only then, hearing it from other people, that I realized what I had done.", "I was used to people talking about me. As I\u2019ve said, I had been actively building a reputation for myself. But this was different; this was real. People were already embroidering the details and confusing parts, but the heart of the story was still there.

If not, I might at least be able to reclaim my missing cloak.", "Surprisingly, the majority of the Fishery made it through the fire without much damage at all, but the northeast quarter of the shop was practically destroyed. There was nothing left but a jumble of broken stone and glass and ash. Bright blurs of copper and silver spread over broken tabletops and portions of the floor where various metals had been melted by the heat of the fire.", "More unsettling than the wreckage was the fact that the workshop was deserted. I\u2019d never seen the place empty before. I knocked on Kilvin\u2019s office door, then peered inside. Empty. That made a certain amount of sense. Without Kilvin, there was no one to organize the clean up.", "Finishing the emitters took hours longer than I\u2019d expected. My injuries distracted me, and my bandaged thumb made my hand slightly clumsy. As with most artificing, this job required two skilled hands. Even the minor encumbrance of a bandage was a serious inconvenience.", "Still, I finished the project without incident and was just preparing to test the emitters when I heard Kilvin in the hallway, cursing in Siaru. I glanced over my shoulder just in time to see him stomp through the doorway toward his office, followed by one of Master Arwyl\u2019s gillers.", "I closed the fume hood and walked toward Kilvin\u2019s office, mindful of where I set my bare feet. Through the window, I could see Kilvin waving his arms like a farmer shooing crows. His hands were swathed in white bandages nearly to the elbow. \u201cEnough,\u201d he said. \u201cI will tend them myself.\u201d", "The man caught hold of one of Kilvin\u2019s arms and made adjustments to the bandages. Kilvin pulled his hands away and held them high in the air, out of reach. \u201cLhinsatva. Enough is enough.\u201d The man said something too quiet for me to hear, but Kilvin continued to shake his head. \u201cNo. And no more of your drugs.

Kilvin gave me a dark look. \u201cDo you see what I find after the fire is quenched?\u201d He asked, gesturing toward a mass of dark cloth on his private worktable. Kilvin lifted one corner of it carefully with a bandaged hand and I recognized it as the charred remains of my cloak. Kilvin shook it once, sharply, and my hand lamp tumbled free, rolling awkwardly across the table.", "\u201cWe spoke about your thieves\u2019 lamp not more than two days ago. Yet today I find it lying about where anyone of questionable character might take it for their own.\u201d He scowled at me. \u201cWhat do you have to say for yourself?\u201d", "I gaped. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Master Kilvin. I was ... They took me away ...\u201d", "He glanced at my feet, still scowling. \u201cAnd why are you unshod? Even an E\u2019lir should have better sense than to wander naked-footed in a place such as this. Your behavior lately has been quite reckless. I am dismayed.\u201d", "As I fumbled about for an explanation, Kilvin\u2019s grim expression spread into a sudden smile. \u201cI am joking with you, of course,\u201d he said gently. \u201cI owe you a great weight of thanks for pulling Re\u2019lar Fela from the fire today.\u201d He reached out to pat me on the shoulder, then thought better of it when he remembered the bandages on his hand.", "I felt my body go limp with relief. I picked up the lamp and turned it over in my hand. It didn\u2019t seem to have been damaged by the fire or corroded by the bone-tar.", "Kilvin brought out a small sack and lay it on the table as well. \u201cThese things were also in your cloak,\u201d he said. \u201cMany things. Your pockets were full as a tinker\u2019s pack.\u201d", "\u201cYou seem in a good mood, Master Kilvin,\u201d I said cautiously, wondering what painkiller he\u2019d been given at the Medica.", "\u201cI am,\u201d he said cheerfully \u201cDo you know the saying \u2018Chan Vaen edan Kote\u2019?\u201d", "I tried to puzzle it out. \u201cSeven years ... I don\u2019t know Kote.\u201d", "\u201c \u2018Expect disaster every seven years,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cIt is an old saying, and true enough. This has been two years overdue.\u201d He gestured to the wreckage of his shop with a bandaged hand. \u201cAnd now that it has come, it proves a mild disaster. My lamps were undamaged. No one was killed. Of all the small injuries, mine were the worst, as it should be.\u201d", "I eyed his bandages, my stomach clenching at the thought of something happening to his skilled artificer\u2019s hands. \u201cHow are you?\u201d I asked carefully.", "\u201cSecond-grade burns,\u201d he said, then waved away my concerned exclamation before it hardly began. \u201cJust blisters. Painful, but no charring, no long-term loss of mobility.\u201d He gave an exasperated sigh. \u201cStill, I will have a damned time getting any work done for the next three span.\u201d", "\u201cIf all you need is hands, I could lend them, Master Kilvin.\u201d", "He gave a respectful nod. \u201cThat is a generous offer, E\u2019lir. If it were merely a matter of hands I would accept. But much of my work involves sygaldry that would be ...\u201d he paused, choosing his next word carefully, \u201c... unwise for an E\u2019lir to have contact with.\u201d", "\u201cThen you should promote me to Re\u2019lar, Master Kilvin.\u201d I said with a smile. \u201cSo I might better serve you.\u201d", "He gave a deep chuckle. \u201cI may at that. If you continue your good works.\u201d", "I decided to change the subject, rather than push my luck. \u201cWhat went wrong with the canister?\u201d", "\u201cToo cold,\u201d Kilvin said. \u201cThe metal was just a shell, protecting a glass container inside and keeping the temperature low. I suspect that the canister\u2019s sygaldry was damaged so it grew colder and colder. When the reagent froze ...\u201d", "I nodded, finally understanding. \u201cIt cracked the inner glass container. Like a bottle of beer when it freezes. Then ate through the metal of the canister.\u201d", "Kilvin nodded. \u201cJaxim is currently under the weight of my displeasure,\u201d he said darkly. \u201cHe told me you brought it to his attention.\u201d", "\u201cI was sure the whole building would burn to the ground,\u201d I said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how you managed to get it under control so easily.\u201d", "\u201cEasily?\u201d he asked, sounding vaguely amused. \u201cQuickly, yes. But I did not know it was easily.\u201d", "\u201cHow did you manage it?\u201d", "He smiled at me. \u201cGood question. How do you think?\u201d", "\u201cWell, I heard one student say that you strode out of your office and called the fire\u2019s name, just like Taborlin the Great. You said, \u2018fire be still\u2019 and the fire obeyed.\u201d", "Kilvin gave a great laugh. \u201cI like that story,\u201d he said, grinning widely behind his beard. \u201cBut I have a question for you. How did you make it through the fire? The reagent produces a most intense flame. How is it you are not burned?\u201d", "\u201cI used a drench to wet myself, Master Kilvin.\u201d", "Kilvin looked thoughtful. \u201cJaxim saw you leaping through the fire just moments after the reagent spilled. The drench is quick, but not so quick as that.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m afraid I broke it, Master Kilvin. It seemed the only way\u201d", "Kilvin squinted through the window of his office, frowned, then left and walked to the other end of the shop toward the shattered drench. Kneeling down, he picked up a jagged piece of glass between his bandaged fingers. \u201cHow in all the four corners did you manage to break my drench, E\u2019lir Kvothe?\u201d", "His tone was so puzzled that I actually laughed. \u201cWell, Master Kilvin, according to the students, I staved it in with a single blow from my mighty hand.\u201d", "Kilvin grinned again. \u201cI like that story too, but I do not believe it.\u201d", "\u201cMore reputable sources claim I used a piece of bar-iron from a nearby table.\u201d", "Kilvin shook his head. \u201cYou are a fine boy, but this twice-tough glass was made by my own hands. Broad-shouldered Cammar could not break it with an anvil hammer.\u201d He dropped the piece of glass and came back to his feet. \u201cLet the others tell whatever stories they wish, but between us let us share secrets.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s no great mystery,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI know the sygaldry for twice-tough glass. What I can make, I can break.\u201d", "\u201cBut where was your source?\u201d Kilvin said. \u201cYou could have nothing ready on such short notice....\u201d I held up my bandaged thumb. \u201cBlood,\u201d he said, sounding surprised. \u201cUsing the heat of your blood could be called reckless, E\u2019lir Kvothe. What of binder\u2019s chills? What if you had gone into hypothermic shock?\u201d", "\u201cMy options were rather limited, Master Kilvin,\u201d I said.", "Kilvin nodded thoughtfully. \u201cQuite impressive, to unbind what I have wrought with nothing more than blood.\u201d He started to run a hand through his beard, then frowned in irritation when the bandages made this impossible.", "\u201cWhat of you, Master Kilvin? How did you manage to get the fire under control?\u201d", "\u201cNot using the name of fire,\u201d he conceded. \u201cIf Elodin had been here, matters would have been much simpler. But as the name of fire is unknown to me, I was left to my own devices.\u201d", "I gave him a cautious look, not sure whether he was making another joke or not. Kilvin\u2019s deadpan humor was hard to detect at times. \u201cElodin knows the name of fire?\u201d", "Kilvin nodded. \u201cThere may be one or two others here at the University, but Elodin has the surest grip of it.\u201d", "\u201cThe name of fire,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cAnd they could have called it and the fire would have done what they said, like Taborlin the Great?\u201d", "Kilvin nodded again.", "\u201cBut those are just stories,\u201d I protested.", "He gave me an amused look. \u201cWhere do you think stories come from, E\u2019lir Kvothe? Every tale has deep roots somewhere in the world.\u201d", "\u201cWhat sort of a name is it? How does it work?\u201d", "Kilvin hesitated for a moment, then shrugged his massive shoulders. \u201cIt is troublesome to explain in this language. In any language. Ask Elodin\u2014he makes a habit of studying such things.\u201d", "I knew firsthand how helpful Elodin would be. \u201cSo how did you stop the fire?\u201d", "\u201cThere is little mystery in it,\u201d he said. \u201cI was prepared for such an accident and had a small vial of the reagent in my office. I used it as a link and drew heat from the spill. The reagent grew too cold to boil and the remaining fog burned away.

I had no money to buy painkillers or new clothes. I chewed bitter willow bark and bitter was my mood.", "My poverty hung around my neck like a heavy stone. Never before had I been more aware of the difference between myself and the other students. Everyone attending the University had a safety net to fall back on. Sim\u2019s parents were Aturan nobility. Wil came from a wealthy merchant family in the Shald. If things got rough for them, they could borrow against their families\u2019 credit or write a letter home.", "I, on the other hand, couldn\u2019t afford shoes. I only owned one shirt. How could I hope to stay in the University for the years it would take me to become a full arcanist? How could I hope to advance in the ranks without access to the Archives?", "By noon, I had worked myself into such a grim mood that I snapped at Sim during lunch and we bickered like an old married couple. Wilem offered no opinion, keeping his eyes carefully on his food. Finally, in a blatant attempt to dispel my foul mood they invited me to go see Three Pennies for Wishing across the river tomorrow evening. I agreed to go, as I\u2019d heard the players were doing Feltemi\u2019s original and not one of the expurgated versions. It was well suited to my mood, full of dark humor, tragedy, and betrayal.", "After lunch I found Kilvin had already sold half my emitters. Since they were going to be the last blue emitters made for some time, the price was high, and my share was slightly over a talent and a half. I expected Kilvin might have padded the price a little, which rankled my pride a bit, but I was in no position to look a gift horse in the mouth.", "But even this did nothing to improve my mood. Now I could afford shoes and a secondhand cloak. If I worked like a dog for the remainder of the term I might be able to earn enough to eke out my interest to Devi and tuition as well. The thought brought me no joy. More than ever I was aware how tenuous my situation was. I was a hairsbreadth away from disaster.", "My mood spiraled downward and I skipped Advanced Sympathy in favor of going over the river to Imre.

It was strong and calloused, a sculptor\u2019s hand that knew hard hours of work with hammer and chisel.", "\u201cThis isn\u2019t a maiden\u2019s hand,\u201d I said.", "She looked up at me, her eyes luminous with the beginning of tears. She gave a startled laugh that was half sob. \u201cI ... what?\u201d", "I flushed with embarrassment as I realized what I\u2019d said, but pushed ahead. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the hand of some swooning princess who sits tatting lace and waiting for some prince to save her. This is the hand of a woman who would climb a rope of her own hair to freedom, or kill a captor ogre in his sleep.\u201d I looked into her eyes. \u201cAnd this is the hand of a woman who would have made it through the fire on her own if I hadn\u2019t been there. Singed perhaps, but safe.\u201d", "I brought her hand to my lips and kissed it. It seemed like the thing to do. \u201cAll the same, I am glad I was there to help.\u201d I smiled. \u201cSo ... like Tarsus?\u201d", "Her smile dazzled me again. \u201cLike Tarsus, Prince Gallant, and Oren Velciter all rolled into one,\u201d she said laughing. She gripped my hand. \u201cCome see. I have something for you.\u201d", "Fela pulled me back to the table where she\u2019d been sitting and handed me a bundle of cloth. \u201cI asked Wil and Sim what I could get you as a gift, and it seemed somehow appropriate....\u201d She paused, suddenly shy.", "It was a cloak. It was a deep forest green, rich cloth, fine cut. It hadn\u2019t been bought off the back of some fripperer\u2019s cart, either. This was the sort of clothing I could never hope to afford for myself.", "\u201cI had the tailor sew a bunch of little pockets into it,\u201d she said nervously. \u201cWil and Sim both mentioned how that was important.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s lovely,\u201d I said.", "Her smile beamed out again. \u201cI had to guess at the measurements,\u201d she admitted. \u201cLet\u2019s see if it fits.\u201d She took the cloak out of my hands and stepped close to me, spreading it over my shoulders, her arms circling me in something very near to an embrace.", "I stood there, to use Fela\u2019s words, like a scared rabbit. She was close enough that I could feel the warmth of her, and when she leaned to adjust the way the cloak lay across my shoulders, one of her breasts brushed my arm. I stood still as a statue. Over Fela\u2019s shoulder I saw Deoch grin from where he leaned in the doorway across the room.", "Fela stepped back, eyed me critically, then stepped close again and made a small adjustment to the way the cloak fastened across my chest. \u201cIt suits you,\u201d she said. \u201cThe color brings out your eyes. Not that they need it. They\u2019re the greenest thing I\u2019ve seen today. Like a piece of spring.\u201d", "As Fela stepped back to admire her handiwork, I saw a familiar shape leaving the Eolian through the front door. Denna. I only caught a brief glimpse of her profile, but I recognized her as surely as I know the backs of my own hands. What she had seen, and what conclusions she had drawn from it, I could only guess.", "My first impulse was to bolt out the door after her. To explain why I had broken our date two days ago. To say I was sorry. To make it clear that the woman with her arms around me had just been giving me a gift, nothing more.", "Fela smoothed the cloak over my shoulder and looked at me with eyes that only moments before had been luminous with the beginnings of tears.", "\u201cIt fits perfectly,\u201d I said, taking the cloth between my fingers and fanning it out to the side. \u201cIt\u2019s much better than I deserve, and you shouldn\u2019t have, but I thank you.\u201d", "\u201cI wanted to show you how much I appreciated what you did.\u201d She reached out to touch my arm again. \u201cThis is nothing, really. If there\u2019s anything I can ever do for you. Any favor. You should stop by....\u201d She paused, looking at me quizzically. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d", "I glanced past her toward the doorway. Denna could be anywhere by now. I\u2019d never be able to catch her.", "\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I lied.", "", "Fela bought me a drink and we chatted for a while about small things. I was surprised to learn that she\u2019d been working with Elodin for the last several months. She did some sculpting for him, and in exchange he occasionally tried to teach her. She rolled her eyes. He woke her in the middle of the night and took her to an abandoned quarry north of town. He put wet clay in her shoes and made her spend the entire day walking around in them. He even ... she flushed and shook her head, breaking off the story. Curious, but not wanting to make her uncomfortable, I didn\u2019t pursue it any further and we agreed between the two of us that he was more than half mad.", "All the while, I sat facing the door, vainly hoping that Denna might return and I could explain the truth of matters to her.", "Eventually Fela headed back to the University for Abstract Maths. I stayed at the Eolian, nursing a drink and trying to think how I could make things right between Denna and myself. I would have liked to have a good, maudlin drunk, but I couldn\u2019t afford it, so I made my slow, limping way back across the river as the sun was setting.", "", "It wasn\u2019t until I was getting ready to make one of my regular trips to the roof of Mains that I realized the significance of something Kilvin had said to me. If the majority of the bone-tar had gone down the grates....", "Auri. She lived in the tunnels underneath the University. I bolted to the Medica, moving as quickly as I could despite my weary, footsore state. Halfway there I had a stroke of luck and spotted Mola crossing the courtyard. I shouted and waved to get her attention.", "Mola eyed me suspiciously as I approached. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to serenade me, are you?\u201d", "I shifted my lute self-consciously and shook my head. \u201cI need a favor,\u201d I said. \u201cI have a friend that might be hurt.\u201d", "She gave a weary sigh. \u201cYou should ...\u201d", "\u201cI can\u2019t go to the Medica for help.\u201d I let my anxiety creep into my voice. \u201cPlease, Mola? I promise it won\u2019t take more than a half hour or so, but we have to go now. I\u2019m worried I might be too late already.\u201d", "Something in my tone convinced her. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with your friend?\u201d", "\u201cMaybe burns, maybe acid, maybe smoke. Like the people who were caught in the Fishery fire yesterday. Maybe worse.\u201d", "Mola started walking. \u201cI\u2019ll get my kit from my room.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll wait here if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d I took a seat on a nearby bench. \u201cI\u2019ll just slow you down.\u201d", "I sat and tried to ignore my various burns and bruises, and when Mola returned I led her to the southwestern side of Mains where there were a trio of decorative chimneys. \u201cWe can use these to get on the roof.\u201d", "She gave me a curious look but seemed content to hold onto her questions for now.", "I made my slow way up the chimney, using the protruding pieces of field-stone as hand- and footholds. This was one of the easiest ways onto the roof of Mains. I\u2019d chosen it partly because I wasn\u2019t sure of Mola\u2019s climbing ability, and partly because my own injuries had left me feeling less than athletic.", "Mola joined me on the roof. She still wore her dark uniform from the Medica, but had added a grey cloak from her room. I took a roundabout path so we could stay on the safer sections of Mains. It was a cloudless night, and there was a sliver of moon to light our way.", "\u201cIf I didn\u2019t know better,\u201d Mola said as we made our way around a tall brick chimney. \u201cI\u2019d think that you were luring me somewhere quiet for a sinister purpose.\u201d", "\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m not?\u201d I asked lightly.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t seem like the type,\u201d she said. \u201cBesides, you can barely walk. If you tried anything, I\u2019d just push you off the roof.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t spare my feelings,\u201d I said with a chuckle. \u201cEven if I weren\u2019t half-crippled, you could still throw me off this roof.\u201d", "I stumbled a little on an unseen ridge and nearly fell because my battered body was slow to respond. I sat on a piece of roof slightly higher than the rest and waited for the momentary dizziness to pass.", "\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Mola asked.", "\u201cProbably not.\u201d I pushed myself to my feet. \u201cIt\u2019s just over this next roof,\u201d I said. \u201cIt might be best if you stood back a ways and stayed quiet. Just in case.\u201d", "I made my way to the edge of the roof. I looked down at the hedges and the apple tree. The windows were dark.", "\u201cAuri?\u201d I called softly. \u201cAre you there?\u201d I waited, growing more nervous by the second. \u201cAuri, are you hurt?\u201d", "Nothing. I began to curse under my breath.", "Mola crossed her arms. \u201cRight, I think I\u2019ve been plenty patient here. Care to tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d", "\u201cFollow me and I\u2019ll explain.\u201d I headed for the apple tree and began to climb carefully down. I walked around the hedge to the iron grate. The ammonia smell of bone-tar wafted up from the grate, faint but persistent. I tugged on the grate, and it lifted a few inches before catching on something. \u201cI made a friend a few months ago,\u201d I said, nervously sliding my hand between the bars. \u201cShe lives down here. I\u2019m worried that she might be hurt. A lot of the reagent went down the drains from the Fishery.\u201d", "Mola was silent for a while. \u201cYou\u2019re serious.\u201d I felt around in the dark under the grate, trying to figure out how Auri kept it closed. \u201cWhat sort of person would live down there?\u201d", "\u201cA frightened person,\u201d I said. \u201cA person who\u2019s afraid of loud noises, and people, and the open sky. It took me nearly a month to coax her out of the tunnels, let alone get close enough to talk.\u201d", "Mola sighed. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind I\u2019ll have a seat.\u201d She walked over to the bench. \u201cI\u2019ve been on my feet all day.\u201d", "I continued to feel around under the grate, but try as I might, I couldn\u2019t find a clasp anywhere. Growing increasingly frustrated, I grabbed the grate and tugged on it hard, again and again. It made several echoing metallic thumps but didn\u2019t come free.", "\u201cKvothe?\u201d I looked up to the edge of the roof and saw Auri standing there, a silhouette against the night sky, her fine hair made a cloud around her head.", "\u201cAuri!\u201dThe tension poured out of me, leaving me feeling weak and rubbery. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d", "\u201cThere were clouds,\u201d she said simply as she walked around the edge of the roof toward the apple tree. \u201cSo I went looking for you on top of things. But the moon\u2019s coming out, so I came back.\u201d", "Auri scampered down the tree, then pulled up short when she saw Mola\u2019s cloaked form sitting on the bench.", "\u201cI brought a friend to visit, Auri,\u201d I said in my gentlest tones. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d", "There was a long pause. \u201cIs he nice?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s a she. And yes, she\u2019s nice.\u201d", "Auri relaxed a bit and came a few steps closer to me. \u201cI brought you a feather with the spring wind in it, but since you were late ...\u201d she looked at me gravely, \u201cyou get a coin instead.\u201d She held it out at arm\u2019s length, pinched between her thumb and forefinger. \u201cIt will keep you safe at night. As much as anything can, that is.\u201d It was shaped like an Aturan penance piece, but it gleamed silver in the moonlight. I\u2019d never seen a coin like it.", "Kneeling, I opened my lute case and brought out a small bundle. \u201cI\u2019ve got some tomatoes, beans, and something special.\u201d I held out the small sack I\u2019d spent most of my money on two days ago, before all my troubles had started. \u201cSea salt.\u201d", "Auri took it, and peered inside the small leather sack. \u201cWhy this is lovely, Kvothe. What lives in the salt?\u201d", "Trace minerals, I thought. Chromium, bassal, malium, iodine ... everything your body needs but probably can\u2019t get from apples and bread and whatever you manage to scrounge up when I can\u2019t find you.", "\u201cThe dreams of fish,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd sailor\u2019s songs.\u201d", "Auri nodded, satisfied, and sat down, spreading out the small cloth and arranging her food with the same care as always. I watched her as she began to eat, dipping a green bean into the salt before taking a bite. She didn\u2019t seem hurt, but it was hard to tell by the pale moonlight. I needed to be sure. \u201cAre you okay, Auri?\u201d", "She cocked her head at me, curious.", "\u201cThere was a big fire. A lot of it went down the grates. Did you see it?\u201d", "\u201cHoly God, yes,\u201d she said, her eyes wide. \u201cIt was all over, and all the shrews and raccoons were running everyway, trying to get out.\u201d", "\u201cDid any of it get on you?\u201d I asked. \u201cDid you get burned?\u201d", "She shook her head, grinning a child\u2019s sly smile. \u201cOh no. It couldn\u2019t catch me.\u201d", "\u201cWere you close to the fire?\u201d I asked. \u201cDid you breathe any of the smoke?\u201d", "\u201cWhy would I breathe smoke?\u201d Auri looked at me as if I were simple. \u201cThe whole Underthing smells like cat piss now.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cExcept by Downing and in the Belows.\u201d", "I relaxed a bit, but I saw Mola begin to fidget where she was sitting on the bench. \u201cAuri, can my friend come over?\u201d", "Auri froze with a bean halfway to her mouth, then relaxed and bobbed her head once, sending her fine hair swirling around her.", "I beckoned to Mola who began to walk slowly toward us. I was a little uneasy at how their meeting would go. It had taken me over a month of gentle coaxing to draw Auri out from the tunnels underneath the University where she lived. I worried that a bad reaction from Mola might startle her back underground where I would have no chance of finding her.", "I gestured to where Mola stood. \u201cThis is my friend Mola.\u201d", "\u201cHello, Mola.\u201d Auri looked up and smiled. \u201cYou have sunny hair like me. Would you like an apple?\u201d", "Mola\u2019s expression was carefully blank. \u201cThank you, Auri. I\u2019d like that.\u201d", "Auri jumped up and ran back to where the apple tree overhung the edge of the roof. Then ran back toward us, her hair flying behind her like a flag. She handed Mola an apple. \u201cThis one has a wish inside it,\u201d she said matter-of-factly. \u201cMake sure you know what you want before you take a bite.\u201d That said, she settled back down and ate another bean, chewing primly.", "Mola looked over the apple for a long moment before taking a bite.", "Auri finished her meal quickly after that, and tied up the bag of salt. \u201cNow play!\u201d she said, excited. \u201cPlay!\u201d", "Smiling, I brought out my lute and brushed my hands over the strings. Thankfully my injured thumb was on my chording hand, where it would be a relatively minor inconvenience.", "I looked at Mola as I tuned the strings. \u201cYou can go if you like,\u201d I told her. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to accidentally serenade you.\u201d", "\u201cOh you musn\u2019t go.\u201d Auri turned to Mola, her expression deathly serious. \u201cHis voice is like a thunderstorm, and his hands know every secret hidden deep beneath the cool, dark earth.\u201d", "Mola\u2019s mouth quirked into a smile. \u201cI suppose I could stay for that.\u201d", "So I played for both of them, while overhead the stars continued in their measured turning.", "", "\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you told anyone?\u201d Mola asked me as we made our way across the rooftops.", "\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem like anyone\u2019s business,\u201d I said. \u201cIf she wanted people to know she was there, I imagine she\u2019d tell them herself.\u201d", "\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d Mola said, irritated.", "\u201cI know what you mean,\u201d I sighed. \u201cBut what good would come of it?

If you just told someone ...\u201d", "\u201cRight,\u201d I said sarcastically. \u201cI\u2019m sure Jamison would rush out here with a box of chocolates and a featherbed if he knew there was a starveling half-cracked student living under his University.

I hoped to turn a tidy profit.", "It may seem odd that I was constantly buying materials for my artificing over the river, but the truth was merchants near the University frequently took advantage of the students\u2019 laziness and raised their prices. It was worth the walk for me if I could save a couple of pennies.", "After I finished my errand I headed to the Eolian. Deoch was at his usual post, leaning against the doorway. \u201cI\u2019ve been keeping an eye out for your girl,\u201d he said.", "Irritated at how transparent I must seem, I muttered, \u201cShe\u2019s not my girl.\u201d", "Deoch rolled his eyes. \u201cFine.

It\u2019s like if you look at a great oak tree. You don\u2019t appreciate it because it\u2019s older than the other trees, or because it\u2019s taller. It just has something that other younger trees don\u2019t. Complexity, solidity, significance.\u201d Deoch scowled, irritated. \u201cDamn if that isn\u2019t the worst comparison I\u2019ve ever made.\u201d", "A smile broke onto my face. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see I\u2019m not the only one who has trouble pinning her down with words.\u201d", "\u201cShe\u2019s not much for being pinned down,\u201d Deoch agreed and drank off the rest of his wine.

Just as pretty, prone to startle the eye and stutter the heart.\u201d He shrugged again. \u201cAs I said, largely the same. Lovely voice, light of foot, quick of tongue, men\u2019s adoration and women\u2019s scorn in roughly equal amounts.\u201d", "\u201cScorn?\u201d I asked.", "Deoch looked at me as if he didn\u2019t understand what I was asking. \u201cWomen hate Denna,\u201d he said plainly, as if repeating something we both already knew.", "\u201cHate her?\u201d The thought baffled me. \u201cWhy?\u201d", "Deoch looked at me incredulously, then burst out laughing. \u201cGood lord, you really don\u2019t know anything about women, do you?\u201d I would ordinarily have bristled at his comment, but Deoch was nothing but good natured. \u201cThink of it. She\u2019s pretty and charming. Men crowd round her like stags in rut.\u201d He made a flippant gesture. \u201cWomen are bound to resent it.\u201d", "I remembered what Sim had said about Deoch not a span ago. He\u2019s managed to get the most beautiful woman in the place again. It\u2019s enough to make you hate a man. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt she was rather lonely,\u201d I volunteered. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why.\u201d", "Deoch nodded solemnly. \u201cThere\u2019s truth to that. I never see her in the company of other womenfolk, and she has about as much luck with men as ...\u201d He paused, groping for a comparison. \u201cAs ... damn.\u201d He gave a frustrated sigh.", "\u201cWell, you know what they say: Finding the right analogy is as hard as ...\u201d I put on a thoughtful expression. \u201cAs hard as ...\u201d I made an inarticulate grasping gesture.", "Deoch laughed and poured more wine for both of us. I began to relax. There is a sort of camaraderie that rarely exists except between men who have fought the same enemies and known the same women. \u201cDid she tend to disappear back then, too?\u201d I asked.", "He nodded. \u201cNo warning, just suddenly gone. Sometimes for a span. Sometimes for months.\u201d", "\u201c \u2018No fickleness in flight like that of wind or women\u2019s fancy,\u2019 \u201d I quoted. I meant it to be musing, but it came out bitter. \u201cDo you have any guess as to why?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve given some thought to that,\u201d Deoch said philosophically. \u201cIn part I think it is her nature. It could be she simply has wandering blood.\u201d", "My irritation cooled a bit at his words. Back in my troupe, my father occasionally made us pull up stakes and leave a town despite the fact that we were welcome and the crowds were generous. Later, he would often explain his reasoning to me: a glare from the constable, too many fond sighs from the young wives in town....", "But sometimes he had no reason. We Ruh are meant to travel, son. When my blood tells me to wander, I know enough to trust it.", "\u201cHer circumstances are probably responsible for most of it,\u201d Deoch continued.", "\u201cCircumstances?\u201d I asked, curious. She never talked of her past when we were together, and I was always careful not to press her. I knew what it was like, not wanting to talk too much about your past.", "\u201cWell, she doesn\u2019t have any family or means of support. No long-standing friends able to help her out of a tight spot if the need arises.\u201d", "\u201cI haven\u2019t got any of those things either,\u201d I groused, the wine making me a little surly.", "\u201cThere\u2019s more than a little difference there,\u201d Deoch said with a hint of reproach. \u201cA man has a great many opportunities to make his way in the world. You\u2019ve found yourself a place at the University, and if you hadn\u2019t you would still have options.\u201d He looked at me with a knowing eye. \u201cWhat options are available to a young, pretty girl with no family? No dowry? No home?\u201d", "He began to hold up fingers. \u201cThere\u2019s begging and whoring. Or being some lord\u2019s mistress, which is a different slice of the same loaf. And we know our Denna doesn\u2019t have it in her to be a kept woman or someone\u2019s dox.\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s other work to be had,\u201d I said holding up fingers of my own. \u201cSeamstress, weaver, serving girl ...\u201d", "Deoch snorted and gave me a disgusted look. \u201cCome now lad, you\u2019re smarter than that. You know what those places are like. And you know that a pretty girl with no family ends up being taken advantage of just as often as a whore, and paid less for her trouble.\u201d", "I flushed a bit at his rebuke, more than I would have normally, as I was feeling the wine. It was making my lips and the tips of my fingers a little numb.", "Deoch filled our glasses again. \u201cShe\u2019s not to be looked down on for moving where the wind blows her. She has to take her opportunities where she finds them. If she gets the chance to travel with some folk who like her singing, or with a merchant who hopes her pretty face will help him sell his wares, who\u2019s to blame her for pulling up stakes and leaving town?", "\u201cAnd if she trades on her charm a bit, I\u2019ll not look down on her because of it. Young gents court her, buy her presents, dresses, jewelry.\u201d He shrugged his broad shoulders. \u201cIf she sells those things for money to live, there\u2019s nothing wrong in that. They are gifts freely given, and hers to do with as she pleases.\u201d", "Deoch fixed me with a stare. \u201cBut what is she to do when some gent gets too familiar? Or gets angry at being denied what he considers bought and paid for? What recourse does she have? No family, no friends, no standing. No choice. None but to give herself over to him, all unwilling....\u201d Deoch\u2019s face was grim. \u201cOr to leave. Leave quickly and find better weather. Is it any surprise then that she is harder to lay hands on than a windblown leaf?\u201d", "He shook his head, looking down at the table. \u201cNo, I do not envy her her life. Nor do I judge her.\u201d His tirade seemed to have left him spent and slightly embarrassed. He didn\u2019t look up at me as he spoke. \u201cFor all that, I would help her, if she would let me.\u201d He glanced up at me and gave a chagrined smile. \u201cBut she\u2019s not the sort to be beholden to anyone. Not one whit. Not a hairsbreadth.\u201d He sighed and dribbled the last drops of the bottle evenly into our glasses.", "\u201cYou\u2019ve shown her to me in a new light,\u201d I said honestly. \u201cI\u2019m ashamed I didn\u2019t see it for myself.\u201d", "\u201cWell, I\u2019ve had a head start on you,\u201d he said easily. \u201cI\u2019ve known her longer.\u201d", "\u201cNevertheless, I thank you,\u201d I said holding up my glass.", "He held up his own. \u201cTo Dyanae,\u201d he said. \u201cMost lovely.\u201d", "\u201cTo Denna, full of delight.\u201d", "\u201cYoung and unbending.\u201d", "\u201cBright and fair.\u201d", "\u201cEver sought, ever alone.\u201d", "\u201cSo wise and so foolish,\u201d I said. \u201cSo merry and so sad.\u201d", "\u201cGods of my fathers,\u201d Deoch said reverently \u201cKeep her always so: unchanging, past my understanding, and safe from harm.\u201d", "We both drank and set down our glasses.", "\u201cLet me buy the next bottle,\u201d I said. It would tap out my slowly hoarded line of credit with the bar, but I found myself increasingly fond of Deoch and the thought of not standing my round with him was too galling to consider.", "\u201cStream, stone, and sky,\u201d he swore, rubbing at his face. \u201cI dare not. Another bottle and we\u2019d be slitting our wrists into the river before the sun goes down.\u201d", "I made a gesture to a serving girl. \u201cNonsense,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just change to something less maudlin than wine.\u201d", "", "I didn\u2019t notice I was being followed when I returned to the University. Perhaps my head was so full of Denna that there was little room left for anything else. Perhaps I had been living civilized for so long that the hard-earned reflexes I\u2019d picked up in Tarbean were starting to fade.", "The blackberry brand probably had something to do with it as well. Deoch and I had talked for a long while, and between us drank half a bottle of the stuff. I had brought the remainder of the bottle back with me, as I knew Simmon had a taste for it.", "Small matter why I didn\u2019t notice them, I suppose. The result was the same. I was strolling down a poorly lit part of Newhall Lane when something blunt struck me on the back of the head and I was bundled off into a nearby alley, half-senseless.", "I was only stunned for a moment, but by the time I had re-gathered my wits, I had a heavy hand clamped over my mouth.", "\u201cAlright, cully,\u201d the huge man behind me spoke into my ear. \u201cI\u2019ve got a knife on you. You struggle, I stick you. That\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d I felt a gentle prod against my ribs under my left arm. \u201cCheck the finder,\u201d he said to his companion.", "A tall shape was all I could see in the dim light of the alley. He bowed his head, looking at his hand. \u201cI can\u2019t tell.\u201d", "\u201cLight a match, then. We have to be sure.\u201d", "My anxiety began to blossom into full-blown panic. This wasn\u2019t some simple back-alley coshing. They hadn\u2019t even checked my pockets for money. This was something else.", "\u201cWe know it\u2019s him,\u201d the tall one said impatiently. \u201cLet\u2019s just do this and have it over with. I\u2019m cold.\u201d", "\u201cLike hell. Check it now, while he\u2019s close. We\u2019ve lost him twice already. I\u2019m not having another cock-up like in Anilin.\u201d", "\u201cI hate this thing,\u201d the tall man said as he went through his pockets, presumably looking for a match.", "\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d the one behind me said. \u201cIt\u2019s cleaner this way. Simpler. No confusing descriptions. No names. No worrying about disguises. Follow the needle, find our man, and have done with it.\u201d", "The matter-of-fact tone of their voices terrified me. These men were professionals. I realized with sudden certainty that Ambrose had finally taken steps to ensure I would never bother him again.", "My mind raced for a moment, and I did the only thing I could think of: I dropped the half-full bottle of brand. It shattered on the cobblestones and the night air was suddenly filled with the smell of blackberries.", "\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d the tall man hissed. \u201cHow about you let him ring a bell while you\u2019re at it?\u201d", "The man behind me tightened his grip on my neck and shook me hard, just once. The same way you would do to a naughty puppy \u201cNone of that,\u201d he said, irritated.", "I went limp, hoping to lull him, then concentrated and muttered a binding against the man\u2019s thick hand.", "\u201cTough tits,\u201d the man replied. \u201cIf you stepped in glass it\u2019s your own damn faaaaaah!\u201d He let out a startled shout as the pool of brand around our feet caught fire.", "I took advantage of his momentary distraction and twisted away from him. But I wasn\u2019t quite quick enough. His knife tore a bright line of pain across my ribs as I pulled away and began pelting down the alley.", "But my flight was short-lived. The alley dead-ended against a sheer brick wall. There were no doors, no windows, nothing to hide behind or use to get a leg up on the wall. I was trapped.", "I turned to see the two men blocking the mouth of the alley. The large one was stamping his leg furiously, trying to extinguish it.", "My left leg was burning as well, but I didn\u2019t spare a thought for it. A little burn would be the least of my problems if I didn\u2019t do something quick. I looked around again, but the alley was distressingly clean. Not even any decent garbage to use as a makeshift weapon. I frantically ran through the contents of my cloak\u2019s pockets, desperately trying to form some sort of plan. Some pieces of copper wire were useless. Salt, could I throw it in their eyes? No. Dried apple, pen and ink, a marble, string, wax ...", "The large man finally beat out the flames and the two of them began to make their slow way down the alley. The light from the circle of burning brand flickered across the blades of their knives.", "Still going over my countless pockets, I found a lump that I didn\u2019t recognize. Then I remembered\u2014it was the a sack of bassal shavings I had bought to use for my sympathy lamp.", "Bassal is a light, silvery metal, useful in certain alloys that I would be using to construct my lamp. Manet, ever the careful teacher, had taken care to describe the dangers of every material we used. If it gets hot enough, bassal burns with an intense, white-hot flame.", "I hurriedly untied the pouch. The trouble was, I didn\u2019t know if I could make this work. Things like candle wicking or alcohol are easy to light. They just need a focused flash of heat to get them going. Bassal was different. It needed a great deal of heat to ignite, which is why I wasn\u2019t worried about carrying it around in my pocket.", "The men came a few slow steps closer and I flung the handful of bassal shavings in a wide arc. I tried to get it close to their faces, but didn\u2019t hold much hope. The shavings had no real heft, it was like throwing a handful of loose snow.", "Lowering one hand to the flame licking at my leg, I focused my Alar. The wide pool of burning brand winked out behind the two men, leaving the alley in pitch darkness. But there still wasn\u2019t enough heat. Reckless with desperation, I touched my bloody side, concentrated, and felt a terrible cold tear through me as I pulled more heat from my blood.", "There was an explosion of white light, blinding in the dark of the alley. I\u2019d closed my eyes, but even through my lids the burning bassal was piercingly bright. One of the men screamed, high and terrified. When I opened my eyes I could see nothing but blue ghosts dancing over my vision.", "The scream faded to a low moaning, and I heard a thump as if one of the men had stumbled and fallen. The tall man began to babble, his voice little more than a terrified sobbing. \u201cOh God. Tarn, my eyes. I\u2019m blind.\u201d", "As I listened, my vision cleared enough for me to see the vague outlines of the alley I could see the dark shapes of both men. One was kneeling with his hands in front of his face, the other was sprawled motionless on the ground farther down the alley. It looked like he had run headlong into a low rafter beam at the mouth of the alley and knocked himself unconscious. Scattered around the cobblestones, the remnants of bassal were sputtering out like tiny blue-white stars.", "The kneeling man was only flash-blind, but it would last for several minutes: long enough for me to get well away from here. I moved slowly around him, being careful to step quietly My heart leapt into to my throat as he spoke up again.", "\u201cTarn?\u201d The man\u2019s voice was high and frightened. \u201cI swear Tarn, I\u2019m blind. The kid called down lightning on me.\u201d I saw him go down on to all fours and begin to feel around with his hands. \u201cYou were right, we shouldn\u2019ta come here. No good comes of meddling with these sort of folk.\u201d", "Lightning. Of course. He didn\u2019t know a thing about real magic. It gave me a thought.", "I took a deep breath, settling my nerves. \u201cWho sent you?\u201d I demanded in my best Taborlin the Great voice. It wasn\u2019t as good as my father\u2019s, but it was good.", "The big man gave a wretched moan and stopped feeling around with his hands. \u201cOh sir. Don\u2019t do anything that\u2014\u201d", "\u201cI am not asking again.\u201d I cut him off angrily \u201cTell me who sent you. And if you lie to me, I\u2019ll know.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know a name,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cWe just get half the coin and a hair. We don\u2019t know names. We don\u2019t actually meet. I swear ...\u201d", "A hair. The thing they had called a \u201cfinder\u201d was probably some sort of dowsing compass. Though I couldn\u2019t make anything that advanced, I knew the principles involved. With a piece of my hair, it would point toward me no matter where I ran.", "\u201cIf I ever see either of you again, I will call down worse than fire and lightning,\u201d I said menacingly as I edged toward the mouth of the alley. If I could get hold of their finder I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about them tracking me down again. It had been dark and the hood of my cloak had been up. They might not even know what I looked like.", "\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d he babbled. \u201cI swear you won\u2019t see hide or hair of us after this. Thank you ...\u201d", "I looked down at the fallen man. I could see one of his pale hands against the cobblestones, but it was empty. I looked around, wondering if he had dropped it. It was more likely that he\u2019d tucked it away. I moved closer still, holding my breath. I reached into his cloak, feeling for pockets, but his cloak was pinned under his body. I took gentle hold of his shoulder and eased him slowly ...", "Just then, he let out a low moan and rolled the rest of the way onto his back under his own power. His arm flopped loosely onto the cobbles, bumping my leg.", "I would like to say I simply took a step away, knowing that the tall man would be groggy and still half-blind. I\u2019d like to tell you I remained calm and did my best to intimidate them further, or at the very least that I said something dramatic or witty before I left.", "But that would not be the truth. The truth was, I ran like a frightened deer. I made it nearly a quarter mile before the darkness and my dazzled vision betrayed me and I ran headlong into a horse tether, crumpling to the ground in a painful heap. Bruised, bleeding, and half-blind, I lay there. Only then did I realize I wasn\u2019t being chased at all.", "I dragged myself to my feet, cursing myself for a fool. If I\u2019d kept my wits about me, I could have taken their dowsing compass away, ensuring my safety. As it was, I\u2019d have to take other precautions.", "I made my way back to Anker\u2019s, but when I arrived all the inn\u2019s windows were dark and the door was locked. So, half drunk and wounded I made my way up to my window, tripped the latch and tugged ... but it wouldn\u2019t open.", "It had been at least a span of days since I\u2019d come back to the inn so late that I\u2019d been forced to use my window route. Had the hinges rusted?", "Bracing myself against the wall, I drew out my hand lamp and thumbed it on to its dimmest setting. Only then did I see something lodged firmly into the crack of the windowframe. Had Anker\u2019s wedged my window shut?", "But when I touched it, I realized it wasn\u2019t wood. It was a piece of paper, much folded over. I tugged it free and the window came open easily. I clambered inside.", "My shirt was ruined, but when I stripped it off I was relieved by what I saw. The cut wasn\u2019t particularly deep\u2014painful and messy, but less serious than when I\u2019d been whipped. Fela\u2019s cloak was torn too, which was irritating. But, everything said, it would be easier to patch that than my kidney. I made a mental note to thank Fela for choosing a nice, thick fabric.", "Stitching it up could wait. For all I knew the two men had recovered from the little scare I\u2019d given them and were already dowsing for me again.", "I left through the window, leaving my cloak behind so as not to get any blood on it. I hoped the lateness of the hour and my natural stealth would keep me from being seen. I couldn\u2019t begin to guess what rumors would start if someone saw me running across the rooftops late at night, bloody and naked to the waist.", "I gathered up a handful of leaves as I made my way to the roof of a livery overlooking the pennant courtyard near the Archives.", "In the dim moonlight I could see the dark, shapeless shadows of leaves swirling over the grey of the cobblestones below. I ran my hand roughly through my hair, ending up with a few loose strands. Then I dug at a seam of tar on the roof with my fingernails and used some to stick the hair to a leaf. I repeated this a dozen times, dropping the leaves off the roof, watching as the wind took them away in a mad dance back and forth across the courtyard.", "I smiled at the thought of anyone trying to dowse for me now, trying to make sense of the dozens of contradictory signals as the leaves swirled and spun in a dozen different directions.", "I\u2019d come to this particular courtyard because the wind moved oddly here. I\u2019d only noticed it after the autumn leaves began to fall. They moved in a complex, chaotic dance across the cobblestones. First one way, then another, never falling into a predictable pattern.", "Once you noticed the wind\u2019s odd swirlings, it was hard to ignore. In fact, viewed from the roof like this, it was almost hypnotic. The same way flowing water or a campfire\u2019s flames can catch your eye and hold it.", "Watching it tonight, weary and wounded, it was rather relaxing. The more I watched it, the less chaotic it seemed. In fact, I began to sense a greater underlying pattern to the way the wind moved through the courtyard. It only looked chaotic because it was vastly, marvelously complex. What\u2019s more, it seemed to be always changing. It was a pattern made of changing patterns. It was\u2014", "\u201cYou\u2019re up studying awfully late,\u201d said a quiet voice from behind me.", "Startled out of my reverie, my body tensed, ready to bolt. How had someone managed to get up here without my noticing?", "It was Elodin. Master Elodin. He was dressed in a patched set of pants and a loose shirt. He waved idly in my direction and crouched down to sit cross-legged on the edge of the roof as casually as if we were meeting for a drink in a pub.", "He looked down into the courtyard. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly good tonight, isn\u2019t it?\u201d", "I folded my arms, ineffectually trying to cover my bare, bloody chest. Only then did I notice the blood on my hands was dry. How long had I been sitting here, motionless, watching the wind?", "\u201cMaster Elodin,\u201d I said, then stopped. I had no idea what I could possibly say in a situation like this.", "\u201cPlease, we\u2019re all friends here. Feel free to call me by my first name: Master.\u201d He gave a lazy grin and looked back down toward the courtyard.", "Hadn\u2019t he noticed the state I was in? Was he being polite? Maybe ... I shook my head. There was no use guessing with him. I knew better than anyone that Elodin was cracked as the potter\u2019s cobbles.", "\u201cLong ago,\u201d Elodin said conversationally, not taking his eyes from the courtyard below. \u201cWhen folk spoke differently, this used to be called the Quoyan Hayel. Later they called it the Questioning Hall, and students made a game of writing questions on slips of paper and letting them blow about. Rumor had it you could divine your answer by which way the paper left the square.\u201d He pointed to the roads that left gaps between the grey buildings. \u201cYes. No. Maybe. Elsewhere. Soon.\u201d", "He shrugged. \u201cIt was all a mistake though. Bad translation. They thought Quoyan was an early root of quetentan: question. But it isn\u2019t. Quoyan means \u2018wind.\u2019 This is rightly named \u2018the House of the Wind.\u2019 \u201d", "I waited a moment to see if he intended to say any more. When nothing was forthcoming I got slowly to my feet. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting, Master ...\u201d I hesitated, not sure how serious he had been before. \u201cBut I should be going.\u201d", "Elodin nodded absently and gave a wave that was half farewell, half dismissal. His eyes never left the courtyard below, following the ever-changing wind.", "", "Back in my room at Anker\u2019s, I sat on my bed for a long minute in the dark, trying to decide what to do. My thoughts were muddy. I was weary, wounded, and still a little drunk. The adrenaline that had kept me going earlier was slowly turning sour and my side burned and stung.", "I took a deep breath and tried to focus my thoughts. I\u2019d been moving on instinct so far, but now I needed to think things through carefully.", "Could I go to the masters for help? For a moment hope rose in my chest, then fell. No. I had no proof that Ambrose was responsible. What\u2019s more, if I told them the whole story, I would have to admit that I had used sympathy to blind and burn my attackers. Self-defense or no, what I\u2019d done was unquestionably malfeasance. Students had been expelled for less than that just to preserve the University\u2019s reputation.", "No. I couldn\u2019t risk being expelled over this. And if I went to the Medica, there would be too many questions. And word of my injury would get around if I went in to get stitched. That meant Ambrose would know how close he had come to succeeding. It would be better to give the impression that I had walked away unscathed.", "I had no idea how long Ambrose\u2019s hired killers had been following me. One of them had said, \u201cWe already lost him twice.\u201d That means they could know I had a room here at Anker\u2019s. I might not be safe here.", "I locked the window and drew the curtain before turning on my hand lamp. The light revealed the forgotten piece of paper that had been wedged into my window. I unfolded it and read:", "Kvothe,", "Getting up here is every bit as much fun as you made it look. However, springing your window took some time. Finding you not at home, I hope you do not mind me borrowing paper and ink enough to leave this note. As you are not playing downstairs, or peacefully abed, a cynical person might wonder what you are doing at this late hour, and if you are up to no good. Alas, I shall have to walk back home tonight without the comfort of your escort or the pleasure of your company.", "I missed you this Felling past at the Eolian, but though denied your company, I had the good fortune to meet someone quite interesting. He is a quite singular fellow, and I am eager to tell you what little I can of him. When next we meet.", "I currently have rooms at the Swan and Swale (Swail?) in Imre. Please call on me, before the 23rd of this month, and we will have our lunch, belated. After that I will be about on my business.", "Your friend and apprentice housebreaker,", "Denna,", "pstscrpt\u2014Please rest assured that I did not notice the disgraceful condition of your bed linens, and did not judge your character thereby.", "", "Today was the 28th. The letter didn\u2019t have a date, but it had probably been there for at least a span and a half. She must have left it only a few days after the fire in the Fishery.", "I briefly tried to decide how I felt about it. Flattered that she had tried to find me? Furious that the note had gone unfound until now?

You would not pick a wife in ten minutes, and on the road, a horse is more important than a wife.\u201d He gave a bashful smile. \u201cEven God himself didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d", "I cut him off yet again. \u201cGod\u2019s not buying a horse today, I am.\u201d", "The thin Cealdish man paused to collect his thoughts. \u201cRight,\u201d he said softly, more to himself than to me. \u201cLhin, come around and see what we have.\u201d", "He led me around the outside of the stables to a small corral. He gestured near the edge of the fence. \u201cThat dapple mare is as steady a horse as any you could hope for. She\u2019ll take you....\u201d", "I ignored him and looked over the half-dozen hacks that stood idly inside the fence. Though I had neither means nor reason to keep a horse, I knew good from bad, and nothing I saw here came close to suiting my needs.", "You see, troupers live and die by the horses that pull their wagons, and my parents had not neglected my education in this area. I could size up a horse by the time I was eight, and a good thing too. Townsfolk regularly tried to pass off half-dead or gingered up nags to us, knowing that by the time we discovered our mistakes we\u2019d be miles and days away. There was a world of trouble waiting for a man who sold his neighbor some sickly hobble, but what was the harm of swindling one of the filthy, thieving Ruh?", "I turned to face the cavler, frowning. \u201cYou have just wasted two precious minutes of my time, so I\u2019m guessing you still don\u2019t understand my position here. Let me be as plain as possible. I want a fast horse ready for hard riding today. For this I will pay quickly, in hard coin, and without complaint.\u201d I held up my newly heavy purse in one hand and shook it, knowing he could tell the ring of true Cealdish silver inside.", "\u201cIf you sell me a horse that throws a shoe, or starts to limp, or spooks at shadows, I will miss a valuable opportunity. A quite unrecoverable opportunity. If that happens, I will not come back and demand a refund. I will not petition the constable. I will walk back to Imre this very night and set fire to your house. Then, when you run out the front door in your nightshirt and stockle-cap, I will kill you, cook you, and eat you. Right there on your lawn while all your neighbors watch.\u201d", "I gave him a deadly serious look. \u201cThis is the business arrangement I am proposing, Kaerva. If you are not comfortable with it, tell me and I will go elsewhere. Otherwise, leave off this parade of drays and show me a real horse.\u201d", "The short Ceald looked at me, more stunned than horrified. I could see him trying to come to grips with the situation. He must think I was either a raving lunatic, or the son of some important noble. Or both.", "\u201cVery well,\u201d he said, letting all the ingratiating charm fall from his voice. \u201cWhen you say hard riding, how hard do you mean?\u201d", "\u201cVery hard,\u201d I said. \u201cI need to go seventy miles today Dirt roads.\u201d", "\u201cWill you need saddle and tack too?\u201d", "I nodded. \u201cNothing fancy. Nothing new.\u201d", "He drew a deep breath. \u201cFine, and how much do you have to spend?\u201d", "I shook my head and gave a tight smile. \u201cShow me the horse and name your price. A Vaulder would do nicely. If he\u2019s a little wild, I won\u2019t mind if it means he\u2019s got energy to spare. Even a good Vaulder mix could serve me, or a Khershaen forth horse.\u201d", "Kaerva nodded and led me back toward the wide doors of the stable. \u201cI do have a Khershaen. A full-blood actually.\u201d He made a gesture to one of the stablehands. \u201cBring out our black gentleman, double-quick.\u201d The boy sprinted off.", "The cavler turned back to me. \u201cGorgeous animal. I ran him through the traces before I bought him, just to be sure. Galloped him a full mile and he hardly even worked up a sweat, smooth a gait as ever I\u2019ve felt, and I\u2019d not lie to your lordship on that account.\u201d", "I nodded, a full-blooded Khershaen was exactly suited to my purpose. They had a legendary endurance, but there would be no avoiding the price, either. A well-trained forth horse was worth a dozen talents. \u201cHow much are you asking for him?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll want two solid marks,\u201d he said without any hint of apology or wheedling in his voice.", "Merciful Tehlu, twenty talents. He\u2019d have to have silver shoes to be worth that much. \u201cI\u2019m in no mood for a lengthy dicker, Kaerva,\u201d I said shortly.", "\u201cYou\u2019ve made me well aware of that, milord,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m telling you my honest price. Here. You\u2019ll see why.\u201d", "The boy hurried out leading a sleek monster of a horse. At least eighteen hands tall, proud head, and black from his nose to the tip of his tail. \u201cHe loves to run,\u201d Kaerva said with genuine affection in his voice. He ran a hand along the smooth black neck. \u201cAnd look at that color. Not so much as a pale whisker, that\u2019s why he\u2019s worth twenty if he\u2019s worth a single shim.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t care about the color,\u201d I said absentmindedly while I looked him over for signs of injury or old age. There was nothing. He was glossy, young, strong. \u201cI just need to move quickly.\u201d", "\u201cI understand,\u201d he said apologetically. \u201cBut I can\u2019t just ignore the coloring. If I wait a span or two, some young lord will pay just for the snappy look of him.\u201d", "I knew it was true. \u201cDoes he have a name?\u201d I asked moving slowly toward the black horse, letting him smell my hands and get used to me. Bargaining can be hurried, but befriending a horse cannot. Only a fool rushes first impressions with a spirited young Khershaen.", "\u201cNot one that\u2019s stuck on him,\u201d he said.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, boy?\u201d I asked gently, just so he could get used to the sound of my voice. He snuffed delicately at my hand, keeping close watch with one large, intelligent eye. He didn\u2019t back away, but he certainly wasn\u2019t at his ease either. I kept talking as I came closer, hoping he would relax at the sound of my voice. \u201cYou deserve a good name. I hate to see some lordling with delusions of wit saddle you with some terrible name like Midnight or Sooty or Scut.\u201d", "I came closer and lay one hand along his neck. His skin twitched, but he didn\u2019t pull away. I needed to be sure of his temperament as much as his stamina. I couldn\u2019t take the risk of jumping on the back of a skittish horse. \u201cSomeone half clever might dub you Pitch or Scuttle, ill-favored names. Or Slate, a sedentary name. Heaven forbid you end up Blackie, that\u2019s an ill-fitting name for a prince like you.\u201d", "My father always talked to new horses in this way, in a steady calming litany. As I stroked his neck, I kept speaking without giving any mind to what I said. Words don\u2019t matter to the horse, the tone of your voice is the important thing. \u201cYou\u2019ve come a long way. You should have a proud name, so folk won\u2019t think of you as common. Was your previous owner Cealdish?\u201d I asked. \u201cVe vanaloi. Tu teriam keta. Palan te?\u201d", "I could sense him relax a bit at the sound of the familiar language. I walked onto his other side, still looking him over carefully and letting him get used to my presence. \u201cTu Ketha?\u201d I asked him. Are you coal? \u201cTu mahne?\u201d Are you a shadow?", "I wanted to say twilight, but I couldn\u2019t bring the Siaru word to mind. Rather than pause, I just bulled ahead, faking it as best I could as I eyed his hooves to see if they were chipped or cracked. \u201cTu Keth-Selhan?\u201d Are you first night?", "The big black lowered his head and nuzzled me. \u201cYou like that one, do you?\u201d I said with a bit of a laugh, knowing that what really happened was that he had caught scent of the package of dried apple I had tucked in one of the pockets of my cloak. The important thing was that he had a feel for me now. If he was comfortable enough to nuzzle at me for food, we could get along well enough for a hard day\u2019s ride.", "\u201cKeth-Selhan seems to suit him for a name,\u201d I said, turning back to Kaerva. \u201cAnything else I need to know?\u201d", "Kaerva seemed disconcerted. \u201cHe shies a bit on his right side.\u201d", "\u201cA bit?\u201d", "\u201cJust a bit. It stands to reason that he\u2019s probably a bit prone to spooking on that side too, but I haven\u2019t seen him do it.\u201d", "\u201cHow\u2019s he trained? Close rein or trouper style?", "\u201cClose.\u201d", "\u201cFine. You\u2019ve got one minute left to make this deal. He\u2019s a good animal, but I\u2019m not paying twenty talents for him.\u201d I spoke with certainty in my voice, but no hope in my heart. He was a gorgeous animal, and his coloring made him worth at least twenty talents. Still, I\u2019d go through the motions and hope to squeeze the man down to nineteen. That at least would leave me money for food and lodging when I got to Trebon.", "\u201cVery well,\u201d Kaerva said. \u201cSixteen.\u201d", "Only my years of stage training kept me from gaping openly at his sudden drop. \u201cFifteen,\u201d I said, feigning irritation. \u201cAnd that will include the saddle, tack, and a bag of oats.\u201d I began pulling money out of my purse as if the deal was already finished.", "Unbelievably, Kaerva nodded and called for one of the boys to bring a saddle and tack.", "I counted the money into Kaerva\u2019s hand as his assistant saddled the big black. The Ceald seemed uncomfortable meeting my eye.", "If I didn\u2019t know horses as well as I do, I would have thought I was being swindled. Maybe the horse was stolen, or the man was desperate for money", "Whatever the reason, I didn\u2019t care. I was due a bit of good luck. Best of all, this meant that I might be able to resell the horse at a bit of a profit after I reached Trebon. Honestly, I would need to sell him as soon as I could manage, even if I lost money on the deal. Stabling, food, and grooming for a horse like this would cost me a penny a day. I couldn\u2019t afford to keep him.", "I strapped my travelsack into a saddlebag, checked the cinch and stirrups, then swung myself up onto Keth-Selhan\u2019s back. He danced slightly to the right, eager to be off. That made two of us. I twitched the reins and we were on our way.", "", "Most problems with horses have nothing to do with the horses themselves. They stem from the ignorance of the rider. Folk shoe their horses badly, saddle them improperly, feed them poorly, then complain that they were sold a half-lame, swayback, ill-tempered hack.", "I knew horses. My parents had taught me to ride and care for them. While most of my experience had been with sturdier breeds, bred to pull rather than to race, I knew how to cover ground quickly when I needed to.", "When they\u2019re in a hurry, most folk push their mount too hard too soon. They head out at a dead gallop, then find themselves with a horse lame or half dead inside an hour. Pure idiocy. Only a twelve-color bastard treats a horse that way.", "But to be entirely truthful, I would have ridden Keth-Selhan to death if it would have brought me to Trebon in a timely fashion. There are some times when I am willing to be a bastard. I would have killed a dozen horses if it would have helped me get more information about the Chandrian and why they had killed my parents.", "But ultimately, there was no sense in thinking that way. A dead horse wouldn\u2019t get me to Trebon. A live one would.", "So I started Keth-Selhan at a nice walk to warm him up. He was eager to go faster, probably sensing my own impatience, and that would have been fine if I\u2019d only needed to go a mile or three. But I needed him for at least fifty, maybe seventy, and that meant patience. I had to rein him back down to a walk twice before he resigned himself to it.", "After a mile, I trotted him for a bit. His gait was smooth, even for a Khershaen, but a trot is jarring no matter what, and it pulled at the new stitches in my side. I urged him up to a canter after another mile or so. Only after we were three or four miles out of Imre and we came to a good, straight stretch of flat road did I nudge him up to a gallop.", "Finally given the chance to run, he surged ahead. The sun had just finished burning away the morning dew, and farmers harvesting wheat and barley in the fields looked up as we thundered past. Keth-Selhan was fast; so fast that the wind tore at my cloak, stretching it behind me like a flag. Despite the fact that I knew I must cut quite the dramatic figure, I quickly grew tired of the drag on my neck, unfastened the cloak, then stuffed it into a saddlebag.", "When we passed through a stand of trees, I brought Selhan back down to a trot. That way he got a little rest, and we didn\u2019t run the risk of rounding a corner and barreling into a fallen tree or slow-moving cart. When we came out into pastureland and could see our way clear, I gave him his head again and we practically flew.", "After an hour and a half of this, Selhan was sweating and breathing hard, but he was doing better than I was. My legs were a rubbery mess. I was fit enough, and young, but I hadn\u2019t been in the saddle for years. Riding uses different muscles than walking, and riding at a gallop is just as hard as running unless you want to make your horse work twice as hard for every mile.", "Suffice to say I welcomed the next stretch of trees. I hopped out of the saddle and walked to give both of us a well-deserved break. I cut one of my apples down the middle and gave him the larger half. I figured we\u2019d come about thirty miles, and the sun wasn\u2019t even fully at zenith.", "\u201cThat\u2019s the easy bit,\u201d I told him, stroking his neck fondly. \u201cLord, but you are lovely. You\u2019re not half blown yet, are you?\u201d", "We walked for about ten minutes, then we had the good luck to come across a little creek with a wooden bridge running across it. I let him drink for a long minute, then pulled him away before he took too much.", "Then I mounted up and gaited him back up to a gallop by slow stages. My legs burned and ached as I leaned over his neck. The drumming of his hooves was like a counterpoint to the slow song of the wind, endlessly burning past my ears.", "The first snag came about an hour later when we had to cross a wide stream. It wasn\u2019t treacherous by any means, but I had to unsaddle him and carry everything across rather than risk it getting wet. I couldn\u2019t ride him for hours wearing a wet harness.", "On the other side of the river I dried him off with my blanket and re-saddled him. It took half an hour, which meant he had gone from being rested to being cold, so I had to warm him up gently, slow walk to trot to canter. That stream cost me an hour all told. I worried if there was another one the chill would get into Selhan\u2019s muscles. If that happened, Tehlu himself wouldn\u2019t be able to bring him up to a gallop again.", "An hour later I passed through a small town, hardly more than a church and a tavern that happened to be next to each other. I stopped long enough to let Selhan drink a bit from a trough. I stretched my numb legs and looked up anxiously at the sun.", "After that, the fields and farms grew fewer and farther between. The trees grew thicker and denser. The road narrowed and was not in good repair, rocky in places, washed out in others. It made for slower and slower going. But, truth be told, neither myself or Keth-Selhan had much more galloping left in us.", "Eventually we came to another stream crossing the road. Not much more than a foot deep at the most. The water had a sharp, foul smell that let me know there was a tannery upstream, or a refinery. There wasn\u2019t any bridge, and Keth-Selhan made his way slowly across, placing his hooves gingerly on the rocky bottom. I wondered idly if it felt good, like when you dandle your feet in the water after a long day\u2019s walking.", "The stream didn\u2019t slow us down much, but over the next half hour we had to cross it three separate times as it wound back and forth across the road. It was an inconvenience more than anything, never much deeper than a foot and half. Each time we crossed it the acrid smell of the water was worse. Solvents and acids. If not a refinery, then at least a mine. I kept my hands on the reins, ready to pull Selhan\u2019s head up if he tried to drink, but he was smarter than that.", "A long canter later I came up over a hill and looked down onto a crossroads at the bottom of a small grassy valley Right under the signpost was a tinker with a pair of donkeys, one of them loaded so high with bags and bundles that it looked ready to tip over, the other conspicuously unburdened. It stood by the side of the dirt road grazing with a small mountain of gear piled beside it.", "The tinker sat on a small stool at the side of the road, looking dispirited. His expression brightened when he saw me riding down the hill.", "I read the signpost as I came closer. North was Trebon. South was Temfalls. I reined in as I approached. Keth-Selhan and I could both use the rest, and I was not in enough of a hurry to be rude to a tinker. Not by half. If nothing else the fellow could tell me how far I had left to go before I came to Trebon.", "\u201cHello there!\u201d he said, looking up at me, shading his eyes with one hand. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the look of a lad that\u2019s wanting something.\u201d He was older, balding, with a round, friendly face.", "I laughed. \u201cI\u2019m wanting a lot of things, tinker, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve got any of them in your packs.\u201d", "He gave me an ingratiating smile. \u201cWell now, don\u2019t go assuming ...\u201d He stopped and looked down for a moment, thoughtfully. When he met my eyes again his expression was still kind, but more serious than before. \u201cListen, I\u2019ll be honest with you, son. My little donkey has got herself a stone bruise in her forehoof and can\u2019t carry her load. I\u2019m stuck here until I come by some manner of help.\u201d", "\u201cNormally nothing would make me happier than to help you, tinker,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I need to get to Trebon as quickly as I can.\u201d", "\u201cThat won\u2019t take much doing.\u201d He nodded over the hill to the north. \u201cYou\u2019re only about a half mile out. If the wind was blowing southerly you could smell the smoke.\u201d", "I looked in the direction he gestured and saw chimney smoke rising from behind the hill. A great wave of relief washed over me. I\u2019d made it, and it was barely an hour after noon.", "The tinker continued. \u201cI need to get to the Evesdown docks.\u201d He nodded to the east. \u201cI\u2019ve made arrangements to ship downriver and I\u2019d dearly love to catch my boat.\u201d He eyed my horse significantly. \u201cBut I\u2019ll need a new pack animal to carry my gear....\u201d", "It seems my luck had finally turned. Selhan was a fine horse, but now that I was in Trebon, he would be little more than a constant drain on my limited resources.", "Still, it\u2019s never wise to look eager to sell. \u201cThis is an awful lot of horse to be used for packing,\u201d I said, patting Keth-Selhan\u2019s neck. \u201cHe\u2019s a full-blooded Khershaen, and I can tell you I\u2019ve never seen a better horse in all my days.\u201d", "The tinker looked him over skeptically. \u201cHe\u2019s knackered is what he is,\u201d he said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t got another mile left in him.\u201d", "I swung off the saddle, staggering a bit when my rubbery legs almost buckled underneath me. \u201cYou should give him some credit, tinker. He\u2019s come all the way from Imre today.\u201d", "The tinker chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re not a bad liar, boy, but you need to know when to stop. If the bait\u2019s too big, the fish won\u2019t bite.\u201d", "I didn\u2019t need to pretend to be horrified. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t properly introduce myself\u201d I held out my hand. \u201cMy name is Kvothe, I am a trouper and one of the Edema Ruh. Never on my most desperate day would I lie to a tinker.\u201d", "The tinker shook my hand. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, slightly taken aback, \u201cmy sincere apologies to you and your family. It\u2019s rare to see one of your folk alone on the road.\u201d He looked the horse over critically. \u201cAll the way from Imre, you say?\u201d I nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s what, almost sixty miles? Hell of a ride....\u201d He looked at me with a knowing smile. \u201cHow are your legs?\u201d", "I grinned back at him. \u201cLet\u2019s just say I\u2019ll be glad to be on my own feet again. He\u2019s good for another ten miles I\u2019d guess. But I can\u2019t say the same for myself.\u201d", "The tinker looked over the horse again and gave a gusty sigh. \u201cWell, as I said, you\u2019ve got me over a bit of a barrel. How much do you want for him?\u201d", "\u201cWell,\u201d I said. \u201cKeth-Selhan here\u2019s a full-blood Khershaen, and his color is lovely, you have to admit. Not a patch on him but isn\u2019t black. Not a white whisker\u2014\u201d", "The tinker burst out laughing. \u201cI take it back,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re a terrible liar.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t see what\u2019s so funny,\u201d I said a little stiffly", "The tinker gave me an odd look. \u201cNot a white whisker, no.\u201d He nodded past me toward Selhan\u2019s hindquarters. \u201cBut if he\u2019s all black then I\u2019m Oren Velciter.\u201d", "I turned to look and saw that Keth-Selhan\u2019s left hind foot had a distinct white sock that went halfway up to his hock. Stupefied, I walked back and bent down to look. It wasn\u2019t a clean white, more of a washed-out grey. I could smell the faint odor of the stream we had splashed through on the last leg of our journey: solvents.", "\u201cThat shim bastard,\u201d I said incredulously. \u201cHe sold me a dyed horse.\u201d", "\u201cDidn\u2019t the name tip you off?\u201d the tinker chuckled. \u201cKeth-Selhan? Lord boy, someone\u2019s been thumbing their nose at you.\u201d", "\u201cHis name means twilight,\u201d I said.", "The tinker shook his head, \u201cYour Siaru is rusty. Ket-Selem would be \u2018first-night.\u2019 Selhan means \u2018sock.\u2019 His name is one sock.\u201d", "I thought back to the horse-trader\u2019s reaction when I\u2019d picked the name. No wonder the fellow had seemed so disconcerted. No wonder he had dropped the price so quickly and easily. He thought I knew his little secret.", "The tinker laughed at my expression and clapped me on the back. \u201cDon\u2019t sweat it, lad. It happens to the best of us from time to time,\u201d he turned away and began to rummage through his bundles. \u201cI think I have something you\u2019ll like. Let me offer you a trade.\u201d He turned around and held out something black and gnarled like a piece of driftwood.", "I took it from him and looked it over. It was heavy and cold to the touch. \u201cA lump of slag iron?\u201d I asked. \u201cAre you out of magic beans?\u201d", "The tinker held out a pin in his other hand. He held it about a handspan away then let go. Instead of falling, the pin snapped to the side and clung to the smooth blob of black iron.", "I drew in an appreciative breath. \u201cA loden-stone? I\u2019ve never seen one of these.\u201d", "\u201cTechnically, it\u2019s a Trebon-stone,\u201d he said matter-of-factly \u201cAs it\u2019s never been near Loden, but you\u2019re near enough. There\u2019s all manner of people who would be interested in that beauty down Imre-way ...\u201d", "I nodded absently as I turned it over in my hands. I\u2019d always wanted to see a drawstone, ever since I was a child. I pulled the pin away, feeling the strange attraction it had to smooth black metal. I marveled. A piece of star-iron in my hand. \u201cHow much do you figure it\u2019s worth?\u201d I asked.", "The tinker sucked his teeth a little. \u201cWell I\u2019m figuring right here and now it\u2019s worth just about one full-blooded Khershaen pack mule....\u201d", "I turned it over in my hand, pulled the pin away and let it snap back again. \u201cTrouble is tinker, I put myself into debt with a dangerous woman in order to buy this horse. If I don\u2019t sell it well, I\u2019m going to be in a desperate way.\u201d", "He nodded. \u201cPiece of sky-iron of that size, if you take less than eighteen talents you\u2019re cutting a hole in your own purse. Jewelers will buy it, or rich folk who want it for the novelty.\u201d He tapped the side of his nose. \u201cBut if you head to the University you\u2019ll do better. Artificers have a great love for loden-stone. Alchemists too. If you find one in the right mood you\u2019ll get more.\u201d", "It was a good deal. Manet had taught me loden-stone was quite valuable and difficult to come by. Not only for its galvanic properties, but because pieces of sky-iron like this often had rare metals mingled with the iron. I held out my hand. \u201cI\u2019m willing to make it a deal.\u201d", "We shook hands solemnly, then just as the tinker began to reach for the reins, I asked, \u201cAnd what will you give me for his tack and saddle?\u201d", "I was a little worried that the tinker might take offense at my wheedling, but instead he smiled a sly smile. \u201cThat\u2019s a clever lad,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cI like a fellow who\u2019s not afraid to push for a little extra. What would you like then? I\u2019ve got a lovely woolen blanket here. Or some nice rope?\u201d He pulled a coil of it out of the donkey\u2019s packs. \u201cAlways good to have a piece of rope with you. Oh, how about this?\u201d He turned around with a bottle in his hands and winked at me. \u201cI\u2019ve got some lovely Avennish fruit wine. I\u2019ll give you all three for your horse\u2019s gear.\u201d", "\u201cI could use a spare blanket,\u201d I admitted. Then a thought occurred to me. \u201cDo you have any clothes near my size? I seem to be going through a lot of shirts lately.\u201d", "The old man paused, holding the rope and bottle of wine, then shrugged and began to dig around in his packs.", "\u201cHave you heard anything about a wedding around these parts?\u201d I asked. Tinkers always have their ears to the ground.", "\u201cThe Mauthen wedding?\u201d He tied off one pack and began to dig through another. \u201cI hate to tell you but you missed it. Happened yesterday.\u201d", "My stomach clenched at his casual tone. If there had been a massacre the tinker would certainly have heard. I suddenly had the horrible thought that I\u2019d put myself in debt and run halfway to the mountains on a goose chase. \u201cWere you there? Did anything odd happen?\u201d", "\u201cHere we are!\u201d The tinker turned around holding up a shirt of plain grey homespun. \u201cNothing fancy, I\u2019m afraid, but it\u2019s new. Well, newish.\u201d He held it up to my chest to judge the fit.", "\u201cThe wedding?\u201d I prompted.", "\u201cWhat? Oh no. I wasn\u2019t there. Bit of an event though, from what I understand. Mauthen\u2019s only daughter and they were sending her off proper. Been planning it for months.\u201d", "\u201cSo you didn\u2019t hear of anything odd happening?\u201d I asked, a sinking feeling in my gut.", "He shrugged helplessly \u201cLike I said, I wasn\u2019t there. I\u2019ve been up around the ironworks the last couple days,\u201d he nodded to the west. \u201cTrading with panners and folk up in the high rock.\u201d He tapped the side of his head as if he\u2019d just remembered something. \u201cThat reminds me, I found a brassie up in the hills.\u201d He rummaged in his packs again and brought out a flat, thick bottle. \u201cIf you don\u2019t care for wine, maybe something a little stronger ... ?\u201d", "I started to shake my head, then realized that some homemade brand would be useful cleaning my side tonight. \u201cI might be....\u201d I said. \u201cDepending on the offer on the table.\u201d", "\u201cHonest young gent like yourself,\u201d he said grandly \u201cI\u2019ll give you blanket, both bottles, and the coil of rope.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re generous, tinker. But I\u2019d rather have the shirt than the rope and the fruit wine. They\u2019d just be dead weight in my bag and I\u2019ve got a lot of walking ahead of me.\u201d", "His expression soured a little, but he shrugged. \u201cYour call, of course. Blanket, shirt, brand, and three jots.\u201d", "We shook hands, and I took time to help him load Keth-Selhan because I had the vague feeling that I\u2019d insulted him by turning down his previous offer. Ten minutes later he was heading east, and I made my way north over the green hills into Trebon.", "I was glad to walk the last half-mile under my own power as it helped me work the stiffness from my legs and back. As I crested the hill, I saw Trebon sprawling out below, tucked into a low bowl made by the hills. It wasn\u2019t a large town by any means, perhaps a hundred buildings sprawling around a dozen winding, packed-dirt streets.", "In the early days with the troupe, I\u2019d learned how to size up a town. It\u2019s a lot like reading your audience when you\u2019re playing in a tavern. The stakes are higher of course, play the wrong song in a tavern and people might hiss you, but misjudge an entire town and things can get uglier than that.", "So I sized up Trebon. It was off the beaten path, halfway between a mining town and a farming town. They weren\u2019t likely to be instantly suspicious of strangers, but it was small enough that everyone knew by looking at you that you weren\u2019t one of the locals.", "I was surprised to see people setting up straw-stuffed shamble-men outside their homes. That meant that despite the proximity to Imre and the University, Trebon was truly a backwater community. Every town has a harvest festival of some sort, but these days most folk settle for having a bonfire and getting drunk. The fact that they were following old folk traditions meant people in Trebon were more superstitious than I would usually expect.", "Despite that, I liked seeing the shamble-men. I have a fondness for the traditional harvest festivals, superstitions and all. They\u2019re a type of theater, really", "The Tehlin church was the nicest building in town, three stories tall and made of quarried stone. Nothing odd about that, but bolted above the front doors, high above the ground, was one of the biggest iron wheels I\u2019d ever seen. It was real iron too, not just painted wood. It was ten feet tall and must have weighed a solid ton. Ordinarily such a display would have made me nervous, but since Trebon was a mining town I guessed it showed civic pride more than fanatic piety.", "Most of the other buildings in town were low to the ground, built of rough timber with cedar-shingle roofs. The inn was respectable though, two stories tall, with plaster walls and red clay tiles on the roof. There was bound to be someone in there who would know more about the wedding.", "There was a bare handful of people inside, not surprising as harvest was in full swing and there were still five or six hours of good daylight left. I put on my best anxious expression as I made my way over to the bar where the innkeeper stood.", "\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I said. \u201cI hate to trouble you, but I\u2019m looking for someone.\u201d", "The innkeeper was a dark-haired man with a perpetual scowl. \u201cWho\u2019s that then?\u201d", "\u201cMy cousin was here for a wedding,\u201d I said, \u201cand I heard there was some trouble.\u201d", "At the word wedding the innkeeper\u2019s scowl turned stony. I could feel the two men farther down the bar not looking at me, pointedly not looking anywhere in my direction. It was true then. Something terrible had happened.", "I saw the innkeeper reach out and press his fingers onto the bar. It took me a second to realize he was touching the iron head of a nail driven into the wood. \u201cBad business,\u201d he said shortly. \u201cNothing I care to say about it.\u201d", "\u201cPlease,\u201d I said, letting worry bleed into my tone. \u201cI was visiting family in Temfalls when the rumor came down that something had happened. They\u2019re all busy pulling in the last of the wheat, so I promised I\u2019d come up and see what the trouble was.\u201d", "The innkeeper looked me up and down. A gawker he could turn away, but he couldn\u2019t deny me the right to know what had happened to a family member. \u201cThere\u2019s the one upstairs who was there,\u201d he said shortly. \u201cNot from around here. Might be your cousin.\u201d", "A witness! I opened my mouth to ask another question, but he shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know a thing about it,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cDon\u2019t care to, either.\u201d", "He turned and made himself suddenly busy with the taps of his beer barrels. \u201cUp at the far end of the hall, on the left.\u201d", "I headed across the room and up the stairs. I could feel everyone not looking at me now. Their silence and the innkeeper\u2019s tone made it clear that whoever was upstairs was not one of the many who had been there, it was the one. One survivor.", "I went to the end of the hallway and knocked on the door. First softly, then again, louder. I opened the door slowly, so as not to startle whoever might be inside.", "It was a narrow room with a narrow bed. A woman lay on it, fully clothed, one arm wrapped in a bandage. Her head was turned toward the window, so I could only see her profile.", "Still I recognized her. Denna.", "I must have made some noise, because she turned to look at me. Her eyes went wide and for once she was the one who was at a loss for words.", "\u201cI heard you were in some trouble,\u201d I said nonchalantly. \u201cSo I thought I\u2019d come and help.\u201d", "Her eyes went wide for a moment, then narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d she said with a wry twist to her lips.", "\u201cI am,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut it\u2019s a pretty lie.\u201d I took a step into the room and closed the door softly. \u201cI would have come, if I\u2019d known.\u201d", "\u201cAnyone can make the trip after they get the news,\u201d she said dismissively \u201cIt takes a special sort of man to show up when he doesn\u2019t know there\u2019s trouble.\u201d She sat up and turned to face me, swinging her legs over the side of the bed.", "Now that I looked more closely, I noticed that she had a bruise high on one temple in addition to the bandage on her arm. I took another step toward her, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d I asked.", "\u201cNo,\u201d she said bluntly. \u201cBut I could be a damn sight worse off.\u201d She came to her feet slowly, as if she was unsure how steady she would be. She took a cautious step or two and seemed more or less satisfied. \u201cRight. I can walk. Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d", "", "", ""], "CHAPTER SEVENTY-TWO": ["CHAPTER SEVENTY-TWO", "Borrorill", "\nDenna turned left instead of right as she came out of her room. At first I thought she was disoriented, but when she came to a back stairway I saw she was actually trying to leave without heading through the taproom. She found the alley door, but it was locked fast.", "So we headed out the front. As soon as we entered the taproom I was pointedly aware of everyone\u2019s attention on us. Denna made a beeline for the front door, moving but with the slow determination of a storm cloud.", "We were almost out when the man behind the bar called out. \u201cHoy! Hey now!\u201d", "Denna\u2019s eyes flickered to the side. Her mouth made a thin line and she continued her walk to the door as if she hadn\u2019t heard.", "\u201cI\u2019ll deal with him,\u201d I said softly. \u201cWait for me. I\u2019ll be out in just a second.\u201d", "I walked over to where the barman stood scowling. \u201cThat your cousin then?\u201d he asked. \u201cHas the constable said she can go?\u201d", "\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want to know anything about it,\u201d I said.", "\u201cI surely don\u2019t. But she\u2019s had use of the room, and meals, and I had the doctor out to patch her up.\u201d", "I gave him a hard look. \u201cIf there\u2019s a doctor in this town worth more than ha\u2019penny, then I\u2019m the King of Vint.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m out half a talent in all,\u201d he insisted. \u201cBandages ain\u2019t free, and I had a woman by to sit with her, waiting for her to wake up.\u201d", "I doubted very much that he was out half that, but I certainly didn\u2019t want trouble with the constable. In truth, I didn\u2019t want any sort of delay. Given Denna\u2019s tendencies, I was worried that if I lost sight of her for more than a minute she would disappear like morning fog.", "I took five jots from my purse and scattered them onto the bar. \u201cKnackers profit from a plague,\u201d I said scathingly, and left.", "I felt a ridiculous amount of relief when I saw Denna waiting outside, leaning against the horse post. Her eyes were closed and she had her face tilted toward the sun. She sighed contentedly and turned toward the sound of my approaching footsteps.", "\u201cWas it that bad?\u201d I asked.", "\u201cThey were kind enough at first,\u201d Denna admitted, gesturing with her bandaged arm. \u201cBut this old woman kept checking in on me.\u201d She frowned and brushed her long black hair back, giving me a clear view of the purpling bruise that spread from her temple all the way back to her hairline. \u201cYou know the type, some tight-laced spinster with a mouth like a cat\u2019s ass.\u201d", "I burst out laughing, and Denna\u2019s sudden smile was like the sun peering from behind a cloud. Then her face grew dark again as she continued. \u201cShe kept giving me this look. Like I should\u2019ve had the decency to die with all the other folk. Like all this was my fault.\u201d", "Denna shook her head. \u201cBut she was better than the old men. The constable put his hand on my leg!\u201d She shuddered. \u201cEven the mayor came, clucking over me like he cared, but he was only there to badger me with questions. \u2018What were you doing there? What happened? What did you see ... ?\u2019 \u201d", "The scorn in Denna\u2019s voice made me bite back my own questions so quickly that I almost caught my tongue between my teeth. It\u2019s my nature to ask questions, not to mention that the whole purpose of this mad dash into the foothills was to investigate what had happened.", "Still, the tone of Denna\u2019s voice made it clear she was in no mood to give answers right now. I shrugged my travelsack higher up onto my shoulder and something occurred to me. \u201cWait. Your things. You left them all back in your room.\u201d", "Denna hesitated for a heartbeat. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything of mine was there,\u201d she said as if the thought hadn\u2019t even occurred to her before.", "\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to go back and check?\u201d", "She shook her head firmly. \u201cI leave where I\u2019m not welcome,\u201d she said matter-of-factly \u201cEverything else I can make up along the way.\u201d", "Denna started to walk down the street and I fell in beside her. She turned onto a narrow side street heading west. We passed an old woman hanging a shamble-man made of oat sheaves. It wore a crude straw hat and a pair of sackcloth pants. \u201cWhere are we headed?\u201d I asked.", "\u201cI need to see if my things are out at the Mauthen farm,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter that I\u2019m open to suggestions. Where were you planning to go before you found me?\u201d", "\u201cHonestly, I was heading out to the Mauthen farm myself.\u201d", "Denna gave me a sideways look. \u201cFair enough. It\u2019s only about a mile out to the farm. We can be there and still have plenty of light.\u201d", "The land around Trebon was rough, mostly thick forest broken by stretches of rocky ground. Then the road would round a corner and there would be a small, perfect field of golden wheat tucked among the trees, or nestled into a valley surrounded by dark stone bluffs. Farmers and hands dotted the fields, covered in chaff and moving with the slow weariness that comes from knowing half the day\u2019s harvest was still to come.", "We\u2019d only been walking a minute when I heard a familiar thump of hooves behind us. I turned to see a small open-topped cart bumping slowly up the road. Denna and I stepped off into the scrub, as the road was barely wide enough for the cart. A bone weary farmer eyed us suspiciously from where he sat, hunched over the reins.", "\u201cWe\u2019re heading to the Mauthen farm,\u201d Denna called out as he came closer. \u201cWould you mind if we caught a ride?\u201d", "The man eyed us grimly, then nodded toward the back of the cart. \u201cI\u2019m heading past old Borrorill. Ye\u2019ll have to make your own way from there.\u201d", "Denna and I clambered on and sat facing backward on the clapboard with our feet dangling over the edge. It wasn\u2019t much faster than walking, but we were both glad to be off our feet.", "We rode in silence. Denna obviously wasn\u2019t interested in discussing things in front of the farmer, and I was glad to have a moment to think things over. I had planned on telling whatever lies were necessary to get the information I wanted from the witness. Denna complicated things. I didn\u2019t want to lie to her, but at the same time I couldn\u2019t risk telling her too much. The last thing I wanted to do was convince her I was crazy with wild stories of the Chandrian....", "So we rode in silence. It was nice just being near her. You wouldn\u2019t think a girl in bandages with a blackened eye could be beautiful, but Denna was. Lovely as the moon: not flawless, perhaps, but perfect.", "The farmer spoke up, breaking my reverie. \u201cHere\u2019s Borrorill.\u201d", "I looked around for the rill, but couldn\u2019t see it. Which was a shame, as I wouldn\u2019t mind a cool drink or a bit of a wash. Hours of hard riding had left me sweaty and smelling of horse.", "We thanked the farmer and hopped off the back of the cart. Denna led the way along the dirt track that wound back and forth up the side of the hill, between the trees and the occasional outcrop of worn, dark stone. Denna seemed steadier than when we\u2019d left the tavern, but kept her eyes on the ground, choosing her steps with deliberate care as if she didn\u2019t quite trust her balance.", "A sudden thought came to me. \u201cI got your note,\u201d I said, pulling the folded piece of paper out of a pocket in my cloak. \u201cWhen did you leave it for me?\u201d", "\u201cNearly two span ago.\u201d", "I grimaced, \u201cI only got it last night.\u201d", "She nodded to herself. \u201cI worried about that when you never showed up. I thought it might have fallen out, or gotten wet so you couldn\u2019t read it.\u201d", "\u201cI just haven\u2019t used the window lately,\u201d I said.", "Denna shrugged nonchalantly. \u201cSilly of me to assume you would, really.\u201d", "I tried to think of something to add, something that would explain what she might have seen when Fela had given me my cloak in the Eolian. I couldn\u2019t think of anything. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I missed our lunch.\u201d", "Denna looked up, amused. \u201cDeoch said you were caught in a fire or something. Told me you looked positively wretched.\u201d", "\u201cI felt wretched,\u201d I said. \u201cMore from missing you than from the fire....\u201d", "She rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sure you were terribly distraught. You did me a favor in a way. While I was sitting there ... alone ... pining away ...\u201d", "\u201cI said I was sorry.\u201d", "\u201c... an older gentleman introduced himself to me. We talked, got to know each other....\u201d She shrugged and looked sideways at me, almost bashfully. \u201cI\u2019ve been meeting with him ever since. If things continue smoothly, I think he\u2019ll be my patron before the year is out.\u201d", "\u201cReally?\u201d I said, relief splashing over me like cold water. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, and long overdue. Who is he?\u201d", "She shook her head, her dark hair falling down around her face. \u201cI can\u2019t say. He\u2019s obsessed with his privacy. He wouldn\u2019t tell me his real name for more than a span. Even now I don\u2019t know if the name he\u2019s given me is real.\u201d", "\u201cIf you\u2019re not sure who he really is,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cHow do you know he\u2019s a gentleman?\u201d", "It was a foolish question. We both knew the answer, but she said it anyway. \u201cMoney. Clothes. Bearing.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cEven if he\u2019s only a wealthy merchant, he\u2019ll still make a good patron.\u201d", "\u201cBut not a great one. Merchant families don\u2019t have the same stability ...\u201d", "\u201c... and their names don\u2019t carry the same weight,\u201d she finished with another, knowing shrug. \u201cHalf a loaf is better than none, and I\u2019m tired of having no loaf at all.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve been working hard to reel him in. But he\u2019s so dodgy... We never meet in the same place twice, and never in public. Sometimes he\u2019ll set up a meeting and never even show up for it. Not that that\u2019s anything new in my life....\u201d", "Denna staggered as a rock shifted under her foot. I grabbed for her, and she caught hold of my arm and shoulder before she fell. For a moment we were pressed against each other, and I was very aware of her body against mine as she took a moment to balance herself.", "I steadied her, and we moved apart. But after she regained her footing, she kept her hand resting lightly on my arm. I moved slowly, as if a wild bird had landed there and I was desperately trying to avoid startling it into flight.", "I considered putting my arm around her, partly for support and partly for other more obvious reasons. I quickly discarded the idea. I still remembered the look on her face when she mentioned the constable touching her leg. What would I do if she had a similar response to me?", "Men flocked around Denna, and I knew from our conversations how tiresome she found them. I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of making the same mistakes they made, simply because I didn\u2019t know any better. It was better not to risk offending her, better to be safe. As I\u2019ve said before, there is a great difference between being fearless and being brave.", "We followed the path as it doubled back on itself, continuing up the hill. All was silent except for the wind moving in the tall grass.", "\u201cSo he\u2019s secretive?\u201d I prompted gently, worried that the silence would soon become uncomfortable.", "\u201cSecretive doesn\u2019t cover it by half,\u201d Denna said, rolling her eyes. \u201cOnce a woman offered me money for information about him. I played dumb, and later when I told him about it he said it had been a test to see how much I could be trusted. Another time some men threatened me. I\u2019m guessing that was another test.\u201d", "The fellow sounded rather sinister to me, like a fugitive from the law or someone hiding from his family. I was about to say so when I saw Denna looking at me anxiously. She was worried, worried that I would think less of her for pandering to the whimsy of some paranoid lordling.", "I thought about my talk with Deoch, about the fact that, hard as my lot was, hers was undoubtedly harder. What would I put up with if I could win a powerful noble\u2019s patronage? What would I go though to find someone who would give me money for lute strings, see that I was dressed and fed, and protect me from vicious little bastards like Ambrose?", "I bit back my previous comments and gave her a knowing grin. \u201cHe\u2019d better be rich enough to be worth your trouble,\u201d I said. \u201cBags of money. Pots of it.\u201d", "Her mouth quirked up at the corner, and I felt her body relax, glad that I wasn\u2019t judging her. \u201cWell that would be telling, now, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d Her eyes danced, saying: yes.", "\u201cHe\u2019s the reason I\u2019m here,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe told me to show up at this wedding. It\u2019s a lot more rural than I expected, but ...\u201d She shrugged again, a silent comment about the inexplicable desires of the nobility. \u201cI expected my patron-to-be to be there\u2014\u201d She stopped, laughing. \u201cDid that even make any sense?\u201d", "\u201cJust make up a name for him,\u201d I suggested.", "\u201cYou pick one,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t they teach you about names at the University?\u201d", "\u201cAnnabelle,\u201d I suggested.", "\u201cI will not,\u201d she said, laughing, \u201crefer to my potential patron as Annabelle.\u201d", "\u201cThe Duke of Richmoney\u201d", "\u201cNow you\u2019re just being flippant.

As we finally reached the top, the wind gusted past us. Denna gripped my arm for balance and I held up a hand to shield my eyes from dust and leaves. I coughed in surprise as the wind forced a leaf straight into my mouth, causing me to choke and splutter.", "Denna thought this was particularly funny \u201cFine,\u201d I said, as I fished the leaf out of my mouth. It was yellow, shaped like a spearhead. \u201cThe wind has decided for us.

The part of my arm where her hand had rested suddenly felt very cold.", "\u201cBlack hands,\u201d she said, scrubbing at her face. \u201cI\u2019ve got chaff in my eyes.\u201d \u201cNot chaff,\u201d I said, looking across the top of the hill. Not fifty feet away was a cluster of charred buildings that must have once been the Mauthen farm. \u201cAsh.\u201d", "", "I led Denna to a little stand of trees that blocked the wind and the sight of the farm. I gave her my water bottle and we sat on a fallen tree, resting as she rinsed her eyes clean.", "\u201cYou know,\u201d I said hesitantly, \u201cyou don\u2019t need to go over there. I could look for your things if you tell me where you left them.\u201d", "Her eyes narrowed a little. \u201cI can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re being considerate or condescending....\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know what you saw last night. So I don\u2019t know how delicate I should be.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t need much delicacy, as a rule,\u201d she said shortly. \u201cI\u2019m no blushing daisy\u201d", "\u201cDaisies don\u2019t blush.\u201d", "Denna looked at me, blinking her red eyes.", "\u201cYou\u2019re probably thinking of \u2018shrinking violet\u2019 or \u2018blushing virgin.\u2019 Either way, daisies are white. They can\u2019t blush....\u201d", "\u201cThat,\u201d she said flatly, \u201cwas condescending.\u201d", "\u201cWell, I thought I\u2019d let you know what it looked like,\u201d I said. \u201cFor comparison. So there\u2019s less confusion when I\u2019m trying to be considerate.\u201d", "We stared at each other for a bit, eventually she looked away, rubbing at her eyes. \u201cFair enough,\u201d she admitted. She tilted her head back and splashed more water onto her face, blinking furiously.", "\u201cI really didn\u2019t see much,\u201d she said as she daubed her face on her shirtsleeve. \u201cI played before the wedding, then again while they were getting ready for supper. I kept expecting my ...\u201d she gave a faint smile, \u201c... Master Ash to make an appearance, but I knew I couldn\u2019t dare ask about him. For all I knew, the whole thing was another test of his.\u201d", "She trailed off, frowning. \u201cHe has a way of signaling me. A way of letting me know when he\u2019s around. I excused myself and found him over by the barn. We headed into the woods for a bit and he asked me questions. Who was there, how many people, what they looked like.\u201d She looked thoughtful.", "\u201cNow that I\u2019m thinking of it, I think that was the real test. He wanted to see how observant I was.\u201d", "\u201cHe almost sounds like a spy,\u201d I mused.", "Denna shrugged. \u201cWe wandered for about half an hour, talking. Then he heard something and told me to wait for him. He headed off toward the farmhouse and was gone for a long while.\u201d", "\u201cHow long?\u201d", "\u201cTen minutes?\u201d she shrugged. \u201cYou know how it is when you\u2019re waiting for someone. It was dark and I was cold and hungry.\u201d She wrapped her arms around her stomach and leaned forward a little. \u201cGods, I\u2019m hungry now, too. I wish I would\u2019ve ...\u201d", "I pulled an apple out of my travelsack and handed it to her. They were gorgeous, red as blood, sweet, and crisp. The sort of apples you dream about all year but can only get for a few weeks during the fall.", "Denna gave me a curious look. \u201cI used to travel a lot,\u201d I explained as I took one for myself. \u201cAnd I used to be hungry a lot. So I usually carry something to eat. I\u2019ll fix you a real dinner when we set camp for the night.\u201d", "\u201cAnd he cooks, too....\u201d She bit into the apple and took a drink of water to wash it down. \u201cAnyway, I thought I heard shouting, so I headed back in the direction of the farm. When I came out from behind a bluff, I could definitely hear screaming and shouting. Then I got closer and smelled smoke. And I saw the light of the fire through the trees\u2014\u201d", "\u201cWhat color was it?\u201d I asked, my mouth half full of apple.", "Denna looked at me sharply, her expression suddenly suspicious. \u201cWhy do you ask that?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I interrupted,\u201d I said swallowing my mouthful of apple. \u201cFinish your story first and I\u2019ll tell you afterward.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve been talking an awful lot,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you haven\u2019t made any mention at all of why you\u2019re up in this little corner of the world.\u201d", "\u201cThe masters down at the University heard some odd rumors and sent me here to find out if they were true,\u201d I said. There was no awkwardness or hesitation in the lie. I didn\u2019t even plan it, really, it just came out. Forced to make a snap decision, I couldn\u2019t safely tell her the truth about my search for the Chandrian. I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of Denna thinking I was brain-addled.", "\u201cThe University does that sort of thing?\u201d Denna asked. \u201cI thought you lot just sat around reading books.\u201d", "\u201cSome folks read,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut when we hear strange rumors, someone needs to go out and find out what\u2019s really happened. When people get superstitious, they start to look toward the University and think, Who around here is meddling with dark powers better left alone? Who should we toss into a great, blazing bonfire?\u201d", "\u201cSo you do this sort of thing a lot?\u201d She made a gesture with her half-eaten apple. \u201cInvestigate things?\u201d", "I shook my head. \u201cI just got on a master\u2019s bad side. He made sure I drew the short straw for this little trip.\u201d", "Not a bad lie, considering it was off the cuff. It would even hold up if she did any asking around, as parts of it were true. When necessity demands it, I\u2019m an excellent liar. Not the noblest of skills, but useful. It ties closely to acting and storytelling, and I learned all three from my father, who was a master craftsman.", "\u201cYou are so full of horseshit,\u201d she said matter-of-factly.", "I froze with my teeth halfway into my apple. I pulled back, leaving white impressions in the red skin. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d", "She shrugged. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to tell me, that\u2019s fine. But don\u2019t fabricate some story out of a misguided desire to pacify or impress me.\u201d", "I drew a deep breath, hesitated, and let it out slowly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lie to you about why I\u2019m here,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I worry what you might think if I tell you the truth.\u201d", "Denna\u2019s eyes were dark, thoughtful, and gave nothing away. \u201cFair enough,\u201d she said at last with an almost imperceptible nod. \u201cI believe that.\u201d", "She took a bite of her apple and gave me a long look as she chewed, never looking away from my eyes. Her lips were wet and redder than the apple. \u201cI heard some rumors.\u201d I said at last. \u201cAnd I want to know what happened here. That\u2019s all really. I just ...\u201d", "\u201cListen Kvothe, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Denna sighed and ran a hand through her hair. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have pushed you. It\u2019s none of my business, really. I know what it\u2019s like to have secrets.\u201d", "I almost told her everything then. The whole story about my parents, the Chandrian, the man with black eyes and a nightmare smile. But I worried it might seem like the desperate elaboration of a child caught in a lie. So instead I took the coward\u2019s way out and stayed silent.", "\u201cYou\u2019ll never find your true love that way,\u201d Denna said.", "I snapped out of my reverie, confused. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d", "\u201cYou eat the core of your apple,\u201d she said, amused. \u201cYou eat it all around, then from the bottom to the top. I\u2019ve never seen anyone do that before.\u201d", "\u201cOld habit,\u201d I said dismissively, not wanting to tell her the truth. That there had been a time in my life when the core was all of the apple I was likely to find, and I\u2019d been glad of it. \u201cWhat did you mean before?\u201d", "\u201cDidn\u2019t you ever play that game?\u201d she held up her own apple core and grabbed the stem with two fingers. \u201cYou think of a letter and twist. If the stem stays on you think of another letter and twist again. When the stem breaks off...\u201d hers did, \u201c... you know the first letter of the name of the person you\u2019re going to fall in love with.\u201d", "I looked down at the tiny piece of apple I had left. Not enough to grip and twist. I bit off the last of the apple and tossed the stem. \u201cLooks like I\u2019m destined to be loveless.\u201d", "\u201cThere you go with seven words again,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cYou do realize you always do that?\u201d", "It took me a minute to realize what she was referring to, but before I could respond Denna had moved on. \u201cI heard the seeds are supposed to be bad for you,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have arsenic in them.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s just a wives\u2019 tale,\u201d I said. It was one of the ten thousand questions I\u2019d asked Ben when he\u2019d traveled with the troupe. \u201cIt\u2019s not arsenic. It\u2019s cyanide, and there\u2019s not enough to hurt you unless you eat bucketsful.\u201d", "\u201cOh.\u201d Denna gave the remains of her apple a speculative look, then began to eat it from the bottom up.", "\u201cYou were telling me about what happened to Master Ash before I rudely interrupted,\u201d I prompted gently as I could.", "Denna shrugged. \u201cThere isn\u2019t much left to tell. I saw the fire, came closer, heard more shouting and commotion....\u201d", "\u201cAnd the fire?\u201d", "She hesitated. \u201cBlue.\u201d", "I felt a sort of dark anticipation rise up in me. Excitement at finally being close to answers about the Chandrian, fear at the thought of being close to them. \u201cWhat did the ones look like who attacked you? How did you get away?\u201d", "She gave a bitter laugh. \u201cNobody attacked me. I saw shapes outlined against the fire and ran like billy-hell.\u201d She lifted her bandaged arm and touched the side of her head. \u201cI must have gone headfirst into a tree and knocked myself out. I woke up in town this morning.", "\u201cThat\u2019s the other reason I needed to come back,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Master Ash might still be out here. I didn\u2019t hear anyone in town talking about finding an extra body, but I couldn\u2019t ask without making everyone suspicious....\u201d", "\u201cAnd he wouldn\u2019t like that,\u201d I said.", "Denna nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt he\u2019ll turn this into another test to see how well I can keep my mouth shut.\u201d She gave me a significant look. \u201cSpeaking of which ...\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll make a point of being terribly surprised if we find anyone,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d", "She smiled nervously. \u201cThanks. I just hope he\u2019s alive. I\u2019ve invested two whole span trying to win him over.\u201d She took a final drink out of my water bottle and handed it back to me. \u201cLet\u2019s go have a look around, shall we?\u201d", "Denna came unsteadily to her feet, and I tucked my water bottle back into my travelsack, watching her out of the corner of my eye. I had worked in the Medica for the better part of a year. Denna had been struck on her left temple hard enough to blacken her eye and bruise her well past her ear into her hairline. Her right arm was bandaged, and from the way she carried herself, I guessed she had some serious bruises along her left side, if not a few broken ribs.", "If she had run into a tree, it must have been an oddly shaped tree.", "But still, I didn\u2019t make a point of it. Didn\u2019t press her.", "How could I? I too knew what it was like to have secrets.", "", "The farm was nowhere near as gruesome as it could have been. The barn was nothing but a jumble of ash and planking. To one side a water trough stood next to a charred windmill. The wind tried to spin the wheel, but it only had three fins left, and it simply swayed back and forth, back and forth.", "There were no bodies. Only the deep ruts wagon wheels had cut into the turf when they had come to haul them away.", "\u201cHow many people were at the wedding?\u201d I asked.", "\u201cTwenty-six, counting the bride and groom.\u201d Denna kicked idly at a charred timber half buried in ashes near the remains of the barn. \u201cGood thing it usually rains in the evenings here, or this whole side of the mountain would be on fire by now....\u201d", "\u201cAny simmering feuds lurking around here?\u201d I asked. \u201cRival families? Another suitor looking for revenge?\u201d", "\u201cOf course,\u201d Denna said easily. \u201cLittle town like this, that\u2019s what keeps things on an even keel. These folk will carry a grudge for fifty years about what their Tom said about our Kari.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cBut nothing of the killing sort. These were normal folks.\u201d", "Normal but wealthy, I thought to myself as I walked toward the farmhouse. This was the sort of house only a wealthy family could afford to build. The foundation and the lower walls were solid grey stone. The upper story was plaster and timber with stone reinforcing the corners.", "Still, the walls sagged inward on the verge of collapse. The windows and door gaped with dark soot licking out around the edges. I peered through the doorway and saw the grey stone of the walls charred black. There was broken crockery scattered among the remains of furniture and charred floorboards.", "\u201cIf your things were in there,\u201d I said to Denna. \u201cI think they\u2019re as good as gone. I could go in for a look....\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d she said. \u201cThis whole thing is about to come down.\u201d She knocked a knuckle against the doorframe. It echoed hollowly.", "Curious at the odd sound of it, I went over to look. I picked at the doorpost with a fingernail and a long splinter the size of my palm peeled away with little resistance. \u201cThis is more like driftwood than timber,\u201d I said. \u201cAfter spending all this money, why skimp on the doorframe?\u201d", "Denna shrugged. \u201cMaybe the heat of the fire did it?\u201d", "I nodded absently and continued to wander around, looking things over. I bent to pick up a piece of charred shingle and muttered a binding under my breath. A brief chill spread up my arms and flame flickered to life along the rough edge of the wood.", "\u201cThat\u2019s something you don\u2019t see every day,\u201d Denna said. Her voice was calm, but it was a forced calm, as if she was trying hard to sound nonchalant.", "It took me a moment to figure out what she was talking about. Simple sympathy like this was so commonplace in the University that I hadn\u2019t even thought about how it would look to someone else.", "\u201cJust a little meddling with dark forces better left alone,\u201d I said lightly, holding up the burning shingle. \u201cThe fire was blue last night?\u201d", "She nodded. \u201cLike a coal-gas flame. Like the lamps they have in Anilen.\u201d", "The shingle was burning an ordinary, cheerful orange. No trace of blue about it, but it could have been blue last night. I dropped the shingle and crushed it out with my boot.", "I circled the house again. Something was bothering me, but I couldn\u2019t put my finger on it. I wanted to go inside for a look around. \u201cThe fire really wasn\u2019t that bad,\u201d I called out to Denna. \u201cWhat did you end up leaving inside?\u201d", "\u201cNot that bad?\u201d she said incredulously, as she came around the corner. \u201cThe place is a husk.\u201d", "I pointed. \u201cThe roof isn\u2019t burned through except right by the chimney That means the fire probably didn\u2019t damage the second story very much. What of yours was in there?\u201d", "\u201cI had some clothes and a lyre Master Ash bought for me.\u201d", "\u201cYou play lyre?\u201d I was surprised. \u201cHow many strings?\u201d", "\u201cSeven. I\u2019m just learning.\u201d She gave a brief, humorless laugh. \u201cI was learning. I\u2019m good enough for a country wedding and that\u2019s about it.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t waste yourself on the lyre,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s an archaic instrument with no room for subtlety. Not to disparage your choice of instrument,\u201d I said quickly \u201cIt\u2019s just that your voice deserves better accompaniment than a lyre can give you. If you\u2019re looking for a straight-string instrument you can carry with you, go for a half-harp.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re sweet,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t pick it. Mr. Ash did. I\u2019ll push him for a harp next time.\u201d She looked around aimlessly and sighed. \u201cIf he\u2019s still alive.\u201d", "I peered in one of the gaping windows to look around, only to have a chunk of the windowsill snap off in my hands when I leaned on it. \u201cThis one\u2019s rotten through too.\u201d I said, crumbling it in my hands.", "\u201cExactly,\u201d Denna took hold of my arm and pulled me away from the window. \u201cThe place is just waiting to fall in on you. It\u2019s not worth going in. Like you said, it\u2019s just a lyre.\u201d", "I let myself be led away. \u201cYour patron\u2019s body might be up there.\u201d", "Denna shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019s not the sort to run into a burning building and get himself trapped.\u201d She gave me a hard look. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re going to find in there, anyway?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut if I don\u2019t go inside, I don\u2019t know where else to look for clues about what really happened here.\u201d", "\u201cWhat rumors did you hear, anyway?\u201d Denna asked.", "\u201cNot much,\u201d I admitted, thinking back to what the bargeman had said. \u201cA bunch of people were killed at a wedding. Everyone dead, torn apart like rag dolls. Blue fire.\u201d", "\u201cThey weren\u2019t really torn apart,\u201d Denna said. \u201cFrom what I heard in town, it was a lot of knife and sword work.\u201d", "I hadn\u2019t seen anyone wearing so much as a belt knife since I\u2019d been in town. The closest thing had been farmers with sickles and scythes in the fields. I looked back at the sagging farmhouse, sure that I was missing something....", "\u201cSo what do you think happened here?\u201d she asked.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cI was half expecting to find nothing. You know how rumors get blown out of proportion.\u201d I looked around. \u201cI would have written the blue fire off to rumor if you hadn\u2019t been here to confirm it.\u201d", "\u201cOther people saw it last night,\u201d she said. \u201cThings were still smoldering when they came for the bodies and found me.\u201d", "I looked around, irritated. I still felt like I was missing something, but I couldn\u2019t think of what in the world it could be. \u201cWhat do they think in town?\u201d I asked.", "\u201cFolk weren\u2019t really talkative around me,\u201d she said bitterly. \u201cBut I caught a bit of the conversation between the constable and the mayor. Folk are whispering about demons. The blue fire made sure of that. Some folk were talking about shamble-men. I expect the harvest festival will be more traditional than usual this year. Lots of fires and cider and straw men....\u201d", "I looked around again. The collapsed wreckage of the barn, a windmill with three fins, and a burned-out husk of a house. Frustrated I ran my hands through my hair, still sure I was missing something. I\u2019d expected to find ... something. Anything.", "As I stood there, it occurred to me how foolish the hope was. What had I hoped to find? A footprint? A scrap of cloth from someone\u2019s cloak? Some crumpled note with a vital piece of information conveniently written out for me to find? That sort of thing only happened in stories.", "I pulled out my water bottle and drank off the last of it. \u201cWell, I\u2019m done here,\u201d I said as I walked over to the water trough. \u201cWhat are you planning to do next?\u201d", "\u201cI need to look around a bit,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a chance my gentleman friend is out there, hurt.\u201d", "I looked out over the rolling hills, gold with autumn leaves and wheat fields, green with pasture and stands of pine and fir. Scattered throughout were the dark scars of bluffs and stone outcroppings. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of ground to cover....\u201d I said.", "She nodded, her expression resigned. \u201cI\u2019ve got to at least make an effort.\u201d", "\u201cWould you like some help?\u201d I asked. \u201cI know a little woodcraft....\u201d", "\u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t mind the company,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially considering the fact that there may be a troupe of marauding demons in these parts. Besides, you already offered to make me dinner tonight.\u201d", "\u201cThat I did.\u201d I made my way past the charred windmill to the iron hand pump. I grabbed the handle, leaned my weight against it, and staggered as it snapped off at the base.", "I stared at the broken pump handle. It was rusted through to the center, crumbling away in gritty sheets of red rust.", "In a sudden flash I remembered coming back to find my troupe killed that evening so many years ago. I remembered reaching out a hand to steady myself and finding the strong iron bands on a wagon\u2019s wheel rusted away. I remembered the thick, solid wood falling to pieces when I touched it.", "\u201cKvothe?\u201d Denna\u2019s face was close to mine, her expression concerned. \u201cAre you alright? Tehlu blacken, sit down before you fall down. Are you hurt?\u201d", "I moved to sit on the edge of the water trough, but the thick planking crumbled under my weight like a rotten stump. I let gravity pull me the rest of the way down and sat on the grass.", "I held the rusted-through pump handle up for Denna to see. She frowned at it. \u201cThat pump was new. The father was bragging about how much it had cost to get a well set up here at the top of the hill. He kept saying that no daughter of his would have to carry buckets uphill three times a day.\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you think happened here?\u201d I asked. \u201cTruthfully\u201d", "She looked around, the bruise on her temple a sharp contrast against her pale skin. \u201cI think when I\u2019m done looking for my patron to be, I\u2019m going to wash my hands of this place and never look back.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s not an answer,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat do you think happened?\u201d", "She looked at me for a long moment before responding. \u201cSomething bad. I\u2019ve never seen a demon, and I don\u2019t ever expect to. But I\u2019ve never seen the King of Vint either....\u201d", "\u201cDo you know that children\u2019s song?\u201d Denna looked at me blankly, so I sang:", "\u201cWhen the hearthfire turns to blue,", "What to do? What to do?", "Run outside. Run and hide.", "", "When your bright sword turns to rust?", "Who to trust? Who to trust?", "Stand alone. Standing stone.\u201d", "", "", "Denna grew paler as she realized what I was implying. She nodded and chanted the chorus softly to herself:", "See a woman pale as snow?", "Silent come and silent go.", "What\u2019s their plan? What\u2019s their plan?", "Chandrian. Chandrian.", "", "", "Denna and I sat in the patchwork shade of the autumn trees, out of sight of the ruined farm. Chandrian. The Chandrian were really here. I was still trying to collect my thoughts when she spoke.", "\u201cIs this what you were expecting to find?\u201d she asked.", "\u201cIt\u2019s what I was looking for,\u201d I said. The Chandrian were here less than a day ago. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t expect this. I mean, when you\u2019re a child and you go digging for buried treasure, you don\u2019t expect to find any You go looking for dennerlings and faeries in the forest, but you don\u2019t find them.\u201d They\u2019d killed my troupe, and they\u2019d killed this wedding party. \u201cHell, I go looking for you in Imre all the time, but I don\u2019t actually expect to find you....\u201d I trailed off, realizing that I was blathering.", "Some of the tension bled out of Denna as she laughed. There was no mocking in it, only amusement. \u201cSo am I lost treasure or a faeling?\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re both. Hidden, valuable, much sought and seldom found.\u201d I looked up at her, my mind hardly attending to what was coming out of my mouth. \u201cThere\u2019s much of the fae in you as well.\u201d They are real. The Chandrian were real. \u201cYou\u2019re never where I look for you, then you appear all unexpected. Like a rainbow.\u201d", "Over the last year I\u2019d held a silent fear in my secret heart. I worried at times that the memory of my troupe\u2019s death and the Chandrian had just been a strange sort of grief-dream my mind had created to help me deal with the loss of my entire world. But now I had something resembling proof. They were real. My memory was real. I wasn\u2019t crazy.", "\u201cWhen I was I child I chased a rainbow for an hour one evening. Got lost in the woods. My parents were frantic. I thought I could catch up to it. I could see where it should touch the ground. That\u2019s what you\u2019re....\u201d", "Denna touched my arm. I felt the sudden warmth of her hand through my shirt. I drew a deep breath and smelled the smell of her hair, warm with the sun, the smell of green grass and her clean sweat and her breath and apples. The wind sighed through the trees and lifted her hair so that it tickled my face.", "Only when sudden silence filled the clearing did I realize that I\u2019d been keeping up a steady stream of mindless chatter for several minutes. I flushed with embarrassment and looked around, suddenly remembering where I was.", "\u201cYou were a little wild around the eyes there,\u201d she said gently. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen you out of sorts before.\u201d", "I took another slow breath. \u201cI\u2019m out of sorts all the time,\u201d I said. \u201cI just don\u2019t show it.\u201d", "\u201cMy point exactly.\u201d She took a step back, her hand slowly sliding down the length of my arm until it fell away. \u201cSo what now?\u201d", "\u201cI ... I have no idea.\u201d I looked around aimlessly.", "\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like you either,\u201d she said.", "\u201cI\u2019d like a drink of water,\u201d I said, then gave a sheepish grin at how childish it sounded.", "She grinned back at me. \u201cThat\u2019s a good place to start,\u201d she teased. \u201cAfter that?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019d like to know why the Chandrian attacked here.\u201d", "\u201c What\u2019s their plan, eh?\u201d She looked serious. \u201cThere isn\u2019t much middle ground with you, is there? All you want is a drink of water and the answer to a question that folk have been guessing at since ... well, since forever.\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you think happened here?\u201d I asked. \u201cWho do you think killed these folks?\u201d", "She crossed her arms in front of her chest. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cIt could have been all manner of...\u201d She stopped, chewing on her lower lip. \u201cNo. That\u2019s a lie,\u201d she said at last. \u201cIt sounds strange to say, but I think it was them. It sounds like something out of a story, so I don\u2019t want to believe it. But I do.\u201d She looked at me nervously.", "\u201cThat makes me feel better.\u201d I stood up. \u201cI thought I might be a little crazy.\u201d", "\u201cYou still might be,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not a good touchstone to use for judging your sanity.\u201d", "\u201cDo you feel crazy?\u201d", "She shook her head, a half smile curling the corner of her mouth. \u201cNo. How about you?\u201d", "\u201cNot particularly\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s either good or bad, depending,\u201d she said. \u201cHow do you propose we go about solving the mystery of the ages?\u201d", "\u201cI need to think on it for a while,\u201d I said. \u201cIn the meantime, let\u2019s find your mysterious Master Ash. I\u2019d love to ask him a few questions about what he saw back at the Mauthen farm.\u201d", "Denna nodded. \u201cI was thinking I would head back to where he left me, behind that bluff, then look between there and the farm.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not much of a plan....\u201d", "\u201cIt gives us a place to start,\u201d I said. \u201cIf he came back and found you were gone, he might have left a trail that we could pick up.\u201d", "Denna led the way through the woods. It was warmer here. The trees kept the wind at bay but the sun could still peer through as many of the trees were nearly bare. Only the tall oaks were still holding all their leaves, like self-conscious old men.", "As we walked, I tried to think of what reason the Chandrian could have had for killing these people. Was there any similarity between this wedding party and my troupe?", "Someone\u2019s parents have been singing the entirely wrong sort of songs....", "\u201cWhat did you sing last night?\u201d I asked. \u201cFor the wedding.\u201d", "\u201cThe usual,\u201d Denna said, kicking through a pile of leaves. \u201cBright stuff. \u2018Pennywhistle.\u2019 \u2018Come Wash in the River.\u2019 \u2018Copper Bottom Pot.\u2019 \u201d She chuckled. \u201c \u2018Aunt Emme\u2019s Tub\u2019 ...\u201d", "\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d I said, aghast. \u201cAt a wedding?\u201d", "\u201cA drunk grandfather asked for it,\u201d she shrugged as she made her way though a thick tangle of yellowing banerbyre. \u201cThere were a few raised eyebrows, but not many. They\u2019re earthy folk around here.\u201d", "We walked a little longer in silence. The wind gusted in the high branches above us, but where we trudged along it was just a whisper. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard \u2018Come Wash\u2019 before....\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019d have thought ...\u201d Denna looked over her shoulder at me. \u201cAre you trying to trick me into singing for you?\u201d", "\u201cOf course.\u201d", "She turned and smiled warmly at me, her hair falling into her face. \u201cMaybe later. I\u2019ll sing for my supper.\u201d She led us around a tall outcrop of dark stone. It was chillier here, out of the sun. \u201cI think he left me here,\u201d she said, looking around uncertainly \u201cEverything looks different during the day.\u201d", "\u201cDo you want to search the route back toward the farm, or circle out from here?\u201d", "\u201cCircles,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you\u2019ll have to show me what I\u2019m supposed to be looking for. I\u2019m a city girl.\u201d", "I briefly showed her what little I knew of woodcraft. I showed her the sort of ground where a boot will leave a scuff or a print. I pointed out how the pile of leaves she had walked through were obviously disturbed, and how the branches of the banerbyre were broken and torn where she\u2019d struggled through.", "We stayed close together, as two pairs of eyes are better than one, and neither of us was eager to set off alone. We worked back and forth, making larger and larger arcs away from the bluff.", "After five minutes I began to sense the futility of it. There was just too much forest. I could tell that Denna quickly came to the same conclusion. The storybook clues we hoped to find once again failed to show themselves. There were no torn scraps of cloth clinging to branches, no deep bootprints or abandoned campsites. We did find mushrooms, acorns, mosquitoes, and raccoon scat cleverly concealed by pine needles.", "\u201cDo you hear water?\u201d Denna asked.", "I nodded. \u201cI could really do with a drink,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd a bit of a wash.\u201d", "We wandered wordlessly away from our search, neither one of us wanting to admit that we were eager to give it up, both of us feeling in our bones how pointless it was. We followed the sound of running water down the hill until we pushed through a thick stand of pine trees and came upon a lovely, deep stream about twenty feet across.", "There was no scent of foundry runoff in this water, so we drank and I topped off my water bottle.", "I knew the shape of stories. When a young couple comes to a river there is a definite shape to what will happen next. Denna would bathe on the other side of the nearby fir tree, out of sight on a sandy bit of shore. I would move off a discrete distance, out of sight, but within easy talking distance. Then ... something would happen. She would slip and turn her ankle, or cut her foot on a sharp stone, and I\u2019d be forced to rush over. And then ...", "But this was not a story of two young lovers meeting by the river. So I splashed some water on my face and changed into my clean shirt behind a tree. Denna dipped her head in the water to cool off. Her glistening hair was dark as ink until she wrung it out with her hands.", "Then we sat on a stone, dandling our feet in the water and enjoying each other\u2019s company as we rested. We shared an apple, passing it back and forth between bites, which is close to kissing, if you\u2019ve never kissed before.", "And, after some gentle goading, Denna sang for me. One verse of \u201cCome Wash,\u201d a verse I had never heard before, which I suspect she made up on the spot. I will not repeat it here, as she sang it to me, not to you. And since this is not the story of two young lovers meeting by the river, it has no particular place here, and I will keep it to myself.", "", "", ""], "CHAPTER SEVENTY-THREE": ["CHAPTER SEVENTY-THREE", "Pegs", "\nNot long after the apple was gone, Denna and I pulled our feet out of the water and gathered ourselves to leave. I considered leaving off my boots, as feet that can run bare over Tarbean\u2019s rooftops are in no danger of being hurt by the roughest forest floor. But I didn\u2019t want to appear uncivilized, so I pulled on my socks despite the fact that they were damp and clammy with sweat.", "I was lacing up my boot when I heard a faint noise off in the forest, out of sight behind a stand of thick pine trees.", "Quietly, I reached out to Denna, touched her shoulder lightly to get her attention, and held my finger to my lips.", "What? She mouthed silently.", "I moved closer, stepping carefully to make as little sound as possible. \u201cI think I hear something,\u201d I said, my head close to hers. \u201cI\u2019m going to go have a look.\u201d", "\u201cLike hell you are,\u201d she whispered, her face pale in the shadow of the pines. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what Ash said before he left last night. I\u2019ll be damned if you\u2019re going to disappear on me too.\u201d", "Before I could reply, I heard more movement through the trees. Brush rustling, the sharp snap of a dry pine branch. As the noises got louder, I could pick out the sound of something big breathing heavily. Then a low, animal grunt.", "Not human. Not the Chandrian. My relief was short-lived as I heard another grunt and some snuffling. A wild boar, probably heading for the river.", "\u201cGet behind me,\u201d I said to Denna. Most people don\u2019t realize how dangerous wild boars are, especially in the fall, when the males are fighting for dominance. Sympathy wouldn\u2019t be any good. I had no source, no link. I didn\u2019t have so much as a stout stick. Would it be distracted by the few apples I had left?", "The boar shouldered aside the low hanging boughs of the nearby pine, snuffling and huffing. It probably weighed twice as much as me. It gave a great guttural grunt as it looked up and saw us. It lifted its head, nose wriggling, trying to catch our scent.", "\u201cDon\u2019t run or it\u2019ll chase you,\u201d I said softly, stepping slowly in front of Denna. At a loss for anything better, I brought out my folding knife and worked it open with my thumb. \u201cJust back up and get into the river. They aren\u2019t good swimmers.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s dangerous,\u201d Denna said in a normal tone behind me. \u201cShe looks more curious than angry.\u201d She paused. \u201cNot that I don\u2019t appreciate your noble urges and all.\u201d", "At second glance I saw Denna was right. It was a sow, not a boar, and under a patina of mud it was the pink of a domestic pig, not the brown bristle of a wild one. Bored, it lowered its head and began to root around among the shrubbery below the pines.", "Only then did I realize I was poised in a sort of half-crouch, one hand out like a wrestler. In the other hand I held my pitiful folding knife, so small it needed several runs at halving a good-sized apple. Worst of all I was only wearing one boot. I looked ridiculous: crazy as Elodin on his worst day", "My face flushed hot and I knew I must be red as a beet. \u201cMerciful Tehlu, I feel like an idiot.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s rather flattering, actually,\u201d Denna said. \u201cWith the exception of some rather irritating posturing in bars, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever had anyone actually leap to my defense before.\u201d", "\u201cYes of course.\u201d I kept my eyes down as I tugged on my other sock and boot, too embarrassed to look her in the eye. \u201cIt\u2019s every girl\u2019s dream to be rescued from someone\u2019s pet pig.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d I looked up and saw some gentle amusement in her face, but no mocking. \u201cYou looked ... fierce. Like a wolf with all its hackles up,\u201d she stopped, looking up at my head. \u201cOr a fox, I suppose. You\u2019re too red for a wolf.\u201d", "I relaxed a bit. A bristling fox is better than a deranged, half-shod idiot.", "\u201cYou\u2019re holding your knife wrong though,\u201d she said matter-of-factly, nodding toward my hand. \u201cIf you actually stabbed anyone, your grip would slip and you\u2019d cut your own thumb.\u201d Reaching out, she took hold of my fingers and moved them slightly. \u201cIf you hold it like this, your thumb is safe. The down side is that you lose a lot of the mobility in your wrist.\u201d", "\u201cBeen in a lot of knife fights, have you?\u201d I asked, bemused.", "\u201cNot as many as you might think,\u201d she said with a sly smile. \u201cIt\u2019s another page out of that worn book you men are so fond of using to court us.\u201d She rolled her eyes, exasperated. \u201cI can\u2019t count the men who have tried to seduce me away from my virtue by teaching me how to defend it.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you wearing a knife,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d", "\u201cWhy would I wear a knife?\u201d Denna asked. \u201cI am a delicate blossom and all that. A woman who goes around wearing a knife is obviously looking for trouble.\u201d She reached deep into her pocket and brought out a long, slender piece of metal, glittering all along one edge. \u201cHowever a woman who carries a knife is ready for trouble. Generally speaking, it\u2019s easier to appear harmless. It\u2019s less trouble all around.\u201d", "Only the fact that she was so matter-of-fact kept me from being startled. Her knife wasn\u2019t much larger than mine, but hers wasn\u2019t a folding knife. It was a straight piece of metal, with thin leather wrapping the grip. It clearly wasn\u2019t designed for eating or performing odd jobs around the campfire. It looked more like one of the razor-sharp surgical knives from the Medica. \u201cHow do you keep that in your pocket without cutting yourself to shreds?\u201d I asked.", "Denna turned sideways so show me. \u201cMy pocket is slit all along the inside. It straps to my leg. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so flat. So you can\u2019t see I\u2019m wearing it.\u201d She gripped the leather handle and held her knife in front of her for me to see. \u201cLike this. You want to keep your thumb along the flat.\u201d", "\u201cAre you trying to seduce me away from my virtue by teaching me how to defend it?\u201d I asked.", "\u201cLike you have any virtue,\u201d she laughed. \u201cI\u2019m trying to keep you from cutting up your pretty hands the next time you have to save a girl from a pig.\u201d She cocked her head to the side. \u201cSpeaking of. Did you know that when you\u2019re angry your eyes\u2014\u201d", "\u201cLoo pegs!\u201d A voice came through the trees accompanied by the dull clank of a bell. \u201cPeg peg peg ...\u201d", "The great sow perked up and trotted back through the brush toward the sound of the voice. Denna took a moment to replace her knife while I picked up my travelsack. Following the pig through the trees, we spotted a man downstream with a half dozen large sows milling around him. There was an old bristling boar too, and a score of assorted piglets scampering underfoot.", "The swineherd eyed us suspiciously. \u201cHulloo!\u201d he shouted. \u201cDain\u2019t be afeerd. Tae wain\u2019t baet.\u201d", "He was lean and leathery from the sun, with a scraggling beard. His long stick had a crude bronze bell hanging from it, and he wore a tattered bag over one shoulder. He smelled better than you\u2019d probably expect, as ranging pigs keep themselves cleaner than those kept penned. Even if he had smelled like a penned pig, I couldn\u2019t really hold it against him, as I had no doubt smelled worse at various points in my life.", "\u201cOi taut Oi heard sommat daen tae water aways,\u201d he said, his accent so thick and oily you could almost taste it. My mother referred to it as a deep valley accent since you only found them in towns that didn\u2019t have much contact with the outside world. Even in small rural towns like Trebon, folk didn\u2019t have much of an accent these days. Living in Tarbean and Imre for so long, I hadn\u2019t heard a dialect this thick in years. The fellow must have grown up in a truly remote location, probably tucked far back into the mountains.", "He came up to where we stood, his weathered face grim as he squinted at us. \u201cWat are the tae o\u2019 yeh daen oot here?\u201d he said suspiciously. \u201cOi taut Oi heard sengen.\u201d", "\u201cAt twere meh coosin,\u201d I said, making a nod toward Denna. \u201cShae dae have a loovlie voice far scirlin, dain\u2019t shae?\u201d I held out my hand. \u201cOi\u2019m greet glad tae meet ye, sar.

She glanced up long enough to smile at the swineherd, then dropped her eyes again, making such a picture of awkward bashfulness that I was almost fooled myself.", "Schiem touched his forehead politely and nodded, \u201cPleased tae meet yeh, Dinnaeh. Oi hain\u2019t naever heard a voice sae loovlie in awl moi loif,\u201d he said, pushing his shapeless hat back onto his head a bit. When Denna still wouldn\u2019t meet his eye, he turned back to me.", "\u201cFoin looken herd.\u201d I nodded in the direction of the scattered pigs that were meandering through the trees.", "He shook his head, chuckling. \u201cNae a herd. Shep an\u2019 cows mak a herd. Pegs make a sounder.\u201d", "\u201cEs at soo?\u201d I said. \u201cEs there a chance, friend Schiem, that Oi moit buy a foin wee peg from yeh?

People in solitary jobs like shepherds or swineherds tend to either enjoy their own company, or be starved for conversation. I hoped Schiem was the latter. I needed information about the wedding and none of the people in town seemed likely to talk.", "I gave him a sly grin and dipped my hand into my travelsack, bringing out the bottle of brand I\u2019d bought from the tinker. \u201cOi\u2019ve even got a dram o\u2019 somethin\u2019 tae season et.

Scheim returned with the piglet neatly quartered.", "I passed around the bottle of brand while the pig cooked over the fire, smoking and dripping fat onto the coals. I made a show of drinking, just raising the bottle and wetting my mouth. Denna tipped it when it passed her by as well, and there was some rosy color in her cheeks afterward. Schiem was as good as his word, and since the wind was blowing, it wasn\u2019t too long before his nose was comfortably red.", "Schiem and I chatted about nothing in particular until the pig was crispy and crackling on the outside. The more I listened, the more Schiem\u2019s accent faded into the back of my awareness and I didn\u2019t need to concentrate so much on maintaining my own. By the time the pig was done, I was hardly aware of it at all.", "\u201cYou\u2019re roight handy wit a knife,\u201d I complimented Schiem. \u201cBut Oi\u2019m surprised you\u2019d gut the little fella roit here with tae pegs close by....\u201d", "He shook his head. \u201cPegs is vicious bastards.\u201d He pointed to one of the sows trotting over to the patch of ground where he\u2019d dressed the pig. \u201cSee?

Something solid.\u201d I turned back to face Denna. \u201cI think there\u2019s an old hill fort buried here.\u201d", "Denna thought about it for a moment. \u201cWhy would they call it barrow hill if there weren\u2019t real barrows?\u201d", "\u201cProbably because folk around here haven\u2019t ever seen a real barrow, just heard about them in stories.

The red and yellow of autumn leaves were breathtaking. I could see a few houses and barns scattered about, surrounded by golden fields, or pale green pieces of pasture with dots of white sheep. I could see the stream where Denna and I had dandled our feet.", "Looking north, I could see the bluffs Schiem had mentioned. The land looked rougher there.", "I nodded mostly to myself. \u201cYou can see thirty miles in every direction here. The only hill with a better view is that one.\u201d I pointed to a tall hill obscuring my view of the northern bluffs. \u201cAnd that one practically comes to a point. It\u2019s too narrow on top for any decent sized fortification.\u201d", "She looked around thoughtfully, then nodded. \u201cFair enough, you\u2019ve sold me. There was a hill fort here.

My only regret is that the clouds had blown in while we walked, leaving the sky flat and grey as slate.", "To the south I could see a handful of small farms. A few streams and narrow roads cut meandering paths through the trees. The western mountains were like a distant wall. To the south and east I could see smoke rising into the sky and the low, brown buildings of Trebon.", "Turning north I saw that what the swineherd had said was true. There were no signs of human habitation in that direction. No roads or farms or chimney smoke, just increasingly rough ground, exposed rock, and trees clinging to the bluffs.", "The only thing on the top of the hill was a handful of greystones. Three of the massive stones were stacked together to form a huge arch, like a massive doorway. The other two lay on their sides, as if lounging in the thick grass. I found their presence comforting, like the unexpected company of old friends.", "Denna sat on one of the fallen greystones as I stood looking out over the countryside.

On my next trip I gathered some sage and dug up a few wild onions I\u2019d noticed on the way up the hill.", "The rain came down hard, then tapered off as I started to make supper. I used my small cookpot to make a stew with the leftover pork from lunch, some carrots and potatoes, and the onions I\u2019d found. I seasoned it with salt, pepper, and sage, then warmed a loaf of flatbread near the fire and broke open the wax on the cheese. Last of all, I tucked two apples in among the hot rocks of the fire. They\u2019d be baked in time for dessert.", "By the time dinner was ready, Denna had amassed a small mountain of firewood. I spread out my blanket for her to sit on, and she made appreciative noises over the food as we set about eating.", "\u201cA girl could get used to this sort of treatment,\u201d Denna said after we\u2019d finished.

All in all, a very pleasant way to wake up.", "I was about to say something to that effect when she put her finger over my lips, distracting me in about eighteen different ways.", "\u201cQuiet,\u201d she said softly. \u201cListen.\u201d", "I sat up.", "\u201cDo you hear it?\u201d she asked after a moment.", "I cocked my head. \u201cJust the wind ...\u201d", "She shook her head and cut me off with a gesture. \u201cThere!\u201d", "I did hear it. At first I thought it was some disturbed rocks sliding down the hill, but no, this didn\u2019t fade into the distance like that would. It sounded more like something being dragged up the side of the hill.", "I got to my feet and looked around. While I\u2019d slept the clouds had blown away, and now the moon lit the surrounding countryside in pale silver light. Our wide firepit was brim full of shimmering coals.", "Just then, not far down the hillside, I heard ... to say I heard a branch breaking would mislead you. When a person moving through the woods breaks a branch, it makes a short, sharp snap. This is because any branch a man breaks accidentally is small and breaks quickly.", "What I heard was no twig snapping. It was a long cracking sound. The sound a leg-thick branch makes when it\u2019s torn from a tree: kreek-kerrrka-krraakkk.", "Then, as I turned to look at Denna, I heard the other noise. How can I describe it?", "When I was young my mother took me to see a menagerie in Senarin. It was the only time I had ever seen a lion, and the only time I had heard one roar. The other children in the crowd were frightened, but I laughed, delighted. The sound was so deep and low that I could feel it rumble in my chest. I loved the feeling and remember it to this day.", "The sound I heard on the hill near Trebon was not a lion\u2019s roar, but I felt it in my chest the same way It was a grunt, deeper than a lion\u2019s roar. Closer to the sound of thunder in the distance.", "Another branch broke, almost on the crest of the hill. I looked in that direction and saw a huge shape dimly lined by the firelight. I felt the ground shudder slightly under my feet. Denna turned to look at me, her eyes wide with panic.", "I grabbed hold of her arm and ran toward the opposite side of the hill. Denna kept up with me at first, then planted her feet when she saw where I was headed. \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d she hissed. \u201cWe\u2019ll break our necks if we run down that in the dark.\u201d She cast around wildly, then looked up at the nearby greystones. \u201cGet me up there and I\u2019ll haul you up after.\u201d", "I laced my fingers together to make a step. She put her foot into it, and I heaved so hard I almost threw her into the air where she could catch the edge of the stone. I waited a brief moment until she swung her leg up, then I slung my travelsack over my shoulder, and scrambled up the side of the massive stone.", "Rather I should say I scrambled at the side of the massive stone. It was worn smooth by ages of weather and didn\u2019t have any handholds to speak of. I slid to the ground, my hands scrabbling ineffectually", "I bolted to the other side of the arch, hopped up onto one of the lower stones, and made another leap.", "I hit the rock hard, all along the front of my body, knocking the wind out of me and banging my knee. My hands gripped at the top of the arch, but I couldn\u2019t find any purchase\u2014", "Denna caught me. If this were some heroic ballad, I would tell you how she clasped my hand firmly and pulled me to safety. But the truth is she got hold of my shirt with one hand while the other made a tight fist in my hair. She hauled hard and kept me from falling long enough for me to catch a grip and scramble to the top of the stone with her.", "As we lay there, panting, we peered over the edge of the stone. Down on the hilltop, the dim shape was beginning to move into the circle of our firelight. Half hidden in the shadows, it looked larger than any animal I had ever seen, big as a loaded wagon. It was black, with a massive body like a bull\u2019s. It came closer, moving in an odd shuffle, not like a bull or a horse. The wind fanned the fire, causing it to flare up, and I saw it carried its thick body close to the ground, legs out to the side, like a lizard.", "When it came farther into the light the comparison was impossible to avoid. It was a huge lizard. Not long like a snake, it was squat like a cinder brick, its thick neck blending into a head shaped like a massive flat wedge.", "It covered half the distance from the crest of the hill to our fire in a single, spastic burst of speed. It grunted again, deep like rumbling thunder, and I felt it in my chest. As it came closer it moved past the other greystone that lay in the grass, and I realized my eyes weren\u2019t playing tricks on me. It was bigger than the greystone. Six feet high at the shoulder, fifteen feet long. Big as a horsecart. Massive as a dozen bulls tied together.", "It moved its thick head back and forth working its wide mouth open and closed, tasting the air.", "Then there was a burst of blue flame. The sudden light of it was blinding, and I heard Denna cry out beside me. I ducked my head and felt a wash of heat roll over us.", "Rubbing at my eyes, I looked down again and saw the thing move closer to the fire. It was black, scaled, massive.

The metal slowly filters into the bones and scales.\u201d I took the scale and walked over to one of the greystones. \u201cYear after year it sheds its skin, then eats it, keeping the iron in its system. After two hundred years ...\u201d I tapped the scale against the stone.

We had to climb or go the long way around, sometimes doubling back before we found a way through.", "And there were distractions. We stumbled onto a patch of ripe ashberry that slowed us down for almost a full hour. Not long after that we found a stream and stopped to drink and rest and wash.

Not ideal for proper bathing.", "It was early afternoon before we finally came to the source of the smoke, and what we found was not at all what we expected.", "", "It was a secluded valley tucked into the bluffs. I say valley, but in truth it was more like a gigantic step among the foothills. On one side was a high cliff wall of dark rock, and on the other was a sheer drop-off. Denna and I came at it from two different, unapproachable angles before we finally found a way in. Luckily the day was windless, and the smoke rose straight as an arrow into the clear blue sky If not for that to guide us, we probably never would have found the place.", "Once it had probably been a pleasant little piece of forest, but now it looked like it had been struck by a tornado. Trees were broken, uprooted, charred, and smashed. Huge furrows of exposed earth and rock were dug everywhere, as if some giant farmer had gone raving mad while plowing his field.", "Two days ago I wouldn\u2019t have been able to guess what would cause such destruction. But after what I had seen last night....", "\u201cI thought you said they were harmless?\u201d Denna said, turning to me. \u201cIt went on a rampage here.\u201d", "Denna and I began to pick our way through the wreckage. The white smoke rose from the deep hole left by a large maple tree that had been tipped over. The fire was nothing more than a few coals smouldering in the bottom of the hole where the roots had been.", "I idly kicked a few more clods of dirt into the hole with the toe of my boot. \u201cWell, the good news is that your patron isn\u2019t here. The bad news is...\u201d I broke off, drawing a deeper breath. \u201cDo you smell that?\u201d", "Denna took a deep breath and nodded, wrinkling her nose.", "I climbed up onto the side of the fallen maple and looked around. The wind shifted and the smell grew stronger, something dead and rotten.", "\u201cI thought you said they don\u2019t eat meat,\u201d Denna said, looking around nervously.", "I hopped down from the tree and made my way back to the cliff wall. There was a small log cabin there, smashed to flinders. The rotting smell was stronger.", "\u201cOkay,\u201d Denna said, looking over the wreckage. \u201cThis does not look harmless at all.\u201d", "\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the draccus was responsible for this,\u201d I said. \u201cIf the Chandrian attacked here, the draccus could have been lured by the fire and caused the destruction while putting it out.\u201d", "\u201cYou think the Chandrian did this?\u201d she asked. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t fit with anything I\u2019ve ever heard of them. They\u2019re supposed to strike like lightning then disappear. They don\u2019t visit, set some fires, then come back later to run a few errands.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know what to think. But two destroyed houses....\u201d I began to sift through the wreckage. \u201cIt seems reasonable that they\u2019re related.\u201d", "Denna drew in a sharp breath. I followed her line of sight and saw the arm protruding from under several heavy logs.", "I moved closer. Flies buzzed up and I covered my mouth a bit in a futile attempt to stave off the smell. \u201cHe\u2019s been dead for about two span.\u201d I bent and picked up a tangle of shattered wood and metal. \u201cLook at this.\u201d", "\u201cBring it here and I\u2019ll look at it.\u201d", "I brought it back to where she stood. The thing was broken almost beyond recognition. \u201cCrossbow.\u201d", "\u201cDidn\u2019t do him much good,\u201d she said.", "\u201cThe question is why did he have it in the first place?\u201d I looked at the thick piece of blue steel that made the crossbar. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t some hunting bow. This is what you use to kill a man in armor from across a field. They\u2019re illegal.\u201d", "Denna snorted. \u201cThose sorts of laws don\u2019t get enforced out here. You know that.\u201d", "I shrugged. \u201cThe fact remains that this was an expensive piece of machinery. Why would someone living in a tiny cabin with a dirt floor own a crossbow worth ten talents?\u201d", "\u201cMaybe he knew about the draccus,\u201d Denna said looking around nervously. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind a crossbow right about now.\u201d", "I shook my head. \u201cDraccus are shy. They stay away from people.\u201d", "Denna gave me a frank look, gesturing sarcastically at the wreckage of the cabin.", "\u201cThink about every wild creature in the forest,\u201d I said. \u201cAll wild creatures avoid contact with people. Like you said, you\u2019ve never even heard of the draccus. There\u2019s a reason for that.\u201d", "\u201cMaybe it\u2019s rabid?\u201d", "That brought me up short. \u201cThat\u2019s a terrifying thought.\u201d I looked around at the ruined landscape. \u201cHow on earth would you put something like that down? Can a lizard even catch the froth?\u201d", "Denna shifted uncomfortably from one foot to the other, looking around nervously \u201cIs there anything else you\u2019d like to look at here? Because I\u2019m done with this place. I don\u2019t want to be here when that thing gets back.\u201d", "\u201cPart of me feels like we should give this fellow a decent burial....\u201d", "Denna shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not staying here that long. We can tell someone in town and they can take care of it. It could come back any minute.\u201d", "\u201cBut why?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy does it keep coming back here?\u201d I pointed. \u201cThat tree\u2019s been dead for a span of days, but that one just got torn up a couple days ago....\u201d", "\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d Denna asked.", "\u201cThe Chandrian,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cI want to know why they were here. Do they control the draccus?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t think they were here,\u201d Denna said. \u201cAt the Mauthen farm, maybe. But this is just the work of a rabid cow-lizard.\u201d She gave me a long look, searching my face. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you came here looking for. But I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to find it.\u201d", "I shook my head, looking around. \u201cI feel like this has to be connected to the farm.\u201d", "\u201cI think you want it to be connected,\u201d she said gently. \u201cBut this fellow\u2019s been dead a long while. You said so yourself. And remember the doorframe and the water trough at the farm?\u201d She bent down and rapped a knuckle against one of the logs from the ruined cabin. It made a solid sound. \u201cAnd look at the crossbow\u2014the metal isn\u2019t rusted away. They weren\u2019t here.\u201d", "I felt my heart sink in my chest. I knew she was right. Deep down I knew I\u2019d been grasping at straws. Still, it felt wrong giving up without trying everything possible.", "Denna took hold of my hand. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go.\u201d She smiled and tugged on me. Her hand was cool and smooth in my own. \u201cThere\u2019s more interesting things to do than hunt....\u201d", "There was a loud splintering noise off in the trees: kkkrek-ke-krrk. Denna dropped my hand and turned to face the way we\u2019d come. \u201cNo ...\u201d she said. \u201cNo no no ...\u201d", "The sudden threat of the draccus brought me back into focus. \u201cWe\u2019re fine,\u201d I said looking around. \u201cIt can\u2019t climb. It\u2019s too heavy.\u201d", "\u201cClimb what? A tree? It\u2019s been knocking those down for fun!\u201d", "\u201cThe bluffs.\u201d I pointed to the cliff wall that bordered this little section of forest. \u201cCome on ...\u201d", "We scrambled to the base of the cliff, stumbling through furrows and jumping over fallen trees. Behind us I heard the rumbling, thunderlike grunt. I darted a glance over my shoulder, but the draccus was still somewhere among the trees.", "We got to the base of the cliff and I started searching for a section both of us could climb. After a long frantic minute we emerged from a thick patch of sumac to find a swath of wildly churned-up dirt. The draccus had been digging there.", "\u201cLook!\u201d Denna pointed to a break in the cliff, a deep crack about two feet across. It was wide enough for a person to squeeze through, but too narrow for the huge lizard. There were sharp claw marks on the cliff wall and broken rocks scattered around the churned-up earth.", "Denna and I squeezed into the narrow gap. It was dark, the only light coming from the narrow strip of blue sky high overhead. As I crept along I was forced to turn sideways in places to make it through. When I brought my hands away from the walls my palms were covered in black soot. Unable to dig its way in, apparently the draccus had breathed fire down into the narrow passage.", "After only a dozen feet, the crevasse widened slightly \u201cThere\u2019s a ladder,\u201d Denna said. \u201cI\u2019m going up. If that thing breathes fire at us it will be like rainwater down a gully.\u201d", "She climbed and I followed her. The ladder was crude but sturdy, and after twenty feet it opened out onto a piece of level ground. Dark stone surrounded us on three sides, but there was a clear view of the ruined cabin and the destroyed trees below. A wooden box was set against the cliff wall.", "\u201cCan you see it?\u201d Denna asked, peering down. \u201cTell me I didn\u2019t just skin my knees running from nothing.\u201d", "I heard a dull whump and I felt a wave of hot air rise up against my back.", "The draccus grunted again, and another wash of fire ran through the narrow gap below. Then there came a sudden, furious sound like nails on a slate as the draccus clawed madly against the base of the cliff.", "Denna gave me a frank look. \u201cHarmless.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not after us,\u201d I said. \u201cYou saw It was digging at that wall long before we ever got here.\u201d", "Denna sat down. \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d", "\u201cSome sort of lookout,\u201d I said. \u201cYou can see the whole valley from here.\u201d", "\u201cObviously it\u2019s a lookout,\u201d she sighed. \u201cI\u2019m talking about the whole place.\u201d", "I opened the wooden box that was up against the cliff wall. Inside was a rough wool blanket, a full waterskin, some dried meat, and a dozen wickedly sharp crossbow bolts.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know either,\u201d I admitted. \u201cMaybe the fellow was a fugitive.\u201d", "The noise stopped below. Denna and I peered out over the ruined valley. Eventually the draccus moved away from the cliff. It walked slowly, its huge body digging an irregular rut into the ground.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not moving as quickly as it did last night,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe it is sick.\u201d", "\u201cMaybe it\u2019s tired from a hard day\u2019s trying to track us down and kill us.\u201d She looked up at me. \u201cSit down. You\u2019re making me nervous. We\u2019re not going anywhere for a while.\u201d", "I sat down and we watched the draccus make its plodding way to the middle of the valley. It went up to a tree about thirty feet tall and pushed it over without any noticeable effort.", "Then it began to eat it, leaves first. Next it crunched up branches thick as my wrist as easily as a sheep would tear up a mouthful of grass. When the trunk was finally stripped bare, I assumed it would have to stop. But it simply clamped its huge, flat mouth down on one end of the trunk and twisted its massive neck. The trunk splintered and broke, leaving the draccus with a large but manageable mouthful that it bolted down more or less whole.", "Denna and I took the opportunity to eat some lunch of our own. Just some flatbread, sausage, and the rest of my carrots. I was hesitant to trust the food in the box, as there was the distinct possibility that the fellow living here had been some manner of crazy.", "\u201cIt still amazes me that no one around here has ever seen it,\u201d Denna said.", "\u201cPeople have probably caught glimpses,\u201d I said. \u201cThe swineherd said everyone knows there\u2019s something dangerous in these woods. They probably just assumed it was a demon or some nonsense like that.\u201d", "Denna glanced back at me, an amused curl to her mouth. \u201cSays the fellow who came to town looking for the Chandrian.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s different,\u201d I protested hotly. \u201cI don\u2019t go around spouting faerie stories and touching iron. I\u2019m here so I can learn the truth. So I can have information that comes from somewhere more reliable than thirdhand stories.\u201d", "\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to touch a nerve,\u201d Denna said, taken aback. She looked back down below. \u201cIt really is an incredible animal.\u201d", "\u201cWhen I read about it I didn\u2019t really believe about the fire,\u201d I admitted. \u201cIt seemed a little far-fetched to me.\u201d", "\u201cMore far-fetched than a lizard big as a horse cart?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s just a matter of size. But fire isn\u2019t a natural thing. If nothing else, where does it keep the fire? It\u2019s obviously not burning inside.\u201d", "\u201cDidn\u2019t they explain it in that book you read?\u201d Denna asked", "\u201cThe author had some guesses, but that\u2019s all. He couldn\u2019t catch one to dissect it.\u201d", "\u201cUnderstandable,\u201d Denna said as she watched the draccus casually nudge over another tree and begin eating that one as well. \u201cWhat sort of a net or a cage would hold it?\u201d", "\u201cHe had some interesting theories though,\u201d I said. \u201cYou know how cow manure gives off a gas that burns?\u201d", "Denna turned to look at me and laughed. \u201cNo. Really?\u201d", "I nodded, grinning. \u201cFarm kids will strike sparks onto a fresh cow pat and watch it burn. That\u2019s why farmers have to be careful about storing manure. The gas can build up and explode.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m a city girl,\u201d she said chuckling. \u201cWe didn\u2019t play those sorts of games.\u201d", "\u201cYou missed some big fun,\u201d I said. \u201cThe author suggested that the draccus just stores that gas in a bladder of some kind. The real question is how it lights the gas. The author has a clever idea about arsenic. Which makes sense, chemically. Arsenic and coal gas will explode if you put them together. That\u2019s how you get marsh lights in swamps. But I think that\u2019s a little unreasonable. If it had that much arsenic in its body, it would poison itself.\u201d", "\u201cMmmm-hmm,\u201d Denna said, still watching the draccus below.", "\u201cBut if you think about it, all it needs is a tiny spark to ignite the gas,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd there are plenty of animals that can create enough galvanic force for a spark. Clip eels, for example, can generate enough to kill a man, and they\u2019re only a couple of feet long.\u201d I gestured toward the draccus. \u201cSomething that big could certainly generate enough for a spark.\u201d", "I was hoping that Denna would be impressed by my ingenuity, but she seemed distracted by the scene below.", "\u201cYou\u2019re not really listening to me, are you?\u201d", "\u201cNot so much,\u201d she said, turning to me and giving a smile. \u201cI mean, it makes perfect sense to me. It eats wood. Wood burns. Why wouldn\u2019t it breathe fire?\u201d", "While I tried to think of a response to that, she pointed down into the valley \u201cLook at the trees down there. Do they look odd to you?\u201d", "\u201cAside from being destroyed and mostly eaten?\u201d I asked. \u201cNot particularly.\u201d", "\u201cLook how they\u2019re arranged. It\u2019s hard to see because the place is a shambles, but it looks like they were growing in rows. Like someone planted them.\u201d", "Now that she pointed it out, it did look like a large section of the trees had been in rows before the draccus came. A dozen rows with a score of trees each. Most of them were now only stumps or empty holes.", "\u201cWhy would someone plant trees in the middle of a forest?\u201d She mused. \u201cIt\u2019s not an orchard.... Did you see any fruit?\u201d", "I shook my head.", "\u201cAnd those trees are the only ones the draccus has been eating,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s the big clear spot in the middle. The others he knocks down, but those he knocks down and eats.\u201d She squinted. \u201cWhat kind of tree is it eating right now?\u201d", "\u201cI can\u2019t tell from here,\u201d I said. \u201cMaple? Does it have a sweet tooth?\u201d", "We looked for a while longer, then Denna got to her feet. \u201cWell, the important thing is that it\u2019s not going to run over and breathe fire down our backs. Let\u2019s go see what\u2019s at the other end of that narrow path. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s a way out of here.\u201d", "We headed down the ladder and made our slow, winding way along the bottom of the tiny crevasse. It twisted and turned for another twenty feet before opening up into a tiny box canyon with steep walls rising away on every side.", "There was no way out, but it was obviously being put to some use. The place had been cleared of plants, leaving a packed dirt floor. Two long fire pits had been dug, and resting over the pits on brick platforms were large metal pans. They almost resembled the rendering vats that knackers use for tallow. But these were wide, flat, and shallow, like baking pans for enormous pies.", "\u201cIt does have a sweet tooth!\u201d Denna laughed. \u201cThis fellow was making maple candy here. Or syrup.\u201d", "I moved closer to look. There were buckets laying around, of the sort that could carry maple sap so it could be boiled down. I opened the door of a tiny ramshackle shed and saw more buckets, long wooden paddles for stirring the sap, scrapers for getting it out of the pans....", "But it didn\u2019t feel right. There were plenty of maple trees in the forest. It didn\u2019t make sense to cultivate them. And why pick such an out-of-the-way place?", "Maybe the fellow was simply crazy. Idly, I picked up one of the scrapers and looked at it. The edge was smeared dark, like it had been scraping tar....", "\u201cEech!\u201d Denna said behind me. \u201cBitter. I think they burned it.\u201d", "I turned around and saw Denna standing by one of the firepits. She had pried a large disk of sticky material out of the bottom of one of the pans and taken a bite out of it. It was black, not the deep amber color of maple candy.", "I suddenly realized what was really going on here. \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d", "She looked at me, puzzled. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad.\u201d She said, her words muffled through her sticky mouthful. \u201cIt\u2019s strange, but not really unpleasant.\u201d", "I stepped over to her knocked it out of her hand. Her eyes flashed angrily at me. \u201cSpit it out!\u201d I snapped. \u201cNow! It\u2019s poison!\u201d", "Her expression went from angry to terrified in a flash. She opened her mouth and let the wad of dark stuff fall to the ground. Then she spat, her saliva thick and black. I pressed my water bottle into her hands. \u201cRinse your mouth out,\u201d I said. \u201cRinse and spit it out.\u201d", "She took the bottle, and then I remembered it was empty. We\u2019d finished it during lunch.", "I took off running, scrambling through the narrow passage. I darted up the ladder, grabbed the waterskin, then down and back to the small canyon.", "Denna was sitting on the canyon floor, looking very pale and wide-eyed. I thrust the waterskin into her hands and she gulped so quickly that she choked, then gagged a bit as she spat it out.", "I reached into the fire pit, pushing my hand deep into the ashes until I found the unburned coals underneath. I brought up a handful of unburned charcoal. I shook my hand, scattering most of the ashes away, then thrust the handful of black coals at her. \u201cEat this,\u201d I said.", "She looked at me blankly.", "\u201cDo it!\u201d I shook the handful of coals at her. \u201cIf you don\u2019t chew this up and swallow it, I\u2019ll knock you out and force it down your throat!\u201d I put some in my own mouth. \u201cLook, it\u2019s fine. Just do it.\u201d My tone softened, became more pleading than commanding. \u201cDenna, trust me.\u201d", "She took some coals and put them in her mouth. Face pale and eyes beginning to brim with tears, she gritted up a mouthful and took a drink of water to wash it down, grimacing.", "\u201cThey\u2019re harvesting Goddamn ophalum here,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m an idiot for not seeing it sooner.\u201d", "Denna started to say something, but I cut her off. \u201cDon\u2019t talk. Keep eating. As much as you can stomach.\u201d", "She nodded solemnly, her eyes wide. She chewed, choked a little, and swallowed the charcoal with another mouthful of water. She ate a dozen mouthfuls in quick succession, then rinsed her mouth out again.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s ophalum?\u201d she asked softly.", "\u201cA drug. Those are denner trees. You just had a whole mouthful of denner resin.\u201d I sat down next to her. My hands were shaking. I lay them flat against my legs to hide it.", "She was quiet at that. Everyone knew about denner resin. In Tarbean the knackers had to come for the stiff bodies of sweet-eaters that overdosed in the Dockside alleys and doorways.", "\u201cHow much did you swallow?\u201d I asked.", "\u201cI was just chewing it, like toffee.\u201d Her face went pale again. \u201cThere\u2019s still some stuck in my teeth.\u201d", "I touched the waterskin. \u201cKeep rinsing.\u201d She swished the water from cheek to cheek before spitting and repeating the process. I tried to guess at how much of the drug she\u2019d gotten into her system, but there were too many variables, I didn\u2019t know how much she had swallowed, how refined this resin was, if the farmers had taken any steps to filter or purify it.", "Her mouth worked as her tongue felt around her teeth. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m clean.\u201d", "I forced a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re anything but clean,\u201d I said. \u201cYour mouth is all black. You look like a kid that\u2019s been playing in the coal bin.\u201d", "\u201cYou aren\u2019t much better,\u201d she said. \u201cYou look like a chimney sweep.\u201d She reached out to touch my bare shoulder. I must have torn my shirt against the rocks in my rush to get the waterskin. She gave a wan smile that didn\u2019t touch her frightened eyes at all. \u201cWhy do I have a belly full of coals?\u201d", "\u201cCharcoal is like a chemical sponge,\u201d I said. \u201cIt soaks up drugs and poisons.\u201d", "She brightened a little. \u201cAll of them?\u201d", "I considered lying, then thought better of it. \u201cMost. You got it into you pretty quickly. It will soak up a lot of what you swallowed.\u201d", "\u201cHow much?\u201d", "\u201cAbout six parts in ten,\u201d I said. \u201cHopefully a little more. How do you feel?\u201d", "\u201cScared,\u201d she said. \u201cShaky But other than that, no different.\u201d She shifted nervously where she sat and put her hand on the sticky disk of resin I\u2019d knocked away from her earlier. She flicked it away and wiped her hand nervously on her pants. \u201cHow long will it be before we know?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know how much they refined it,\u201d I said. \u201cIf it\u2019s still raw, it will take longer to work its way into your system. Which is good, as the effects will be spread out over a longer period of time.\u201d", "I felt for her pulse in her neck. It was racing, which didn\u2019t tell me anything. Mine was racing too. \u201cLook up here.\u201d I gestured with my raised hand and watched her eyes. Her pupils were sluggish responding to the light. I lay my hand on her head and under the pretext of lifting her eyelid a little, I pressed my finger against the bruise on her temple, hard. She didn\u2019t flinch or show the least hint that it pained her.", "\u201cI thought I was imagining it before,\u201d Denna said, looking up at me. \u201cBut your eyes really do change color. Normally they\u2019re bright green with a ring of gold around the inside....\u201d", "\u201cI got them from my mother,\u201d I said.", "\u201cBut I\u2019ve been watching. When you broke the pump handle yesterday they went dull green, muddy. And when the swineherd made that comment about the Ruh they went dark for just a moment. I thought it was just the light, but now I can see it\u2019s not.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m surprised you noticed,\u201d I said. \u201cThe only other person to ever point it out was an old teacher of mine. And he was an arcanist, which means it\u2019s pretty much his job to notice things.\u201d", "\u201cWell it\u2019s my job to notice things about you.\u201d She cocked her head a bit. \u201cPeople probably are distracted by your hair. It\u2019s so bright. It\u2019s pretty.... pretty distracting. And your face is really expressive. You\u2019re always in control of it, even the way your eyes behave. But not the color.\u201d She gave a faint smile. \u201cThey\u2019re pale now. Like green frost. You must be terribly afraid.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m guessing it\u2019s old-fashioned lust,\u201d I said in my roughest tones. \u201cIt\u2019s not often a beautiful girl lets me get this close to her.\u201d", "\u201cYou always tell me the most beautiful lies,\u201d she said, looking away from me and down to her hands. \u201cAm I going to die?\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d", "\u201cCould ...\u201d she looked up at me and smiled again, her eyes wet but not overflowing. \u201cCould you just say it out loud for me?\u201d", "\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to die,\u201d I said, getting to my feet. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s see if our lizard friend is gone yet.\u201d", "I wanted to keep her moving around and distracted, so we each had another little drink and headed back to the lookout.

I could use every penny ...\u201d I trailed off, my mind working.", "Denna looked at me, and I could see her mind jumping to the same conclusion. \u201cDo you know how much that much resin would be worth?\u201d she asked.", "\u201cNot really,\u201d I said thinking about the thirty pans, each with a wafer of black, sticky resin congealed in the bottom, big as a dinner plate. \u201cI\u2019m guessing a lot. An awful lot.\u201d", "Denna shifted back and forth on her feet. \u201cKvothe, I don\u2019t know how I feel about this. I\u2019ve seen girls get hooked on this stuff. I need money\u201d She gave a bitter laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t even have a second set of clothes right now.\u201d She looked worried. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if I need it this badly.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m thinking of apothecaries,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cThey\u2019d refine it into medicine. It\u2019s a powerful painkiller. The price won\u2019t be nearly as good as if we went to the other sort of people, but still, half a loaf....\u201d", "Denna smiled broadly. \u201cI\u2019d love half a loaf. Especially since my cryptic prick of a patron seems to have disappeared.\u201d", "We headed back down into the canyon. This time as I emerged from the narrow passageway, I saw the evaporating pans in a different light. Now each of them was the equivalent of a heavy coin in my pocket. Next term\u2019s tuition, new clothes, freedom from my debt with Devi....", "I saw Denna looking at the trays with the same fascination, though hers was somewhat more glassy-eyed than mine. \u201cI could live comfortably for a year off this,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd not be beholden to anyone.\u201d", "I went to the tool shed and grabbed a scraper for each of us. At the end of a few minutes work we had combined all of the black, sticky pieces into a single wad the size of a sweetmelon.", "She shivered a bit, then looked at me, smiling. Her cheeks were flushed. \u201cI suddenly feel really good.\u201d She crossed her arms across her chest, rubbing her hands up and down. \u201cReally, really good. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just the thought of all that money.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s the resin,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good sign that it\u2019s taken this long to hit you. I\u2019d have been worried if it had happened sooner.\u201d I gave her a serious look. \u201cNow listen. You need to let me know if you feel any heaviness in your chest, or have any trouble breathing. So long as neither of those things happens, you should be fine.\u201d", "Denna nodded, then drew a deep breath and let it out again. \u201cSweet angel Ordal above, I feel great.\u201d She gave me an anxious expression, but the wide grin kept spilling out. \u201cAm I going to get addicted from this?\u201d", "I shook my head and she sighed with relief. \u201cYou know the damnedest thing? I\u2019m scared about getting addicted, but I don\u2019t care that I\u2019m scared. I\u2019ve never felt like this before. No wonder our big scaly friend keeps coming back for more....\u201d", "\u201cMerciful Tehlu,\u201d I said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even think of that. That\u2019s why it was trying to claw its way in here. It can smell the resin. It\u2019s been eating the trees for two span, three or four a day.\u201d", "\u201cThe biggest sweet-eater of them all, coming back to get his fix.\u201d Denna laughed, then her expression went horrified. \u201cHow many trees were left?\u201d", "\u201cTwo or three,\u201d I said, thinking of the rows of empty holes and broken stumps. \u201cBut it may have eaten another since we\u2019ve been back here.\u201d", "\u201cHave you ever seen a sweet-eater when they\u2019ve got the hunger on them?\u201d Denna said, her face stricken. \u201cThey go crazy.\u201d", "\u201cI know,\u201d I said, thinking of the girl I\u2019d seen in Tarbean dancing naked in the snow.", "\u201cWhat do you think it\u2019s going to do when the trees run out?\u201d", "I thought for a long moment. \u201cIt\u2019s going to go looking for more.

We\u2019re going to have to kill it.\u201d", "\u201cKill it?\u201d She laughed, then pressed her hands against her mouth again. \u201cWith nothing but my good singing voice and your manly bravado?\u201d She started to giggle uncontrollably, despite the fact that she was holding both her hands in front of her mouth. \u201cGod, I\u2019m sorry Kvothe. How long am I going to be like this?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know. The effects of ophalum are euphoria ...\u201d", "\u201cCheck.\u201d She winked at me, grinning.", "\u201cFollowed by mania, some delirium if your dose was high enough, then exhaustion.\u201d", "\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll sleep through the night for once,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t seriously expect to kill this thing.

Stirring paddles, buckets, scrapers, spade, more buckets, a barrel....", "The barrel was about the size of a small keg of ale. I carried it outside the shed and pried off the lid. In the bottom was an oilcloth sack containing a large gummy mass of black denner resin, at least four times as much as Denna and I had already scraped together.", "I pulled out the sack and rested it on the ground, holding it open for Denna to look. She peered in, gasped, then jumped up and down a little bit. \u201cNow I can buy a pony!\u201d she said, laughing.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know about a pony,\u201d I said, doing some calculations in my head. \u201cBut I think before we split up the money, we should buy you a good half-harp out of this,\u201d I said. \u201cNot some sad lyre.\u201d", "\u201cYes!\u201d Denna said, then she threw her arms around me in a wild, delighted hug. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll get you ...\u201d She looked at me curiously, her sooty face inches away from my own. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d", "Before I could say anything, do anything, the draccus roared.", "", "", ""], "CHAPTER SEVENTY-EIGHT": ["CHAPTER SEVENTY-EIGHT", "Poison", "\nThe roar of the draccus was like a trumpet, if you can imagine a trumpet big as a house, and made of stone, and thunder, and molten lead.

The top of Denna\u2019s head banged into my nose, and I staggered, blinded with pain. Denna didn\u2019t notice, as she was busy tripping and falling over into a loose, laughing tangle of arms and legs.", "As I helped Denna to her feet I heard a distant crashing, and we made our way carefully back up to the lookout.", "The draccus was ... cavorting, bounding around like a drunken dog, knocking over trees like a boy would topple cornstalks in a field.", "I watched breathlessly as it came to an ancient oak tree, a hundred years old and massive as a greystone. The draccus reared up and brought its front legs down on one of the lower branches, as if it wanted to climb. The branch, big as a tree itself, practically exploded.", "The draccus reared again, coming down hard on the tree. I watched, certain that it was about to impale itself on the broken limb, but the jagged spear of hard wood barely dimpled its chest before splintering. The draccus crashed into the trunk, and though it didn\u2019t snap, it fractured with a sound like a crack of lightning.", "The draccus threw itself around, hopped and fell, rolling over jagged spurs of rock. It belched a huge gout of flame and charged the fractured oak tree again, striking with its great blunt wedge of a head. This time, it knocked the tree over, causing an explosion of earth and rock as the tree\u2019s roots tore out of the ground.", "All I could think of was the futility of trying to hurt this creature. It was bringing more force to bear against itself than I could ever hope to muster.", "\u201cThere\u2019s no way we can kill that,\u201d I said. \u201cIt would be like trying to attack a thunderstorm. How could we possibly hurt it?\u201d", "\u201cWe lure her over the side of a cliff,\u201d Denna said matter-of-factly.", "\u201cShe?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy do you think it\u2019s a she?\u201d", "\u201cWhy do you think it\u2019s a he?\u201d she replied, then shook her head as if to clear it. \u201cNever mind, it doesn\u2019t matter. We know it\u2019s drawn to fires. We just build one and hang it from a branch.\u201d She pointed to a few trees overhanging the cliff below. \u201cThen, when it rushes over to put it out....\u201d She made a pantomime with both hands of something falling.", "\u201cDo you think even that would hurt it?\u201d I asked dubiously.", "\u201cWell,\u201d Denna said, \u201cwhen you flick an ant off a table it doesn\u2019t get hurt even though for an ant that has to be like dropping off a cliff. But if one of us jumped off a roof, we\u2019d get hurt because we\u2019re heavier. It makes sense that bigger things fall even harder.\u201d She gave a pointed look down at the draccus. \u201cYou don\u2019t get much bigger than that.\u201d", "She was right, of course.

Is there something wrong with my idea?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not very heroic,\u201d I said dismissively. \u201cI was expecting something with a little more flair.\u201d", "\u201cWell I left my armor and warhorse at home,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re just upset because your big University brain couldn\u2019t think of a way, and my plan is brilliant.\u201d She pointed behind us, to the box canyon. \u201cWe\u2019ll build the fire in one of those metal pans. They\u2019re wide and shallow and they\u2019ll take the heat. Was there any rope in that shed?\u201d", "\u201cI ...\u201d I felt the familiar sinking feeling in my gut. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d", "Denna patted me on the arm. \u201cDon\u2019t look like that.

I feel a little like running around and jumping on things too.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s the mania I was talking about,\u201d I said.", "After a quarter-hour the draccus left the valley.

I handed it over. \u201cYou find some rope. I\u2019m going to go get you a present.\u201d She skipped away lightly, her dark hair flying behind her.", "I made a quick search of the house, holding my breath as much as possible. I found a hatchet, broken crockery, a barrel of wormy flour, a mildewy straw tick, a ball of twine, but no rope.", "Denna gave a delighted shout from the trees, ran up to me, and pressed a black scale into my hand. It was warm with the sun, slightly larger than hers but more oval than tear-shaped.", "\u201cThank you kindly, m\u2019lady.\u201d", "She bobbed a charming curtsey, grinning. \u201cRope?\u201d", "I held up a ball of rough twine. \u201cThis is as close as I could find. Sorry.\u201d", "Denna frowned, then shrugged it off. \u201cOh well. Your turn for a plan. You have any strange and wonderful magics from the University? Any dark powers better left alone?\u201d", "I turned the scale over in my hands and thought about it. I had wax, and this scale would make as good a link as any hair. I could make a simulacrum of the draccus, but then what? A hotfoot wasn\u2019t going to bother a creature that was perfectly comfortable lying on a bed of coals.", "But there are more sinister things you can do with a mommet. Things no good arcanist was ever supposed to consider. Things with pins and knives that would leave a man bleeding even though he was miles away. True malfeasance.", "I looked at the scale in my hand, considering it. The thing was mostly iron and thicker than my palm in the middle. Even with a mommet and a hot fire for energy, I didn\u2019t know if I could make it through the scales to hurt the thing.", "Worst of all, if I tried I wouldn\u2019t know if it had worked. I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of sitting idly by some fire, sticking pins into a wax doll while miles away a drug-crazed draccus rolled in the flaming wreckage of some innocent family\u2019s farm.", "\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cNo magic I can think of.\u201d", "\u201cWe can go tell the constable that he needs to deputize about a dozen men with bows to come kill a drug-crazed big-as-a-house dragon-chicken.\u201d", "It came to me in a flash. \u201cPoison,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to poison it.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019ve got two quarts of arsenic on you?\u201d she asked skeptically. \u201cWould that even be enough for something big as that?\u201d", "\u201cNot arsenic.\u201d I nudged the oilskin sack with my foot.", "She looked down. \u201cOh,\u201d she said, crestfallen. \u201cWhat about my pony?\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019ll probably have to skip your pony,\u201d I said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll still have enough to buy you a half-harp.

She was highly distractible and prone to larking off in her own direction if she saw something interesting.", "We crossed the same small stream that we had before, and, despite the fact that it wasn\u2019t much more than ankle deep, Denna insisted on bathing. I washed up a little, then moved a discreet distance away and listened to her sing several rather racy songs. She also made several none-too-subtle invitations that I could join her in the water.", "Needless to say, I kept my distance. There are names for people who take advantage of women who are not in full control of themselves, and none of those names will ever rightfully be applied to me.", "", "Once we reached the peak of the greystone hill, I put Denna\u2019s surplus of energy to use and sent her to gather firewood while I made an even larger fire pit than our previous one. The bigger the fire, the quicker it would draw the draccus close.", "I sat down next to the oilskin bag and opened it.

I started with a bead the size of the last digit of my little finger, my guess as to how much resin Denna had actually swallowed. However, Denna had been liberally dosed with charcoal, which effectively reduced that by a half. I was left with a ball of black resin slightly larger than a pea.", "But that was just the amount required to make a human girl euphoric and energetic. I wanted to kill the draccus.

After gathering a small mountain of firewood, her mania was fading, leaving her in a content, almost dreamy lethargy. Still, I knew the aftereffects of the drug would leave her exhausted and weak. I wanted her safely in bed in Trebon for her recovery.", "After we finished eating I made my way over to where she sat with her back against one of the greystones. I cuffed up my shirtsleeves. \u201cAlright, I need to check you over,\u201d I said pompously.", "She smiled lazily at me, her eyes half-closed. \u201cYou really do know how to sweet talk a girl, don\u2019t you?\u201d", "I felt for her pulse in the hollow of her slender throat. It was slow, but steady. She shied away a little from my touch. \u201cYou tickle.\u201d", "\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d I asked.", "\u201cTired,\u201d she said, her voice slightly slurred. \u201cGood and tired and a little cold....\u201d", "While this wasn\u2019t unexpected, it was still a little surprising considering the fact that we were only feet away from a blazing bonfire. I fetched the extra blanket from my bag and brought it back to her. She snuggled into it.", "I leaned close so that I could look into her eyes. Her pupils were still wide and sluggish, but no more than before.", "She reached up and lay her hand on my cheek. \u201cYou have the sweetest face,\u201d she said, looking at me dreamily \u201cIt\u2019s like the perfect kitchen.\u201d", "I fought not to smile. This was the delirium. She\u2019d fade in and out of it before the profound exhaustion dragged her down into unconsciousness. If you see someone spouting nonsense to themselves in an alleyway in Tarbean, odds are they\u2019re not actually crazy, just a sweet-eater deranged by too much denner. \u201cA kitchen?\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything matches and the sugar bowl is right where it should be.\u201d", "\u201cHow does it feel when you breathe?\u201d I asked.", "\u201cNormal,\u201d she said easily. \u201cTight but normal.\u201d", "My heart beat a little faster at that. \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d", "\u201cI have trouble breathing,\u201d she said. \u201cMy chest gets tight sometimes and it\u2019s like breathing through pudding.\u201d She laughed. \u201cDid I say pudding? I meant molasses. Like a sweet molasses pudding.\u201d", "I fought off the urge to point out angrily that I\u2019d asked her to tell me if she felt anything wrong with her breathing. \u201cIs it hard to breathe now?\u201d", "She shrugged indifferently.", "\u201cI need to listen to your breathing,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have any tools here, so if you could unbutton your shirt a little, I\u2019ll need to press my ear against your chest.\u201d", "Denna rolled her eyes and unbuttoned more of her shirt than was altogether necessary. \u201cNow that one is entirely new,\u201d she said archly, sounding for a moment like her normal self. \u201cI\u2019ve never had anyone try that before.\u201d", "I turned and pressed my ear up against her breastbone.", "\u201cWhat does my heart sound like?\u201d she asked.", "\u201cIt\u2019s slow but strong,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good heart.\u201d", "\u201cIs it saying anything?\u201d", "\u201cNothing I can hear,\u201d I said.", "\u201cListen harder.\u201d", "\u201cTake a few deep breaths and don\u2019t talk,\u201d I said. \u201cI need to listen to your breathing.\u201d", "I listened. The air rushed in and I felt one of her breasts pressing against my arm. She exhaled and I felt her breath, warm against the back of my neck. Gooseflesh broke out over my whole body.", "I could picture Arwyl\u2019s disapproving stare. I closed my eyes and tried to concentrate on what I was doing. In and out, it was like listening to the wind through the trees. In and out, I could hear a faint crackling, like paper crumpling, like a faint sigh. But there was no wetness, no bubbling.", "\u201cYour hair smells really nice,\u201d she said.", "I sat up. \u201cYou\u2019re fine,\u201d I said. \u201cMake sure to let me know if it gets any worse or feels different.\u201d", "She nodded amiably, smiling dreamily.", "Irritated that the draccus seemed to be taking its sweet time making an appearance, I heaped more wood on the fire. I looked out at the northern bluffs, but there was nothing to see in the dim light but the outlines of trees and rocks.", "Denna laughed suddenly. \u201cDid I call your face a sugar bowl or something?\u201d she asked, peering at me. \u201cAm I even making any sense right now?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s just a little delirium,\u201d I reassured her. \u201cYou\u2019ll fade in and out of it before you go to sleep.\u201d", "\u201cI hope it\u2019s as much fun for you as it is for me,\u201d she said pulling the blanket closer around herself. \u201cIt\u2019s like a cottony dream, but not as warm.\u201d", "I climbed the ladder to the top of the greystone where we had stashed our possessions. I took a handful of the denner resin out of the oilskin sack, carried it down, and threw it on the edge of the fire. It burned sullenly, giving off an acrid smoke that the wind brushed away to the north and west, toward the unseen bluffs. Hopefully the draccus would smell it and come running.", "\u201cI had pneumonia when I was just a tiny baby,\u201d Denna said with no particular inflection. \u201cThat\u2019s why my lungs aren\u2019t good. It\u2019s horrible not being able to breathe sometimes.\u201d", "Denna\u2019s eyes were half closed as she continued, almost as if she were talking to herself. \u201cI stopped breathing for two minutes and died. Sometimes I wonder if this all isn\u2019t some sort of mistake, if I should be dead. But if it isn\u2019t a mistake I have to be here for a reason. But if there is a reason, I don\u2019t know what that reason is.\u201d", "There was the distinct possibility that she didn\u2019t even realize that she was talking, and an even greater possibility that most of the important parts of her brain were already asleep and she wouldn\u2019t remember any of what was happening now in the morning. Since I didn\u2019t know how to respond, I simply nodded.", "\u201cThat\u2019s the first thing you said to me. I was just wondering why you\u2019re here. My seven words. I\u2019ve been wondering the same thing for so long.\u201d", "The sun, already hidden by the clouds, finally set behind the western mountains. As the landscape faded into darkness, the top of this small hill felt like an island in a great ocean of night.", "Denna was beginning to nod where she sat, her head slowly sinking to her chest, then bobbing back up. I walked over and held out my hand. \u201cCome on, the draccus will be here soon. We should get up onto the stones.\u201d", "She nodded and came to her feet, blankets still wrapped around her. I followed her to the ladder and she made her slow, stumbling way up to the top of the greystone.", "It was chilly up on the stone, away from the fire. The wind brushed past, making the slight chill worse. I spread one blanket across the stone and she sat down, huddled in the other blanket. The cold seemed to rouse her a little and she looked around peevishly, shivering. \u201cDamn chicken. Come eat your dinner. I\u2019m cold.\u201d", "\u201cI was hoping to have you tucked into a warm bed in Trebon by now,\u201d I admitted. \u201cSo much for my brilliant plan.\u201d", "\u201cYou always know where you\u2019re doing,\u201d she said muzzily \u201cYou\u2019re important with your green eyes looking at me like I mean something. It\u2019s okay that you have better things to do. It\u2019s enough that I get you sometimes. Once in a while. I know I\u2019m lucky for that, to get you just a little.\u201d", "I nodded agreeably, as I watched the hillside for signs of the draccus. We sat for a while longer, staring off into the dark. Denna nodded a little, then pulled herself upright again and fought off another violent shiver. \u201cI know you don\u2019t think of me ...\u201d She trailed off.", "It\u2019s best to humor people in delirium, lest they turn violent. \u201cI think about you all the time, Denna,\u201d I said.", "\u201cDon\u2019t patronize me,\u201d she said crossly, then her tone softened again. \u201cYou don\u2019t think of me like that. That\u2019s fine. But if you\u2019re cold too, you could come over here and put your arms around me. Just a little.\u201d", "My heart in my mouth, I moved closer and sat behind her, wrapping my arms around her. \u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d she said, relaxing. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve always been cold.\u201d", "We sat looking to the north. She leaned against me, delightful in my arms. I drew shallow breaths, not wanting to disturb her.", "Denna stirred slightly, murmuring. \u201cYou\u2019re so gentle. You never push....\u201d She trailed off again, resting more heavily against my chest. Then she roused herself. \u201cYou could, you know, push more. Just a little.\u201d", "I sat there in the dark, holding her sleeping body in my arms. She was soft and warm, indescribably precious. I had never held a woman before. After a few moments my back began to ache with the pressure of supporting her weight and my own. My leg started to go numb. Her hair tickled my nose. Still, I didn\u2019t move for fear of ruining this, the most wonderful moment of my life.", "Denna shifted in her sleep, then started to slide sideways and jerked awake. \u201cLie down,\u201d she said, her voice clear again. She fumbled with the blanket, pulling it away so it was no longer between us. \u201cCome on. You\u2019ve got to be cold too. You\u2019re not a priest, so you\u2019re not going to get in trouble for it. We\u2019ll be fine. Just a little fine in the cold.\u201d", "I put my arms around her and she draped the blanket over both of us.", "We lay on our sides, like spoons nesting in a drawer. My arm ended up under her head, like a pillow. She curled snugly along the inside of my body, so easy and natural, as if she had been designed to fit there.", "As I lay there, I realized I had been wrong before, this was the most wonderful moment of my life.", "Denna stirred in her sleep. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d she said clearly.", "\u201cMean what?\u201d I asked softly. Her voice was different, no longer dreamy and tired. I wondered if she was talking in her sleep.", "\u201cBefore. You said you\u2019d knock me down and make me eat coals. You\u2019d never hit me.\u201d She turned her head a little. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t, would you? Not even if it was for my own good?\u201d", "I felt a chill go through me. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d", "There was a long pause, and I was beginning to think she\u2019d fallen asleep when she spoke up again. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you everything. I know Ash didn\u2019t die at the farm. When I was heading toward the fire he found me. He came back and said that everyone was dead. He said that people would be suspicious if I was the only one who survived....\u201d", "I felt a hard, dark anger rise up in me. I knew what came next, but I let her talk. I didn\u2019t want to hear it, but I knew she needed to tell someone.", "\u201cHe didn\u2019t just do it out of the blue,\u201d she said. \u201cHe made sure it was what I really wanted. I knew it wouldn\u2019t look convincing if I did it to myself. He made sure I really wanted him to. He made me ask him to hit me. Just to be sure.", "\u201cAnd he was right.\u201d She didn\u2019t move at all as she spoke. \u201cEven this way they thought I had something to do with it. If he hadn\u2019t done it, I might be in jail right now. They would\u2019ve hanged me.\u201d", "My stomach churned acid. \u201cDenna,\u201d I said. \u201cA man who could do that to you\u2014he\u2019s not worth your time. Not one moment of it. It\u2019s not a matter of him being only half a loaf. He\u2019s rotten through. You deserve better.\u201d", "\u201cWho knows what I deserve?\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s not my best loaf. He\u2019s it. Him or hungry.\u201d", "\u201cYou have other options,\u201d I said, then stalled, thinking of my conversation with Deoch. \u201cYou\u2019ve ... you\u2019ve got ...\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve got you,\u201d she said dreamily. I could hear the warm, sleepy smile in her voice, like a child tucked into bed. \u201cWill you be my dark-eyed Prince Gallant and protect me from pigs? Sing to me? Whisk me away to tall trees....\u201d she trailed off to nothing.", "\u201cI will,\u201d I said, but I could tell by the heavy weight of her against my arm that she had finally fallen asleep.", "", "", ""], "CHAPTER EIGHTY": ["CHAPTER EIGHTY", "Touching Iron", "\nI lay awake, feeling Denna\u2019s gentle breath against my arm. I couldn\u2019t have slept even if I\u2019d wanted to. The closeness of her filled me with a crackling energy, a low warmth, a gentle thrumming hum. I lay awake savoring it, every moment precious as a jewel.", "Then I heard the distant crack of a breaking branch. Then another. Earlier I wanted nothing more than the draccus to hurry to our fire. Now, I would have traded my right hand to have it go on its merry way for another five minutes.", "Still, it came. I began gently untangling myself from Denna. She barely stirred in her sleep. \u201cDenna?\u201d I shook her gently, then harder. Nothing. I wasn\u2019t surprised. There are few things deeper than a sweet-eater\u2019s sleep.", "I covered her in the blanket, then set my travelsack on one side, the oilskin bag on the other, like bookends. If she rolled in her sleep, she would butt into those before getting close to the edge of the greystone.", "I moved to the other side of the stone and looked out to the north. The clouds were still thick overhead, so I couldn\u2019t see anything outside the circle of firelight.", "Feeling carefully with my fingers, I located the piece of twine I had laid across the top of the greystone. The other end was tied to the rope handle of the wooden bucket below, midway between the fire and the greystones. My main fear was that the draccus might accidentally crush the bucket before it smelled it. I planned to haul the bucket to safety if that happened, then cast it out again. Denna had laughed at my plan, referring to it as chicken-fishing.", "The draccus came to the top of the hill, moving noisily through the brush. It stopped just inside the circle of firelight. Its dark eyes shone red, and there was red on its scales. It made a deep huffing sound and began to circle the fire, slowly rocking its head back and forth. It blew a wide plume of fire in what I was coming to recognize as either some sort of greeting or a challenge.", "It darted toward our fire. Despite the fact that I\u2019d watched it at some length, I was still surprised by how quickly the huge animal could move. It pulled up short of the fire, huffed again, then advanced on the bucket.", "Despite the fact that the bucket was sturdy wood and built to hold at least two gallons, it looked tiny as a teacup next to the draccus\u2019 massive head. It sniffed again, then butted the bucket with its nose, tipping it over.", "The bucket rolled in a half-circle, but I\u2019d packed the sticky resin in tightly The draccus took another step, huffed again, and took the whole thing into its mouth.", "I was so relieved that I almost forgot to let go of the twine. It was jerked out of my hands as the draccus chewed the bucket a little, crushing it in its massive jaws. Then it worked its head up and down, forcing the sticky mass down its gullet.", "I breathed a huge sigh of relief and sat down to watch as the draccus circled the fire. It gushed out a billow of blue flame, then another, then turned and rolled in the fire, wriggling and crushing it into the dirt.", "Once the fire was flattened, the draccus began to follow the same pattern as before. It sought out the scattered pieces of the fire, rolled in them until they were extinguished, then ate the wood. I could almost imagine each new stick and stump it swallowed forcing the denner resin deeper into its gizzard, mixing it around, breaking it up, forcing it to dissolve.", "A quarter-hour passed as I watched it complete its circuit of the fire. I\u2019d hoped it would have showed the effects of the resin by now. By my best guess, it had eaten six times a lethal dose. It should rush quickly past the initial stages of euphoria and mania. Then would follow delirium, paralysis, coma, and death. By all my calculations it should be over within an hour, hopefully sooner.", "I felt a pang of regret as I watched it go about the business of crushing out the scattered fires. It was a magnificent animal. I hated to kill it even more than I hated to waste upwards of sixty talents worth of ophalum. But there was no denying what would happen if events were left to run their course. I didn\u2019t want the deaths of innocents on my conscience.", "Soon it stopped eating. It merely rolled on the scattered branches, extinguishing them. It was moving more vigorously now, a sign that the denner was beginning to take effect. It started to grunt, low and deep. Grunt. Grunt. A wash of blue fire. Roll. Grunt. Roll.", "Finally there was nothing left but the bed of glimmering coals. As before, the draccus positioned itself on top of them and laid down, extinguishing all the light on the top of the hill.", "It lay there quietly for a moment. Then grunted again. Grunt. Grunt. Wash of fire. It wriggled its belly farther into the coals, almost like it was fidgeting. If this was the onset of mania, it was coming too slowly for my liking. I\u2019d hoped that it would be well on its way to delirium by now. Had I underestimated the dosage?", "As my eyes slowly adjusted to the dark, I realized there was another source of light. At first I thought the clouds had blown over, and the moon was peering in from the horizon. But when I turned away from the draccus to look behind me, I saw the truth.", "Off to the southwest, barely two miles away, Trebon was full of firelight. Not just dim candlelight from windows, there were tall flames leaping everywhere. For a moment I thought the city was ablaze.", "Then I realized what was happening: the harvest festival. There was a tall bonfire in the middle of town, and smaller ones outside the houses where people would be giving cider to the weary workers. They would drink and throw their shamble-men into the fires. Dummies made of wheat sheaves, of barley shocks, of straw, of chaff. Dummies built to flare up bright and sudden, a ritual to celebrate the end of the year, something that was supposed to keep demons away.", "Behind me I heard the draccus grunt. I looked down at it. Just as I had been, it was facing away from Trebon, toward the dark cliffs to the north.", "I am not a religious person, but I will admit that I prayed then. I prayed earnestly to Tehlu and all his angels, asking for the draccus to die, just slide quietly asleep and pass on without turning around to see the city\u2019s fires.", "I waited for several long minutes. At first I thought the draccus was asleep, but as my eyes sharpened I could see its head weaving steadily back and forth, back and forth. As my eyes grew more accustomed to the dark, the fires of Trebon seemed to grow brighter. It had been half an hour since it had eaten the resin. Why wasn\u2019t it dead yet?", "I wanted to throw down the rest of the resin, but I didn\u2019t dare. If the draccus turned toward me, it would be facing south, toward the town. Even if I threw the sack of resin directly in front of it, it might turn around to resettle itself on the fire. Perhaps if\u2014", "The draccus roared then, deep and powerful as before. I had no doubt they heard it in Trebon. I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised to learn that they had heard it in Imre. I glanced at Denna. She shifted in her sleep but didn\u2019t wake.", "The draccus bounded off the bed of coals, looking for all the world like a frisking puppy. The coals still glimmered in places, giving me enough light to see the great beast roll around, flip. Bite at the air. Turn ...", "\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cNo no no.\u201d", "It looked out toward Trebon. I could see the leaping flames of the town\u2019s fires reflected in its huge eyes. It breathed another gout of blue fire in a high arc. The same gesture it had made before: a greeting or a challenge.", "Then it was running, tearing down the hillside with demented abandon. I heard it crashing and snapping through the trees. Another roar.", "I thumbed on my sympathy lamp and went to Denna, shaking her roughly \u201cDenna. Denna! You have to get up!\u201d", "She barely stirred.", "I lifted her eyelid and checked her pupils. They showed none of their earlier sluggishness and shrank quickly in response to the light. That meant the denner resin had finally worked its way out of her system. This was simple exhaustion, nothing else. Just to be sure I lifted both lids and brought the light back around again.", "Yes. Her pupils were fine. She was fine. As if to confirm my opinion, Denna scowled fiercely and squirmed away from the light, muttering something indistinct and decidedly unladylike. I couldn\u2019t make out all of it, but the words \u201cwhoremonger\u201d and \u201csoddoff\u201d were used more than once.", "I scooped her up, blankets and all, and carefully made my way down to the ground. I bundled her up again between the arch of the greystones. She seemed to rouse herself slightly as I jostled her around. \u201cDenna?\u201d", "\u201cMoteth?\u201d she muttered around a mouthful of sleep, her eyes barely moving under her lids.", "\u201cDenna! The draccus is going down to Trebon! I have to ...\u201d", "I stopped. Partly because it was obvious she had dropped back into unconsciousness, but also because I wasn\u2019t entirely sure what it was I had to do.", "I had to do something. Normally the draccus would avoid a town, but drug-crazed and manic, I had no idea what its reaction to the harvest fires would be. If it rampaged through the town it would be my fault. I had to do something.", "I dashed to the top of the greystone, grabbed both bags, and came back down. I upended the travelsack, emptying everything onto the ground. I grabbed the crossbow bolts, wrapped them in my torn shirt, and stuffed them into my travelsack. I threw in the hard iron scale too, then stuffed the bottle of brand into the oilskin sack for padding and put that in my travelsack as well.", "My mouth was dry, so I took a quick swallow of water from the water-skin, recapped it, and left it for Denna. She would be terribly thirsty when she woke up.", "I slung the travelsack over my shoulder and cinched it tight across my back. Then I thumbed on my sympathy lamp, picked up the hatchet, and began to run.", "I had a dragon to kill.", "", "I ran madly through the woods, the light from my sympathy lamp bobbing wildly, revealing obstacles ahead of me bare moments before I was on top of them. Small wonder that I fell, tumbling down the hill, ass over teakettle. When I got up I easily found my lamp, but I abandoned the hatchet, knowing deep in my heart that it wouldn\u2019t be of any use against the draccus.", "I fell twice more before I made it to the road, then I tucked my head like a sprinter and ran toward the distant light of the city. I knew the draccus could move faster than me, but I hoped it would be slowed by the trees, or disoriented. If I made it to the town first I could warn them, get them ready....", "But as the road emerged from the trees, I could see the fires were brighter, wilder. Houses were burning. I could hear the draccus\u2019 near-constant bellowing punctuated by shouting and high-pitched screams.", "I slowed to a trot as I came into town, catching my breath. Then I scampered up the side of a house to one of the few two-story rooftops so I could see what was really happening.", "In the town square the bonfire had been scattered everywhere. Several nearby houses and shops were staved in like rotten barrels, most of them burning fitfully Fire flickered on the wooden shingles of a handful of roofs. If not for the evening\u2019s earlier rain, the town would already be ablaze instead of just a few scattered buildings. Still, it was just a matter of time.", "I couldn\u2019t see the draccus, but I could hear the great crunching it made as it rolled in the wreckage of a burning house. I saw a gush of blue flame rise high above the rooftops and heard it roar again. The sound made me sweat. Who knew what was going through its drug-addled mind right now?", "There were people everywhere. Some were simply standing, confused, others panicked and ran to the church, hoping to find shelter in the tall stone building or the huge iron wheel that hung there, promising them safety from demons. But the church doors were locked, and they were forced to find shelter elsewhere. Some people watched, horrified and weeping, from their windows, but a surprising number kept their heads and were forming a bucket line from the town\u2019s cistern atop the city hall to a nearby burning building.", "And just like that I knew what I had to do. It was like I had suddenly stepped onto a stage. Fear and hesitation left me. All that remained was for me to play my part.", "I jumped to a nearby roof, then made my way across several others until I came to a house near the town square where a scattered piece of bonfire had set the roof burning. I pried up a thick shingle burning along one edge and took off running for the roof of the town hall.", "I was only two roofs away when I slipped. Too late I realized I\u2019d jumped to the inn\u2019s roof\u2014no wood shingles here, but clay tiles slippery with rain. I held tight to the burning shingle as I fell, unwilling to let it go to brace my fall. I slid nearly to the edge of the roof before I came to a stop, heart pounding.", "Breathless, I kicked off my boots as I lay there. Then with the familiar feel of rooftop under my calloused feet I ran, jumped, ran, slid, and jumped again. Finally I swung myself one-handed by an eave-pipe onto the flat stone roof of the town hall.", "Still clutching the burning shingle, I made my way up the ladder to the top of the cistern, whispering a breathless thanks to whoever had left it open to the sky.", "As I\u2019d sprinted across the rooftops, the flame on the shingle had gone out, leaving a thin line of red ember along the edge. I puffed it carefully back to life and soon it was blazing merrily again. I broke it down the middle and dropped half to the flat roof below.", "Turning to survey the town. I made note of the biggest fires. There were six especially bad ones, blazing up into the dark sky. Elxa Dal had always said that all fires are one fire, and all fires are the sympathist\u2019s to command. Very well then, all fires were one fire. This fire. This piece of burning shingle. I murmured a binding and focused my Alar. I used my thumbnail to scratch a hasty ule rune onto the wood, then doch, then pesin. In the brief moment it took to do that the entire shingle was smoldering and smoking, hot in my hand.", "I hooked my foot around the ladder rung and leaned deep into the cistern, quenching the shingle in the water. For a brief moment I felt the cool water surround my hand, then it quickly warmed. Even though the shingle was under water, I could see the faint line of red ember still smoldering along its edge.", "I pulled out my pocketknife with my other hand and drove it through the shingle into the wooden wall of the cistern, pinning my makeshift piece of sygaldry under the water. I have no doubt it was the quickest, most slapdash heat-eater ever created.", "Pulling myself back onto the ladder, I looked around to a town blessedly dark. The flames had dimmed, and in most places had subsided to sullen coals. I hadn\u2019t doused the fires, merely slowed them down enough to give the townsfolk and their buckets a fighting chance.", "But my job was only half done. I dropped to the roof and picked up the other half of the still-burning shingle I\u2019d dropped. Then I slid down a drainpipe and legged it away through the dark streets, across the town square to the front of the Tehlin church.", "I stopped under the huge oak that stood before the front door, still holding its full array of autumn leaves. Kneeling, I opened my travelsack and brought out the oilskin bag with all the remaining resin. I poured the bottle of brand onto it and set it afire with the burning shingle. It flared up quickly, billowing acrid, sweet-smelling smoke.", "Then I put the blunt end of the shingle between my teeth, jumped to catch a low branch, and began to climb the tree. It was easier than making my way up the side of a building, and took me high enough to where I could jump to the wide stone window ledge on the church\u2019s second floor. I broke off a twig from the oak tree and stuffed it into my pocket.", "I edged along the window ledge to where the huge iron wheel hung, bolted to the stone of the wall. Climbing that was quicker than a ladder, though the iron spokes were startlingly cold against my still-wet hands.", "I made my way to the top of the wheel, and from there pulled myself onto the flat peak of the highest roof in town. The fires were still dark for the most part, and most of the shouting had died down to sobs and a low murmur of urgent, hurried talk. I took the piece of shingle out of my mouth and blew on it until it was flaming again. Then I concentrated, muttered another binding, and held the oak twig above the flame. I looked out over the town and saw the glimmering coals dim even further.", "A moment passed.", "The oak tree below burst into sudden, brilliant flame. It flared brighter than a thousand torches as all its leaves caught fire at the same time.", "In the sudden light I saw the draccus raise its head two streets away. It bellowed and blew a cloud of blue flame even as it started to run toward the fire. It turned a corner too quickly and caromed wildly into the wall of a shop, smashing through with little resistance.", "It slowed as it approached the tree, blowing flame again and again. The leaves flared and faded quickly, leaving nothing but a thousand embers, making the tree look like an immense extinguished candelabrum.", "In the dim red light, the draccus was hardly more than a shadow. But I could still see the beast\u2019s attention wander, now that the bright flames were gone. The massive wedge of a head swayed back and forth, back and forth. I cursed under my breath. It wasn\u2019t close enough....", "Then the draccus huffed loud enough for me to hear from where I stood a hundred feet above. The head snapped around as it smelled the sweet smoke of the burning resin. It snuffed, grunted, and took another step toward the smoking bag of resin. It didn\u2019t show nearly the restraint it had earlier, and practically pounced on it, snapping up the smoldering sack in its great wide mouth.", "I took a deep breath and shook my head, trying to clear away some of the sluggishness I felt. I had performed two rather substantial pieces of sympathy in quick succession and was feeling rather thickheaded because of it.", "But as they say, third time pays for all. I broke my mind into two pieces, then, with some difficulty, into a third. Nothing less than a triple binding would do for this.", "As the draccus worked its jaw, trying to swallow the sticky mass of resin, I fumbled in my travelsack for the heavy black scale, then brought the loden-stone out from my cloak. I spoke my bindings clearly and focused my Alar. I brought the scale and stone up in front of me until I could feel them tugging at each other.", "I concentrated, focused.", "I let go of the loden-stone. It shot toward the iron scale. Below my feet was an explosion of stone as the great iron wheel tore free from the church wall.", "A ton of wrought iron fell. If anyone had been watching, they would have noticed that the wheel fell faster than gravity could account for. They would have noticed that it fell at an angle, almost as if it were drawn to the draccus. Almost as if Tehlu himself steered it toward the beast with a vengeful hand.", "But there was no one there to see the truth of things. And there was no God guiding it. Only me.", "", "", ""], "CHAPTER EIGHTY-ONE": ["CHAPTER EIGHTY-ONE", "Pride", "\nLooking down i saw the draccus pinned beneath the great wrought-iron wheel. It lay motionless and dark in front of the church, and despite the necessity of it all, I felt a pang of regret for killing the poor beast.", "I had one long moment of exhausted pure relief. The autumn air was fresh and sweet despite the woodsmoke, and the stone roof of the church was cool under my feet. Feeling rather smug, I tucked the scale and loden-stone back into my travelsack. I drew a deep breath and looked out over the town I had saved.", "Then I heard a grating noise and felt the roof shift beneath me. The front of the building sagged, crumbled, and I staggered as the world fell out from underneath me. I looked for a safe roof to leap to, but there were none close enough. I scrambled backward as the roof disintegrated into a mass of falling rubble.", "Desperate, I leapt for the charred branches of the oak tree. I grabbed one, but it snapped under my weight. I tumbled through the branches, struck my head, and fell into darkness.", "", "", ""], "CHAPTER EIGHTY-TWO": ["CHAPTER EIGHTY-TWO", "Ash and Elm...", "\nI woke in a bed. In a room. In an inn. More than that was not immediately clear to me. It felt exactly like someone had hit me in the head with a church.", "I had been cleaned and bandaged. Very thoroughly bandaged. Someone had seen fit to treat all my recent injuries no manner how minor. I had white linen around my head, my chest, my knee, and one of my feet. Someone had even cleaned and wrapped the mild abrasions on my hands and the knife wound from three days ago when Ambrose\u2019s thugs had tried to kill me.", "The lump on my head seemed to be the worst of the lot. It throbbed and left me dizzy when I lifted my head. Moving was a lesson in punitive anatomy. I swung my feet off the edge of the bed and grimaced: deep tissue trauma to the medial-poloni in the right leg. I sat up: oblique strain to the cartilage between the lower ribs. I got to my feet: minor spraining of the sub ... trans ... damn, what was that called? I pictured Arwyl\u2019s face, frowning behind his round spectacles.", "My clothes had been washed and mended. I put them on, moving slowly to savor all the exciting messages my body was sending me. I was glad there wasn\u2019t a mirror in the room, knowing I must look completely battered. The bandage around my head was rather irritating, but I decided to leave it on. From the way things felt, it might be the only thing keeping my head from falling into several different pieces.", "I went to the window. It was overcast, and in the grey light the town looked awful, soot and ash everywhere. The shop across the street had been smashed like a dollhouse under a soldier\u2019s boot. People moved about slowly, sifting through the wreckage. The clouds were thick enough that I couldn\u2019t tell what time it was.", "I heard a faint rush of air as the door opened, and I turned to see a young woman standing in the doorway. Young, pretty, unassuming, the sort of girl that always worked at little inns like this: a Nellie. Nell. The sort of girl who spent her life in a perpetual flinch because the innkeeper had a temper and a sharp tongue and wasn\u2019t afraid to show her the back of his hand. She gaped at me, obviously surprised that I was out of bed.", "\u201cWas anyone killed?\u201d I asked.", "She shook her head. \u201cThe Liram boy got his arm broke pretty bad. And some folk got burned and such ...\u201d I felt my whole body relax. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be up, sir. Doctor said you weren\u2019t likely to wake up at all. You should rest.\u201d", "\u201cIs ... has my cousin come back to town?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe girl who was out at the Mauthen farm. Is she here too?\u201d", "The young woman shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s just you, sir.\u201d", "\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d", "\u201cSupper\u2019s not quite ready, sir. But I can bring you something if you like.\u201d", "My travelsack had been left by the side of the bed. I lifted it up onto my shoulder, it felt odd with nothing inside except the scale and loden-stone. I looked around for my boots until I remembered I\u2019d kicked them off to get better traction running around the rooftops last night.", "I left the room with the girl trailing behind me and headed down to the common room. It was the same fellow behind the bar as before, still wearing his scowl.", "I walked up to him. \u201cMy cousin,\u201d I said. \u201cIs she in town?\u201d", "The barman turned the scowl toward the doorway behind me as the young girl emerged. \u201cNell, what in God\u2019s hell are you doing letting him up? I swear you haven\u2019t got the sense God gave a dog.\u201d", "So her name really was Nell. I would have found that amusing under different circumstances.", "He turned to me and gave a smile that was really just a different sort of scowl. \u201cLord boy, does your face hurt? It\u2019s killing me.\u201d He chortled at his own joke.", "I glared at him. \u201cI asked about my cousin.\u201d", "He shook his head. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t come back. Good riddance to bad luck, I say.\u201d", "\u201cBring me bread, fruit, and whatever meat you have ready in the back,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd a bottle of Avennish fruit wine. Strawberry if you have it.\u201d", "He leaned up against the bar and raised an eyebrow at me. His scowl reshaped itself into a small, patronizing smile. \u201cNo sense rushing about, son. The constable will be wanting to talk to you now that you\u2019re up.\u201d", "I clenched my teeth against my first choice of words and took a deep breath. \u201cListen, I\u2019ve had an exceptionally irritating couple of days, my head hurts in ways you don\u2019t have the full wit to understand, and I have a friend who might be in trouble.\u201d I stared at him, icy in my calm. \u201cI have no desire to have things turn unpleasant. So I am asking you, kindly, to get me what I asked for.\u201d I brought out my purse. \u201cPlease.\u201d", "He looked at me, anger slowly bubbling up onto his face. \u201cYou mouthy little swaggercock. If you don\u2019t show me a little respect, I\u2019ll sit you down and tie you to a chair until the constable comes.\u201d", "I tossed an iron drab onto the bar, keeping another clenched tight in my fist.", "He scowled at it. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d", "I concentrated and felt a chill begin to bleed up my arm. \u201cThat is your tip,\u201d I said as a thin curl of smoke began to curl up from the drab. \u201cFor your quick and courteous service.\u201d", "The varnish around the drab began to bubble and char in a black ring around the piece of iron. The man stared at it, mute and horrified.", "\u201cNow fetch me what I asked for,\u201d I said, looking him in the eye. \u201cAnd a skin of water too. Or I will burn this place down around your ears and dance among the ashes and your charred, sticky bones.\u201d", "", "I came to the top of the greystone hill with my travelsack full. I was barefoot, out of breath, and my head was throbbing. Denna was nowhere to be seen.", "Making a quick search of the area, I found all my scattered possessions where I\u2019d left them. Both blankets. The waterskin was mostly empty but other than that, everything was here. Denna might have just stepped away for a call of nature.", "I waited. I waited for longer than was entirely sensible. Then I called for her, softly at first, then louder, though my head throbbed when I shouted. Finally I just sat. All I could think about was Denna waking alone, aching, thirsty, and disoriented. What must she have thought?", "I ate a little then, trying to think of what I could do next. I considered opening the bottle of wine, but knew it was a bad idea, as I undoubtedly had a mild concussion. I fought off the irrational worry that Denna might have wandered into the woods in a delirium, and that I should go look for her. I considered lighting a fire, so she would see it and come back....", "But no. I knew she was simply gone. She woke, saw that I wasn\u2019t there, and left. She had said it herself when we left the inn in Trebon. I leave where I\u2019m not wanted. The rest I can make up as I go. Did she think I had abandoned her?", "Regardless, I knew in my bones that she was long gone from here. I packed up my travelsack. Then, just in case I was wrong, I wrote a note explaining what had happened and that I would wait for her in Trebon for a day. I used a piece of coal to write her name on one of the greystones, then drew an arrow down to where I left all the food I had brought, a bottle of water, and one of the blankets.", "Then I left. My mood was not a pleasant one. My thoughts were not gentle or kind.", "", "When I came back to Trebon, dusk was closing over the city. I made my way onto the rooftops with a little more care than usual. I wouldn\u2019t be able to trust my balance until my head had a few days to mend itself.", "Still it was no great feat to make it to the roof of the inn where I collected my boots. From this vantage, in the dim light, the town looked grim. The front half of the church had completely collapsed and nearly a third of the town had been scarred by fire. Some buildings were merely singed, but others were little more than ash and cinders. Despite my best efforts, the fire must have raged out of control after I was knocked unconscious.", "I looked to the north and saw the peak of the greystone hill. I hoped to see the flicker of a fire, but there was nothing, of course.", "I made my way over to the flat roof of the town hall and climbed the ladder to the cistern. It was almost empty. A few feet of water rippled near the bottom, far below where my knife pinned a charred shingle to the wall. That explained the state the town was in. When the water level had dropped below my makeshift sygaldry, the fire had flared up again. Still, it had slowed things down. If not for that, there might not be any town left at all.", "Back at the inn a great many somber, sooty people were gathering to drink and gossip. My scowling friend was nowhere to be seen, but a cluster of folk were gathered around the bar, excitedly discussing something they saw there.", "The mayor and constable were there too. As soon as they spotted me, they rushed me into a private room to talk.", "I was tight-lipped and grim, and, after the events of the last several days, not terribly intimidated by the authority of two paunchy old men. They could tell, and that made them nervous. I had a headache and didn\u2019t feel like explaining myself, and was quite comfortable tolerating an uncomfortable silence. Because of this, they talked quite a bit, and in asking their own questions, they told me most of what I wanted to know.", "The town\u2019s injuries were blessedly minor. Because it had been the harvest festival, no one had been caught sleeping. There were a lot of bruises, singed hair, and folk that had breathed more smoke than was good for them, but aside from a few bad burns and the fellow whose arm had been crushed by a falling timber, I looked to have gotten the worst of it.", "They knew beyond all certainty that the draccus was a demon. A huge black demon breathing fire and poison. If there had been any slim sliver of doubt as to that fact, it had been laid to rest when the beast had been struck down by Tehlu\u2019s own iron.", "It was also agreed upon that the demon beast had been responsible for the destruction of the Mauthen farm. A reasonable conclusion despite the fact that it was dead wrong. Trying to convince them of anything else would be a pointless waste of my time.", "I had been found unconscious atop the iron wheel that had killed the demon. The local sawbone doctor had patched me up as best he could, and, unfamiliar with the remarkable thickness of my skull, expressed serious doubts as to whether or not I would ever wake.", "At first the general opinion was that I was merely an unlucky bystander, or that I had somehow pried the wheel off the church. However, my miraculous recovery combined with the fact that I had charred a hole into the bar downstairs encouraged people to finally take notice of what a young boy and an old widow had been saying all day: that when the old oak had gone up like a torch, they had seen someone standing on the roof of the church. He was lit by the fire below. His arms were raised in front of him, almost as if he were praying....", "Eventually the mayor and constable ran out of things to say to fill the silence, and merely sat there looking anxiously back and forth from me to each other.", "It occurred to me they didn\u2019t see a penniless, ragged boy sitting across from them. They saw a mysterious battered figure who had killed a demon. I saw no reason to dissuade them. In fact it was high time I caught a piece of luck in this business. If they considered me some sort of hero or holy man, it gave me useful leverage.", "\u201cWhat did you do with the demon\u2019s body?\u201d I asked and watched them relax. Until this point I had barely spoken a dozen words, responding to most of their tentative questions with grim silence.", "\u201cNo worry about that, sir,\u201d the constable said. \u201cWe knew what to do with it.\u201d", "My stomach knotted, and I knew before they told me: they\u2019d burned and buried it. The creature was a scientific marvel, and they had burned and buried it like trash. I knew naturalist scrivs in the Archives who would have cut off their hands to study such a rare creature. I had even hoped, deep in my heart, that bringing such an opportunity to their attention might win me my way back into the Archives.", "And the scales and bones. Hundreds of pounds of denatured iron that alchemists would have fought over....", "The mayor nodded eagerly and singsonged, \u201cDig a pit that\u2019s ten by two. Ash and elm and rowan too.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cThough it had to be a bigger hole than that, of course. Everyone took a turn to get it done as quickly as possible.\u201d He held up his hand, proudly displaying a set of fresh blisters.", "I closed my eyes and fought down the urge to throw things around the room and curse them in eight languages. That explained why the town was still in such a sorry state. Everyone had been busy burning and burying a creature worth a king\u2019s ransom.", "Still, there was nothing to be done about it. I doubted my new reputation would be enough to protect me if they caught me trying to dig it up. \u201cThe girl that survived the Mauthen wedding,\u201d I said. \u201cHas anyone seen her today?\u201d", "The mayor looked at the constable questioningly \u201cNot that I\u2019ve heard. Do you think she was connected to the beast in some way?\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d the question was so absurd I didn\u2019t understand it at first. \u201cNo! Don\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d I scowled at them. The last thing I needed was to somehow implicate Denna in all this. \u201cShe was helping me in my work.\u201d I said, careful to keep things ambiguous.", "The mayor glared at the constable, then looked back to me. \u201cIs your ... work finished here?\u201d He asked carefully, as if afraid of giving offense. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t mean to pry into your affairs ... but ...\u201d He licked his lips nervously. \u201cWhy did this happen? Are we safe?\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re as safe as I can make you,\u201d I said ambiguously It sounded like a heroic thing to say. If all I was going to gain from this was a bit of reputation, I might as well make sure it was the right sort.", "Then I had an idea. \u201cTo be certain of your safety, I need one thing.\u201d I leaned forward in my chair, lacing my fingers together. \u201cI need to know what Mauthen dug up on Barrow Hill.\u201d", "I saw them look at each other, thinking: How does he know about that?", "I leaned back in the chair, fighting the urge to smile like a tomcat in a dovecote. \u201cIf I know what Mauthen found up there, I can take steps to make sure that this sort of thing doesn\u2019t happen again. I know it was a secret, but someone in town is bound to know more. Spread the word, and have anyone who knows anything come talk to me.\u201d", "I came to my feet smoothly. It took a conscious effort not to wince at the various twinges and aches. \u201cBut have them come quickly. I leave tomorrow evening. I have pressing business to the south.\u201d", "Then I swept out the door, my cloak trailing rather dramatically behind me. I am a trouper to my bones, and when the scene is set, I know how to make an exit.", "", "I spent the next day eating good food and dozing in my soft bed. I took a bath, tended to my various wounds, and generally took a well-deserved rest. A few people stopped by to tell me what I already knew. Mauthen had dug up barrow stones and found something buried there. What was it? Just something. No one knew more than that.", "I was sitting beside my bed toying with the idea of writing a song about the draccus when I heard a timid tapping at my door, so faint I almost missed it. \u201cCome in.\u201d", "The door opened a crack, then wider. A young girl of thirteen or so looked around nervously and scurried inside, closing the door softly behind her. She had curling, mousy brown hair and a pale face with two spots of color high on each cheek. Her eyes were hollow and dark, as if she had been crying, or missing sleep, or both.", "\u201cYou wanted to know what Mauthen dug up?\u201d She looked at me, then away.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I asked gently.", "\u201cVerainia Greyflock,\u201d she said dutifully. Then dropped a hurried curtsey, looking at the floor.", "\u201cThat\u2019s a lovely name,\u201d I said. \u201cA verian is a tiny red flower.\u201d I smiled, trying to set her at her ease. \u201cHave you ever seen one?\u201d She shook her head, eyes still on the floor. \u201cI\u2019m guessing no one calls you Verainia though. Are you a Nina?\u201d", "She looked up at that. A faint smile showed itself on her stricken face. \u201cThat\u2019s what my gran calls me.\u201d", "\u201cCome sit, Nina.\u201d I nodded to the bed, as it was the only other place to sit in the room.", "She sat, her hands twisting nervously in her lap. \u201cI seen it. The thing they got out of the barrow.\u201d She looked up at me, then down at her hands again. \u201cJimmy, Mauthen\u2019s youngest boy, he showed me.\u201d", "My heart beat faster. \u201cWhat was it?\u201d", "\u201cIt was a big fancy pot,\u201d she said softly \u201cAbout this high.\u201d She held her hand about three feet off the ground. It was shaking. \u201cIt had all sorts of writings and pictures on it. Really fancy. I haven\u2019t ever seen colors like that. And some of the paints were shiny like silver and gold.\u201d", "\u201cPictures of what?\u201d I asked, fighting to keep my voice calm.", "\u201cPeople,\u201d she said. \u201cMostly people. There was a woman holding a broken sword, and a man next to a dead tree, and another man with a dog biting his leg....\u201d she trailed off.", "\u201cWas there one with white hair and black eyes?\u201d", "She looked at me wide-eyed, nodded. \u201cGave me the all-overs.\u201d She shivered.", "The Chandrian. It was a vase showing the Chandrian and their signs.", "\u201cCan you remember anything else about the pictures?\u201d I asked. \u201cTake your time, think hard.\u201d", "She thought about it. \u201cThere was one with no face, just a hood with nothing inside. There was a mirror by his feet and there was a bunch of moons over him. You know, full moon, half moon, sliver moon.\u201d She looked down, thinking. \u201cAnd there was a woman....\u201d She blushed. \u201cWith some of her clothes off.\u201d", "\u201cCan you remember anything else?\u201d I asked. She shook her head. \u201cWhat about the writing?\u201d", "Nina shook her head. \u201cThis was all foreign writing. It didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d", "\u201cDo you think you could draw any of the writing you saw on it?\u201d", "She shook her head again. \u201cI only saw it for half a moment,\u201d she said. \u201cMe and Jimmy knew we\u2019d catch a beating if his da caught us.\u201d Her eyes welled up with sudden tears. \u201cAre demons going to be coming for me too, cause I seen it?\u201d", "I shook my head reassuringly, but she burst into tears anyway. \u201cI been so scared since what happened out at Mauthen\u2019s,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cI keep having dreams. I know they\u2019re going to come get me.\u201d", "I moved to sit next to her on the bed and put my arm around her, making comforting noises. Her sobbing slowly wound down. \u201cNothing is going to come and get you.\u201d", "She looked up at me. She was no longer crying, but I could see the truth of things in her eyes. Underneath it all she was still terrified. No amount of gentle words would be enough to reassure her.", "I stood and went over to my cloak. \u201cLet me give you something,\u201d I said, reaching into one of the pockets. I brought a piece of the sympathy lamp I was working on in the Fishery, it was a disk of bright metal covered with intricate sygaldry on one side.", "I brought it back to her. \u201cI got this charm when I was in Veloran. Far away, across the Stormwal mountains. It is a most excellent charm against demons.\u201d I took her hand and pressed it into her palm.", "Nina looked down at it, then up at me. \u201cDon\u2019t you need it?\u201d", "I shook my head. \u201cI have other ways of keeping safe.\u201d", "She clutched it, tears spilling down her cheeks again. \u201cOh thank you. I\u2019ll keep it with me all the time.\u201d Her hands were white-knuckled around it.", "She would lose it. Not soon, but in a year, or two, or ten. It was human nature, and when that happened, she would be even worse off than before. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for that,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cHere\u2019s how it works.\u201d I took her hand that clutched the piece of metal and wrapped it in my own. \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d", "Nina closed her eyes, and I slowly recited the first ten lines of Ve Valora Sartane. Not very appropriate really, but it was all I could think of at the time. Tema is an impressive sounding language, especially if you have a good dramatic baritone, which I did.", "I finished and she opened her eyes. They were full of wonder, not tears.", "\u201cNow it\u2019s tuned to you,\u201d I said. \u201cNo matter what, no matter where it is, it will protect you and keep you safe. You could even break it and melt it down and the charm would still hold.\u201d", "She threw her arms around me and kissed my cheek. Then stood suddenly, blushing. No longer pale and stricken, her eyes were bright. I hadn\u2019t noticed before, but she was beautiful.", "She left soon after that and I sat for a while on my bed, thinking.", "Over the last month I had pulled a woman from a blazing inferno.

Did she remember anything we had talked about that night as we lay on the greystone together?", "We docked in Imre a few hours after dawn, and I went straightaway to Devi\u2019s. After some spirited bargaining, I gave her the loden-stone and a single talent in order to wipe out my extremely short term loan of twenty talents. I still owed my original debt, but after all I\u2019d been through, a four-talent debt no longer seemed terribly ominous, despite the fact that my purse was largely empty again.", "It took a while to put my life back together. I\u2019d only been gone four days, but I needed to make apologies and give explanations to all manner of people. I\u2019d missed an appointment with Count Threpe, and two meetings with Manet, and a lunch with Fela. Anker\u2019s had gone without a musician for two nights. Even Auri reproached me gently for not coming to visit her.", "I\u2019d missed classes with Kilvin, Elxa Dal, and Arwyl. They all accepted my apologies with gracious disapproval. I knew that when next term\u2019s tuitions were set, I would end up paying for my sudden, largely unexplained absence.", "Most important were Wil and Sim. They had heard rumors of a student attacked in an alley. Given Ambrose\u2019s smugger-than-usual expression of late, they expected I had been run out of town, or, at worst, that I was weighted down with rocks at the bottom of the Omethi.", "They were the only ones that got a real explanation of what had happened. Though I didn\u2019t tell them the entire truth about why I was interested in the Chandrian, I did tell them the whole story, and showed them the scale. They were appropriately amazed, though they did tell me in plain terms that next time I would leave a note for them or there would be hell to pay.", "And I looked for Denna, hoping to make my most important explanation of all.

I was walking hurriedly along, my mind full of other things, when I turned a corner and had to pull up short to keep from running headlong into her.", "We both stood there for a half-second, startled and speechless. Despite the fact that I\u2019d been searching out her face in every shadow and carriage window for days, the sight of her stunned me. I\u2019d remembered the shape of her eyes, but not the weight of them. Their darkness, but not their depth. Her closeness pressed the breath out of my chest, as if I\u2019d suddenly been thrust deep underwater.", "I\u2019d spent long hours thinking about how this meeting might go. I had played the scene a thousand times in my mind. I feared she would be distant, aloof. That she would spurn me for leaving her alone in the woods. That she would be silent and sullenly hurt. I worried that she might cry, or curse me, or simply turn and leave.", "Denna gave me a delighted smile. \u201cKvothe!\u201d She caught up my hand and pressed it between her own. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you. Where have you been?\u201d", "I felt myself go weak with relief. \u201cOh, you know. Here and there.\u201d I made a nonchalant gesture. \u201cAround.\u201d", "\u201cYou left me dry in the dock the other day,\u201d she said with a mock-serious glare. \u201cI waited, but the tide never came.\u201d", "I was about to explain things to her when Denna gestured to a man standing beside her. \u201cForgive my rudeness. Kvothe, this is Lentaren.\u201d I hadn\u2019t even noticed him. \u201cLentaren, Kvothe.\u201d", "Lentaren was tall and lean. Well muscled, well dressed, and well-bred. He had a jawline a mason would have been proud of and straight, white teeth. He looked like Prince Gallant out of a storybook. He reeked of money.", "He smiled at me, his manner easy, friendly. \u201cNice to meet you, Kvothe,\u201d he said with a graceful half-bow.", "I returned the bow on pure reflex, smiling my most charming smile. \u201cAt your service, Lentaren.\u201d", "I turned back to Denna. \u201cWe should have lunch one of these days,\u201d I said blithely, arching one eyebrow ever so slightly, asking, is this Master Ash? \u201cI have some interesting stories for you.\u201d", "\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she shook her head slightly, telling me, No. \u201cYou left before you could finish your last one. I was terribly disappointed that I missed the end. Distraught, in fact.\u201d", "\u201cOh it\u2019s just the same thing you\u2019ve heard before a hundred times before,\u201d I said. \u201cPrince Gallant kills the dragon but loses the treasure and the girl.\u201d", "\u201cAh, a tragedy,\u201d Denna looked down. \u201cNot the ending I\u2019d hoped for, but no more than I expected, I suppose.\u201d", "\u201cIt would be something of a tragedy if it stopped there,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut it depends on how you look at it, really.

She took hold of his arm absentmindedly \u201cI don\u2019t generally go in for serial stories,\u201d she said, her expression momentarily serious and unreadable. Then she shrugged and gave me a hint of a wry smile. \u201cBut I\u2019ve certainly changed my mind about these things before.

They had already claimed a bench with a good view of the fountain in front of the Eolian. Water flared up around statuary nymphs being chased by a satyr.", "I laid my lute case down beside the bench and absentmindedly flipped open the lid, thinking my lute might enjoy the feel of a little sun on its strings. If you aren\u2019t a musician, I don\u2019t expect you to understand.", "Wil handed me an apple as I took a seat next to them. The wind brushed though the square and I watched the spray from the fountain move like gauzy curtains in the wind. A few red maple leaves danced circles on the cobblestones. I watched them as they skipped and twirled, tracing strange, complicated patterns in the empty air.", "\u201cI\u2019m guessing you finally found Denna?\u201dWilem asked after a while.", "I nodded without looking away from the leaves.

Why would she hunt for him if she knew he was safe?\u201d", "I hadn\u2019t considered that. Before I could think of a response, Simmon shook his head. \u201cShe was just making an excuse to spend time with him,\u201d he said as if it were plain as day.", "Wilem frowned a little.", "Sim looked back and forth between us, plainly surprised he had to explain himself. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious she has a thing for you,\u201d he said, and began counting on his fingers. \u201cShe finds you at Anker\u2019s. She comes to get you that night at Eolian when we\u2019re drinking. She makes up an excuse to wander around the middle of nowhere with you for a couple of days....\u201d", "\u201cSim,\u201d I said, exasperated. \u201cIf she was interested I\u2019d be able to find her more than once in a month of searching.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s a logical fallacy,\u201d Sim pointed out eagerly. \u201cFalse cause. All that proves is that you\u2019re lousy at finding her, or that she\u2019s hard to find. Not that she\u2019s not interested.\u201d", "\u201cIn fact,\u201d Wilem pointed out, taking up Simmon\u2019s side, \u201csince she finds you more often, it seems likely that she must spend a fair amount of time looking for you. You are not easy to track down. That indicates interest.\u201d", "I thought about the note she had left me, and for a moment I entertained the thought that Sim might be right. I felt a faint hope flicker in my chest, remembering that night we lay atop the greystone.", "Then I remembered that Derma had been delirious out of her mind that night. And I remembered Denna on Lentaren\u2019s arm. I thought of tall, handsome, wealthy Lentaren and all the other countless men who had something worthwhile to offer her. Something more than a good singing voice and manly bravado.", "\u201cYou know I\u2019m right!\u201d Simmon pushed his hair out of his eyes, laughing boyishly. \u201cYou can\u2019t argue your way out of this one! She\u2019s obviously stupid for you. And you\u2019re just plain stupid, so it\u2019s a great match.\u201d", "I sighed. \u201cSim, I\u2019m happy to have her as a friend. She\u2019s a delightful person and I\u2019m glad to spend time with her. That\u2019s all there is.\u201d I forced the proper amount of jovial unconcern into my voice so Sim would take me at my word and drop the subject for the time being.", "Sim looked at me for a moment, then shrugged it off. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case,\u201d he said, gesturing with his piece of chicken, \u201cFela talks about you all the time. Thinks you\u2019re a hell of a guy. Plus the whole saving her life thing. I\u2019m pretty sure you have a chance there.\u201d", "I shrugged, watching the patterns the wind made in the fountain\u2019s spray.", "\u201cYou know what we should ...\u201d Sim stopped midthought, staring past me, his expression going suddenly blank.", "I turned to see what he was looking at and saw my lute case, empty. My lute was gone. I looked around wildly, ready to spring to my feet and dash off searching for it. But there was no need\u2014a few feet away stood Ambrose and a few of his friends. He held my lute loosely in one hand.", "\u201cOh, merciful Tehlu,\u201d Simmon muttered behind me. Then at a normal volume he said, \u201cGive it back, Ambrose.\u201d", "\u201cQuiet, E\u2019lir,\u201d Ambrose snapped. \u201cThis is none of your concern.\u201d", "I got to my feet, keeping my eyes on him, on my lute. I had come to think of Ambrose as taller than me, but when I stood I saw that we were eye level with each other. Ambrose seemed a bit surprised as well.", "\u201cGive it to me,\u201d I said, and stretched out my hand. I was surprised to see that it wasn\u2019t shaking. I was shaking inside: half fear, half fury.", "Two parts of me tried to speak at the same time. The first part cried, Please don\u2019t do anything to it. Not again. Don\u2019t break it. Please give it back. Don\u2019t hold it by the neck like that. The other half of me was chanting, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, like spitting out mouthfuls of blood.", "I took a step forward. \u201cGive it to me.\u201d My voice sounded odd to my own ears, emotionless and flat. Flat as my outstretched palm. I had stopped shaking inside.", "He paused for a moment, caught unaware by something in my tone. I could sense his unease\u2014I wasn\u2019t acting the way he had expected. Behind me, I could hear Wilem and Simmon hold their breath. Behind Ambrose, his friends paused, suddenly unsure.", "Ambrose smiled and cocked an eyebrow. \u201cBut I\u2019ve written a song for you, and it needs to be accompanied.\u201d He gripped the lute roughly and dragged his fingers across the strings with no thought for rhythm or tune. People stopped to watch as he sang:", "\u201cThere once was a ravel named Kvothe", "Whose tongue was quick at quipping.", "The masters thought him clever", "And rewarded him with whipping.\u201d", "", "", "Quite a few passersby had stopped to watch by this point, smiling and laughing at Ambrose\u2019s little show. Encouraged, Ambrose made a sweeping bow.", "\u201cEveryone sing!\u201d he shouted, raising his hands like an orchestra conductor, gesturing with my lute like a baton.", "I took another step forward. \u201cGive it back, or I will kill you.\u201d At that moment, I meant it in perfect earnest.", "Everything grew quiet again. Seeing he wasn\u2019t going to get the rise he had expected from me, Ambrose affected nonchalance. \u201cSome people have no sense of humor,\u201d he said with a sigh. \u201cCatch.\u201d", "He tossed it to me, but lutes are not meant to be tossed. It twisted awkwardly in the air, and when I grabbed, there was nothing in my hands. Whether he was clumsy or cruel makes not the slightest difference to me. My lute hit the cobblestones bowl first and made a splintering noise.", "The sound reminded me of the terrible noise my father\u2019s lute had made, crushed beneath my body in a soot-streaked alley in Tarbean. I bent to pick it up and it made a noise like a wounded animal. Ambrose half-turned to look back at me and I saw flickers of amusement play across his face.", "I opened my mouth to howl, to cry, to curse him. But something other tore from my throat, a word I did not know and could not remember.", "Then all I could hear was the sound of the wind. It roared into the courtyard like a sudden storm. A nearby carriage slid sideways across the cobblestones, its horses rearing up in panic. Sheet music was torn from someone\u2019s hands to streak around us like strange lightning. I was pushed forward a step. Everyone was pushed by the wind. Everyone but Ambrose, who pinwheeled to the ground as if struck by the hand of God.", "Then everything was still again. Papers fell, twisting like autumn leaves. People looked around, dazed, their hair tousled and clothes in disarray. Several people staggered as they braced against a storm that was no longer there.", "My throat hurt. My lute was broken.", "Ambrose staggered to his feet. He held his arm awkwardly at his side and blood was running down from his scalp. The look of wild, confused fear he gave me was a brief, sweet pleasure. I considered shouting at him again, wondering what would happen. Would the wind come again? Would the ground swallow him up?", "I heard a horse whinnying in panic. People began to pour from the Eolian and the other buildings around the courtyard. Musicians looked around wildly, and everyone was talking at once.", "\u201c... was that?\u201d", "\u201c... notes are all over. Help me before they get ...\u201d", "\u201c... did it.

The door was closed and the curtains drawn. Wilem began to explain what had happened. As he gained speed he switched to Siaru. Kilvin kept nodding along, his face thoughtful. Simmon listened intently, occasionally interjecting a word or two.", "I sat on a stool nearby. My mind was a whirl of confusion and half-formed questions. My throat was sore. My body was weary and full of sour adrenaline. In the middle of it all, deep in the center of my chest, a piece of me burned in anger like a forge coal fanned red and hot. All around me there was a great numbness, as if I were sealed in wax ten inches thick. There was no Kvothe, only the confusion, the anger, and the numbness wrapping them. I was like a sparrow in a storm, unable to find a safe branch to cling to. Unable to control the tumbling motion of my flight.", "Wilem was reaching the end of his explanation when Elodin entered the room without knocking or announcing himself. Wilem fell silent. I spared the Master Namer half a glance then looked back toward the shattered lute in my hands. As I turned it over in my hands, one of its sharp edges cut my finger. I blankly watched the blood well up and fall to the floor.", "Elodin came to stand directly in front of me, not bothering to speak to anyone else. \u201cKvothe?\u201d", "\u201cHe\u2019s not right, Master,\u201d Simmon said, his voice shrill with worry. \u201cHe\u2019s gone all dumb. He won\u2019t say a thing.\u201d While I heard the words, knew they had meaning, even knew the meanings that belonged to them, I couldn\u2019t pull any sense from them.", "\u201cI think he struck his head,\u201d Wilem said. \u201cHe looks at you, but nothing is there. His eyes are like a dog\u2019s eyes.\u201d", "\u201cKvothe?\u201d Elodin repeated.

His dark eyes steadied me somewhat. Slowed the storm inside me. \u201cAerlevsedi,\u201d he said. \u201cSay it.\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d Simmon said somewhere in the distant background. \u201cWind?\u201d", "\u201cAerlevsedi,\u201d Elodin repeated patiently, his dark eyes intent upon my face.", "\u201cAerlevsedi,\u201d I said numbly.", "Elodin closed his eyes briefly, peacefully. As if he were trying to catch a faint strain of music wafting gently on a breeze. Unable to see his eyes, I began to drift. I looked back down toward the broken lute in my hands, but before my gaze wandered too far he caught my chin again, tilting my face up.", "His eyes caught mine. The numbness faded, but the storm still turned inside my head. Then Elodin\u2019s eyes changed. He stopped looking toward me and looked into me. That is the only way I can describe it. He looked deep into me, not into my eyes, but through my eyes. His gaze went into me and settled solidly in my chest, as if he had both his hands inside me, feeling the shape of my lungs, the movement of my heart, the heat of my anger, the pattern of the storm that thundered inside me.", "He leaned forward and his lips brushed my ear. I felt his breath. He spoke ... and the storm stilled. I found a place to land.", "There is a game all children try at some time or another. You fling out your arms and spin round and round, watching as the world blurs. First you are disoriented, but if you continue to spin long enough the world resolves itself, and you are no longer dizzy as you spin with the world blurring around you.", "Then you stop and the world lurches into regular shape. The dizziness strikes you like a thunderclap, everything lurches, moves. The world tilts around you.", "That is what happened when Elodin stilled the storm in my head. Suddenly, violently dizzy I cried out and raised my hands to keep myself from falling sideways, falling upward, falling inward.

The mother owl was gone, but Auri showed me the nest.", "The deeper we went, the stranger things became. The round tunnels for drainage and pipes disappeared and were replaced with squared-off hallways and stairways strewn with rubble. Rotting wooden doors hung off rusted hinges, and there were half-collapsed rooms filled with moldering tables and chairs. One room had a pair of bricked-up windows despite the fact that we were, at my best guess, at least fifty feet below ground.", "Deeper still, we came to Throughbottom, a room like a cathedral, so big that neither Auri\u2019s blue light nor my red one reached the highest peaks of the ceiling. All around us were huge, ancient machines. Some lay in pieces: broken gears taller than a man, leather straps gone brittle with age, great wooden beams that were now explosions of white fungus, huge as hedgerows.", "Other machines were intact but worn by centuries of neglect. I approached an iron block as big as a farmer\u2019s cottage and broke off a single flake of rust large as a dinner plate. Underneath was nothing but more rust. Nearby there were three great pillars covered in green verdigris so thick it looked like moss. Many of the huge machines were beyond identifying, looking more melted than rusted. But I saw something that might have been a waterwheel, three stories tall, lying in a dry canal that ran like a chasm through the middle of the room.", "I had only the vaguest of ideas as to what any of the machines might have done.

Way back when Kvothe was just a pup, he went to the University. But he didn\u2019t live in the University proper, you see, on account of the fact that he was just ordinary folk. He couldn\u2019t afford all the fancy living that went on there.\u201d", "\u201cHow come?\u201d the smith\u2019s prentice asked. \u201cYou said before that Kvothe was so smart they paid him to stay even though he was just ten years old.

But this was a year or two after Kvothe had got all that.

So his gold was all used up by then. So he\u2014\u201d", "\u201cWhat about the diamond?\u201d the boy insisted.", "Old Cob gave the barest of frowns. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got to know, he gave that diamond to a special friend of his. A special lady friend. But that\u2019s a whole different story than the one I\u2019m telling now.\u201d He glared at the boy, who dropped his eyes contritely and spooned up a mouthful of stew.", "Cob continued, \u201cSince Kvothe couldn\u2019t afford all that rich living in the University, he stayed in the town nextby instead, place called Amary.\u201d He shot Chronicler a pointed look. \u201cKvothe had a room in a inn where he got to stay there for free because the widow who owned the place took a shine to him, and he did chores to help earn his keep.\u201d", "\u201cHe played music there too,\u201d Jake added. \u201cHe was all sorts of clever with his lute.\u201d", "\u201cGet your dinner into your gob and let me finish my say,Jacob,\u201d Old Cob snapped. \u201cEveryone knows Kvothe was clever with a lute. That\u2019s why the widow had taken such a shine to him in the first place, and playing music every night was part of his chores.\u201d", "Cob took a quick drink and continued. \u201cSo one day Kvothe was out running errands for the widow, when a fellow pulls out a knife and tells Kvothe if he doesn\u2019t hand over the widow\u2019s money, he\u2019ll spill Kvothe\u2019s guts all over the street.\u201d Cob pointed an imaginary knife at the boy and gave him a menacing look. \u201cNow you\u2019ve got to remember, this is back when Kvothe was just a pup. He ain\u2019t got no sword, and even if he did, he ain\u2019t learned to fight proper from the Adem yet.\u201d", "\u201cSo what did Kvothe do?\u201d the smith\u2019s prentice asked.", "\u201cWell,\u201d Cob leaned back. \u201cIt was the middle of the day, and they were smack in the middle of Amary\u2019s town square. Kvothe was about to call for the constable, but he always had his eyes wide open, you see. And so he noticed that this fellow had white, white teeth....\u201d", "The boy\u2019s eyes grew wide. \u201cHe was a sweet-eater?\u201d", "Cob nodded. \u201cAnd even worse, the fellow was starting to sweat like a hard-run horse, his eyes were wild, and his hands ...\u201d Cob widened his own eyes and held out his hands, making them tremble. \u201cSo Kvothe knew the fellow had the hunger something fierce, and that meant he\u2019d stab his own mum for a bent penny\u201d Cob took another long drink, drawing out the tension.", "\u201cWhatever did he do?\u201d Bast burst out anxiously from the far end of the bar, wringing his hands dramatically. The innkeeper glared at his student.", "Cob continued, \u201cWell, first he hesitates, and the man comes closer with the knife and Kvothe can see the fellow ain\u2019t going to ask again. So Kvothe uses a dark magic that he found locked away in a secret book in the University. He speaks three terrible, secret words and calls up a demon\u2014\u201d", "\u201cA demon?\u201d the prentice\u2019s voice was almost a yelp. \u201cWas it like the one ...", "Cob shook his head, slowly. \u201cOh no, this one weren\u2019t spiderly at all. It was worse. This one was made all of shadows, and when it landed on the fellow it bit him on the chest, right over his heart, and it drank all the blood out of him like you\u2019d suck the juice out of a plum.\u201d", "\u201cBlackened hands, Cob,\u201d Carter said, his voice thick with reproach. \u201cYou\u2019re going to give the boy nightmares. He\u2019ll be carrying around that damn iron stick for a year with all your nonsense stuffed in his head.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s not how I heard it,\u201d Graham said slowly. \u201cI heard there was a woman trapped in a burning house, and Kvothe called up a demon to protect him from the fire. Then he ran inside and pulled the lady out of the fire and she wasn\u2019t burned at all.\u201d", "\u201cListen to yourselves,\u201dJake said, disgusted. \u201cYou\u2019re like kids at Midwinter. \u2018Demons stole my doll.\u2019 \u2018Demons spilled the milk.\u2019 Kvothe didn\u2019t meddle with demons. He was at the University learning all manner of names, right?", "The fellow came at him with a knife and he called out fire and lightning, just like Taborlin the Great.\u201d", "\u201cIt was a demon, Jake,\u201d Cob said angrily. \u201cOtherwise the story don\u2019t make a lick of sense. It was a demon he called up, and it drank up the fellow\u2019s blood, and everyone who saw was powerful shook up by it. Someone told a priest, then the priests went to the constable, and the constable went and pulled him out of the widow\u2019s inn that night. Then they slapped him into jail for consorting with dark forces and such.\u201d", "\u201cFolk probably just saw the fire and thought it was a demon,\u201d Jake persisted. \u201cYou know how folk are.\u201d", "\u201cNo I don\u2019t, Jacob,\u201d Cob snapped, crossing his arms in front of his chest and leaning back against the bar. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me how folk are? Why don\u2019t you just go ahead and tell this whole damn story while ...\u201d", "Cob stopped at the sound of heavy boots clumping on the wooden landing outside. After a pause, someone fumbled with the latch.", "Everyone turned around to look at the door, curious, as all the regular customers were already there. \u201cTwo new faces in one day,\u201d Graham said gently, knowing he was touching on a delicate subject. \u201cLooks like your dry spell might be over, Kote.\u201d", "\u201cRoads must be getting better,\u201d Shep said into his drink, a hint of relief in his voice. \u201cAbout time we got a touch of luck.\u201d", "The latch clicked and the door swung slowly open, moving in a slow arc until it struck the wall. A man stood outside in the dark, as if deciding whether or not to come in.", "\u201cWelcome to the Waystone,\u201d the innkeeper called out from behind the bar. \u201cWhat can we do for you?\u201d", "The man stepped into the light and the farmers\u2019 excitement was smothered by the sight of the piecemeal leather armor and heavy sword that marked a mercenary. A lone mercenary was never reassuring, even in the best of times. Everyone knew that the difference between an unemployed mercenary and a highwayman was mostly one of timing.", "What\u2019s more, it was obvious this mercenary had fallen on hard times. Brownburr clung thick to the bottoms of his pants and the rough leather of his boot\u2019s laces. His shirt was fine linen dyed a deep, royal blue, but mud-spattered and bramble-torn. His hair was a greasy snarl. His eyes were dark and sunken, as if he hadn\u2019t slept in days. He moved a few steps farther into the inn, leaving the door open behind him.", "\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve been on the road a while,\u201d Kvothe said cheerily.", "\u201cWould you like a drink or some dinner?\u201d When the mercenary made no reply, he added, \u201cNone of us would blame you if you wanted to catch a bit of sleep first, either. It looks like you\u2019ve had a rough couple days.\u201d Kvothe glanced at Bast, who slid off his stool and went to close the inn\u2019s front door.", "After slowly looking over everyone sitting at the bar, the mercenary moved to the empty space between Chronicler and Old Cob. Kvothe gave his best innkeeper\u2019s smile as the mercenary leaned heavily against the bar and mumbled something.", "Across the room, Bast froze with his hand on the door handle.", "\u201cBeg your pardon?\u201d Kvothe asked, leaning forward.", "The mercenary looked up, his eyes meeting Kvothe\u2019s then sweeping back and forth behind the bar. His eyes moved sluggishly, as if he had been addled by a blow to the head. \u201cAethin tseh cthystoi scthaiven vei.\u201d", "Kvothe leaned forward, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what was that again?\u201d When nothing was forthcoming from the mercenary, he looked around at the other men at the bar. \u201cDid anyone catch that?\u201d", "Chronicler was looking the mercenary over, eyeing the man\u2019s armor, the empty quiver of arrows, his fine blue linen shirt. The scribe\u2019s stare was intense, but the mercenary didn\u2019t seem to notice.", "\u201cIt\u2019s Siaru,\u201d Cob said knowingly. \u201cFunny. He don\u2019t look like a shim.\u201d", "Shep laughed, shaking his head. \u201cNaw. He\u2019s drunk. My uncle used to talk like that.\u201d He nudged Graham with an elbow. \u201cYou remember my Uncle Tam? God, I\u2019ve never known a man who drank like that.\u201d", "Bast made a frantic, covert gesture from where he stood near the door, but Kvothe was busy trying to catch the mercenary\u2019s eye. \u201cSpeak Aturan?\u201d Kvothe asked slowly. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d", "The mercenary\u2019s eyes rested momentarily on the innkeeper. \u201cAvoi\u2014\u201d he began, then closed his eyes and tilted his head, as if listening. He opened his eyes again. \u201cI ... want...\u201d he began, his voice slow and thick. \u201cI... look ...\u201d He trailed off, his gaze wandering aimlessly around the room, his eyes unfocused.", "\u201cI know him,\u201d Chronicler said.", "Everyone turned to look at the scribe. \u201cWhat?\u201d Shep asked.", "Chronicler\u2019s expression was angry. \u201cThis fellow and four of his friends robbed me about five days ago. I didn\u2019t recognize him at first. He was cleanshaven then, but it\u2019s him.\u201d", "Behind the man\u2019s back, Bast made a more urgent gesture, trying to catch his masters attention, but Kvothe was intent on the befuddled man. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d", "Chronicler gave a hard, humorless laugh. \u201cHe\u2019s wearing my shirt. Ruined it too. Cost me a whole talent. I never even got a chance to wear it.\u201d", "\u201cWas he like this before?\u201d", "Chronicler shook his head. \u201cNot at all. He was almost genteel as highwaymen go. I had him pegged as a low-ranking officer before he deserted.\u201d", "Bast gave up signaling. \u201cReshi!\u201d He called out, a hint of desperation in his voice.", "\u201cJust a moment, Bast,\u201d Kvothe said as he tried to catch the stupefied mercenary\u2019s attention. He waved a hand in front of the man\u2019s face, snapped his fingers. \u201cHello?\u201d", "The man\u2019s eyes followed Kvothe\u2019s moving hand, but seemed oblivious to everything being said around him. \u201cI... am ... look ...\u201d he said slowly. \u201cI look", "\u201cWhat?\u201d Cob demanded testily. \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d", "\u201cLooking ...\u201d the mercenary echoed vaguely.", "\u201cI imagine he\u2019s looking to give me my horse back,\u201d Chronicler said calmly as he took a half step closer to the man and grabbed the hilt of his sword. With a sudden motion he yanked it free, or rather, he tried to. Instead of sliding easily free it of its scabbard, it came halfway out and stuck.", "\u201cNo!\u201d Bast cried from across the room.", "The mercenary stared vaguely at Chronicler, but made no attempt to stop him. Standing awkwardly, still gripping the hilt of the man\u2019s sword, the scribe tugged harder and the sword pulled slowly free. The broad blade was mottled with dried blood and rust.", "Taking a step back, Chronicler regained his composure and leveled the sword at the mercenary. \u201cAnd my horse is just for starters. Afterward I think he\u2019s looking to give me my money back and have a nice chat with the constable.\u201d", "The mercenary looked at the point of the sword where it swayed unsteadily in front of his chest. His eyes followed the gently swaying motion for a long moment.", "\u201cJust leave him be!\u201d Bast\u2019s voice was shrill. \u201cPlease!\u201d", "Cob nodded. \u201cBoy\u2019s right, Devan. Fella\u2019s not right in his head. Don\u2019t go pointing that at him. He looks likely to pass out on top of it.\u201d", "The mercenary absentmindedly lifted a hand. \u201cI am looking ...\u201d he said, brushing the sword aside as if it were a branch blocking his path. Chronicler sucked in a breath and jerked the sword away as the man\u2019s hand ran along the edge of the blade, drawing blood.", "\u201cSee?\u201d Old Cob said. \u201cWhat I tell you? Sod\u2019s a danger to hisself.\u201d", "The mercenary\u2019s head tilted to the side. He held up his hand, examining it. A slow trickle of dark blood made its way down his thumb, where it gathered and swelled for a moment before dripping onto the floor. The mercenary drew a deep breath through his nose, and his glassy sunken eyes came into sudden, sharp focus.", "He smiled wide at Chronicler, all the vagueness gone from his expression. \u201c\u0422\u0435 varaiyn aroi Seathaloi vex mela,\u201d he said in a deep voice.", "\u201cI ... I don\u2019t follow you,\u201d Chronicler said, disconcerted.", "The man\u2019s smile fell away. His eyes hardened, grew angry. \u201cTe-tauren sciyr-loet? Amauen.\u201d", "\u201cI can\u2019t tell what you\u2019re saying,\u201d Chronicler said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t care for your tone.\u201d He brought the sword back up between them, pointing at the man\u2019s chest.", "The mercenary looked down at the heavy, notched blade, his forehead furrowing in confusion. Then sudden understanding spread across his face and the wide smile returned. He threw back his head and laughed.", "It was no human sound. It was wild and exulting, like a hawk\u2019s shrill cry.", "The mercenary brought up his injured hand and grabbed the tip of the sword, moving with such sudden speed that the metal rang dully with the contact. Still smiling, he tightened his grip, bowing the blade. Blood ran from his hand, down the sword\u2019s edge to patter onto the floor.", "Everyone in the room watched in stunned disbelief. The only sound was the faint grating of the mercenary\u2019s finger bones grinding against the bare edges of the blade.", "Looking Chronicler full in the face, the mercenary twisted his hand sharply and the sword broke with a sound like a shattered bell. As Chronicler stared dumbly at the ruined weapon the mercenary took a step forward and laid his empty hand lightly on the scribe\u2019s shoulder.", "Chronicler gave a choked scream and jerked away as if he had been jabbed with a hot poker. He swung the broken sword wildly, knocking the hand away and notching it deep into the meat of the mercenary\u2019s arm. The man\u2019s face showed no pain or fear, or any sign of awareness that he\u2019d been wounded at all.", "Still holding the broken tip of the sword in his bloody hand, the mercenary took another step toward Chronicler.", "Then Bast was there, barreling into the mercenary with one shoulder, striking him with such force that the man\u2019s body shattered one of the heavy barstools before slamming into the mahogany bar. Quick as a blink, Bast grabbed the mercenary\u2019s head with both hands and slammed it into the edge of the bar. Lips pulled back in a grimace, Bast drove the man\u2019s head viciously into the mahogany: once, twice....", "Then, as if Bast\u2019s action had startled everyone awake, chaos erupted in the room. Old Cob pushed himself away from the bar, tipping his stool over as he backed away Graham began shouting something about the constable. Jake tried to bolt for the door and tripped over Cob\u2019s fallen stool, sprawling to the floor in a tangle. The smith\u2019s prentice grabbed for his iron rod and ended up knocking it to the floor where it rolled in a wide arc and came to rest under a table.", "Bast gave a startled yelp and was thrown violently across the room to land on one of the heavy timber tables. It broke under his weight and he lay sprawled in the wreckage, limp as a rag doll. The mercenary came to his feet, blood flowing freely down the left-hand side of his face. He seemed utterly unconcerned as he turned back to Chronicler, still holding the tip of the broken sword in his bleeding hand.", "Behind him, Shep picked up a knife from where it lay next to the half-eaten wheel of cheese. It was just a kitchen knife, its blade about a handspan long. Face grim, the farmer stepped close behind the mercenary and stabbed down hard, driving the whole of the short blade deep into the mercenary\u2019s body where the shoulder meets the neck.", "Instead of collapsing, the mercenary spun around and lashed Shep across the face with the jagged edge of the sword. Blood sprayed and Shep lifted his hands to his face. Then, moving so quickly it was little more than a twitch, the mercenary brought the piece of metal back around, burying it in the farmer\u2019s chest. Shep staggered backward against the bar, then collapsed to the floor with the broken end of the sword still jutting between his ribs.", "The mercenary reached up and curiously touched the handle of the knife lodged in his own neck. His expression more puzzled than angry, he tugged at it. When it didn\u2019t budge, he gave another wild, birdlike laugh.", "As the farmer lay gasping and bleeding on the floor, the mercenary\u2019s attention seemed to wander, as if he had forgotten what he was doing. His eyes slowly wandered around the room, moving lazily past the broken tables, the black stone fireplace, the huge oak barrels. Finally the mercenary\u2019s gaze came to rest on the red-haired man behind the bar. Kvothe did not blanch or back away when the man\u2019s attention settled onto him. Their eyes met.", "The mercenary\u2019s eyes sharpened again, focusing on Kvothe. The wide, humorless smile reappeared, made macabre by the blood running down his face. \u201c\u0422\u0435 aithiyn Seathaloi?\u201d he demanded. \u201c\u0422\u0435 Rhintae?\u201d", "With an almost casual motion, Kvothe grabbed a dark bottle from the counter and flung it across the bar. It struck the mercenary in the mouth and shattered. The air filled with the sharp tang of elderberry, dousing the man\u2019s still-grinning head and shoulders.", "Reaching out one hand, Kvothe dipped a finger into the liquor that spattered the bar. He muttered something under his breath, his forehead furrowed in concentration. He stared intently at the bloody man standing on the other side of the bar.", "Nothing happened.", "The mercenary reached across the bar, catching hold of Kvothe\u2019s sleeve. The innkeeper simply stood, and in that moment his expression held no fear, no anger or surprise. He only seemed weary, numb, and dismayed.", "Before the mercenary could get a grip on Kvothe\u2019s arm, he staggered as Bast tackled him from behind. Bast managed to get one arm around the mercenary\u2019s neck while the other raked at the man\u2019s face. The mercenary let go of Kvothe and laid both hands on the arm that circled his neck, trying to twist away. When the mercenary\u2019s hands touched him, Bast\u2019s face became a tight mask of pain. Teeth bared, he clawed wildly at the mercenary\u2019s eyes with his free hand.", "At the far end of the bar, the smith\u2019s prentice finally retrieved his iron rod from under the table and stretched to his full height. He charged over the fallen stools and strewn bodies on the floor. Bellowing, he lifted the iron rod high over one shoulder.", "Still clinging to the mercenary, Bast\u2019s eyes grew wide with sudden panic as he saw the smith\u2019s prentice approaching. He released his grip and backed away, his feet tangling in the wreckage of the broken barstool. Falling backward, he scuttled madly away from the both of them.", "Turning, the mercenary saw the tall boy charging. He smiled and stretched out a bloody hand. The motion was graceful, almost lazy.", "The smith\u2019s prentice swatted the arm away. When the iron bar struck him, the mercenary\u2019s smile fell away. He clutched at his arm, hissing and spitting like an angry cat.", "The boy swung the iron rod again, striking the mercenary squarely in the ribs. The force of it knocked him away from the bar, and he fell to his hands and knees, screaming like a slaughtered lamb.", "The smith\u2019s prentice grabbed the bar with both hands and brought it down across the mercenary\u2019s back like a man splitting wood. There was the gristly sound of bones cracking. The iron bar rang softly, like a distant, fog-muffled bell.", "Back broken, the bloody man still tried to crawl toward the inn\u2019s door. His face was blank now, his mouth open in a low howl as constant and unthinking as the sound of wind through winter trees. The prentice struck again and again, swinging the heavy iron rod lightly as a willow switch. He scored a deep groove in the wooden floor, then broke a leg, an arm, more ribs. Still the mercenary continued to claw his way toward the door, shrieking and moaning, sounding more animal than human.", "Finally the boy landed a blow to the head and the mercenary went limp. There was a moment of perfect quiet, then the mercenary made a deep, wet, coughing sound and vomited up a foul fluid, thick as pitch and black as ink.", "It was some time before the boy stopped battering at the motionless corpse, and even when he did stop, he held the bar poised over one shoulder, panting raggedly and looking around wildly. As he slowly caught his breath, the sound of low prayers could be heard from the other side of the room where Old Cob crouched against the black stone of the fireplace.", "After a few minutes even the praying stopped, and silence returned to the Waystone Inn.", "", "For the next several hours the Waystone was the center of the town\u2019s attention. The common room was crowded, full of whispers, murmured questions, and broken sobbing. Folk with less curiosity or more propriety stayed outside, peering through the wide windows and gossiping over what they\u2019d heard.", "There were no stories yet, just a roiling mass of rumor. The dead man was a bandit come to rob the inn. He\u2019d come looking for revenge against Chronicler, who\u2019d deflowered his sister off in Abbott\u2019s Ford. He was a woodsman gone rabid. He was an old acquaintance of the innkeeper, come to collect a debt. He was an ex soldier, gone tabard-mad while fighting the rebels off in Resavek.", "Jake and Carter made a point of the mercenary\u2019s smile, and while denner addiction was a city problem, folk had still heard of sweet-eaters here. Three-finger Tom knew about these things, as he\u2019d soldiered under the old king nearly thirty years ago. He explained that with four grains of denner resin, a man could have his foot amputated without a twinge of pain. With eight grains he\u2019d saw through the bone himself. With twelve grains he\u2019d go for a jog afterward, laughing and singing \u201cTinker Tanner.\u201d", "Shep\u2019s body was covered with a blanket and prayed over by the priest. Later, the constable looked at it as well, but the man was clearly out of his depth, and was looking because he felt he should rather than because he knew what to look for.", "The crowd began to thin after an hour or so. Shep\u2019s brothers showed up with a cart to collect the body. Their grim, red-eyed stares drove away most of the remaining spectators who were idling about.", "Still, there was much to be done. The constable tried to piece together what had happened from witnesses and the more opinionated onlookers. After hours of speculation, the story finally began to coalesce. Eventually it was agreed that the man was a deserter and denner addict come to their little town just in time to go crazy.", "It was clear to everyone that the smith\u2019s prentice had done the right thing, a brave thing in fact. Still, the iron law demanded a trial, so there\u2019d be one next month, when the quarter court came through these parts on its rounds.", "The constable went home to his wife and children. The priest took the mercenary\u2019s remains off to the church. Bast cleared the wrecked furniture away, stacking it near the kitchen door to be used as firewood. The innkeeper mopped the inn\u2019s hardwood floor seven times, until the water in the bucket no longer tinged red when he rinsed it out. Eventually even the most dedicated gawkers drifted away, leaving the usual Felling night crowd, minus one.", "Jake, Cob, and the rest made halting conversation, speaking of everything other than what had happened, clinging to the comfort of each other\u2019s company.", "One by one, exhaustion drove them out of the Waystone. Eventually only the smith\u2019s prentice remained, looking down into the cup in his hands. The iron rod lay near his elbow on the top of the mahogany bar.", "Nearly half an hour passed without anyone speaking. Chronicler sat at a nearby table, making a pretense of finishing a bowl of stew. Kvothe and Bast puttered about, trying to look busy. A vague tension built in the room as they snuck glances at each other, waiting for the boy to leave.", "The innkeeper strolled over to the boy, wiping his hands on a clean linen cloth. \u201cWell boy, I guess\u2014\u201d", "\u201cAaron,\u201d the smith\u2019s prentice interjected, not looking up from his drink. \u201cMy name\u2019s Aaron.\u201d", "Kvothe nodded seriously. \u201cAaron, then. I suppose you deserve that.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t think it was denner,\u201d Aaron said abruptly.", "Kvothe paused. \u201cBeg pardon?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t think that fellow was a sweet-eater.\u201d", "\u201cYou with Cob then?\u201d Kvothe asked. \u201cThink he was rabid?\u201d", "\u201cI think he had a demon in him,\u201d the boy said with careful deliberation, as if he\u2019d been thinking about the words for a long time. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything before \u2019cause I didn\u2019t want folk to think I\u2019d gone all cracked in the head like Crazy Martin.\u201d He looked up from his drink. \u201cBut I still think he had a demon in him.\u201d", "Kvothe put on a gentle smile and gestured to Bast and Chronicler. \u201cAren\u2019t you worried we\u2019ll think the same?\u201d", "Aaron shook his head seriously. \u201cYou aren\u2019t from around here. You\u2019ve been places. You know what sort of things are out in the world.\u201d He gave Kvothe a flat look. \u201cI figure you know it was a demon too.\u201d", "Bast grew still where he stood sweeping near the hearth. Kvothe tilted his head curiously without looking away. \u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d", "The smith\u2019s prentice gestured behind the bar. \u201cI know you got a big oak drunk-thumper under the bar there. And, well...\u201d His eyes flickered upward to the sword hanging menacingly behind the bar. \u201cThere\u2019s only one reason I can think you\u2019d grab a bottle instead of that. You weren\u2019t trying to knock that fellow\u2019s teeth in. You were gonta light him on fire. \u2019Cept you didn\u2019t have any matches, and there weren\u2019t any candles closeby\u201d", "\u201cMy ma used to read to me from the Book of the Path,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of demons in there. Some hide in men\u2019s bodies, like we\u2019d hide under a sheepskin. I think he was just some regular fella who\u2019d got a demon inside him. That\u2019s why nothing hurt him. It\u2019d be like someone poking holes in your shirt. That\u2019s why he din\u2019t make no sense, either. He was talking demon talk.\u201d", "Aaron\u2019s eyes slid back to the cup he held in his hands, nodding to himself. \u201cThe more I think, the better it makes sense. Iron and fire. That\u2019s for demons.\u201d", "\u201cSweet-eaters are stronger than you\u2019d think,\u201d Bast said from across the room. \u201cOnce I saw\u2014\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cIt was a demon.\u201d", "Aaron looked up to meet Kvothe\u2019s eye, then nodded and looked down into his mug again. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t say anything because you\u2019re new in town, and business is shy enough.\u201d", "Kvothe nodded.", "\u201cAnd it won\u2019t do me any good to tell folk, will it?\u201d", "Kvothe drew a deep breath, then let it out slow. \u201cProbably not.\u201d", "Aaron drank off the last swallow of his beer and pushed the empty mug away from himself on the bar. \u201cAlright. I just needed to hear it. Needed to know I hadn\u2019t gone all crazy.\u201d He came to his feet and picked up the heavy iron rod with one hand resting it on his shoulder as he turned toward the door. No one spoke as he made his way across the room and let himself out, closing the door behind him. His heavy boots sounded hollowly on the wooden landing outside, then there was nothing.", "\u201cThere\u2019s more to that one than I would\u2019ve guessed,\u201d Kvothe said at last.", "\u201cIt\u2019s because he\u2019s big,\u201d Bast said matter-of-factly as he gave up the pretense of sweeping. \u201cYou people are easily confused by the look of things. I\u2019ve had my eye on him for a while now. He\u2019s cleverer than folk give him credit for. Always looking at things and asking questions.\u201d He carried the broom back toward the bar. \u201cHe makes me nervous.\u201d", "Kvothe looked amused. \u201cNervous? You?\u201d", "\u201cThe boy reeks of iron. Spends all day handling it, baking it, breathing its smoke. Then comes in here with clever eyes.\u201d Bast gave a profoundly disapproving look. \u201cIt\u2019s not natural.\u201d", "\u201cNatural?\u201d Chronicler finally spoke up. There was a tinge of hysteria in his voice. \u201cWhat do you know about natural? I just saw a demon kill a man, was that natural?\u201d Chronicler turned to face Kvothe. \u201cWhat the hell was that thing doing here anyway?\u201d Chronicler asked.", "\u201c \u2018Looking,\u2019 apparently,\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cThat\u2019s about all I got. How about you, Bast? Could you understand it?\u201d", "Bast shook his head. \u201cI recognized the sound more than anything, Reshi. Its phrasing was very old, archaic. I couldn\u2019t make heads or tails of it.\u201d", "\u201cFine. It was looking,\u201d Chronicler said abruptly. \u201cLooking for what?\u201d", "\u201cMe, probably,\u201d Kvothe said grimly.", "\u201cReshi,\u201d Bast admonished him, \u201cyou\u2019re just being maudlin. This isn\u2019t your fault.\u201d", "Kvothe gave his student a long, weary look. \u201cYou know better than that, Bast. All of this is my fault. The scrael, the war. All my fault.\u201d", "Bast looked like he wanted to protest, but couldn\u2019t find the words. After a long moment, he looked away, beaten.", "Kvothe leaned his elbows onto the bar, sighing, \u201cWhat do you think it was, anyway?\u201d", "Bast shook his head. \u201cIt seemed like one of the Mahael-uret, Reshi. A skin dancer.\u201d He frowned as he said it, sounding anything but certain.", "Kvothe raised an eyebrow. \u201cIt isn\u2019t one of your kind?\u201d", "Bast\u2019s normally affable expression sharpened into a glare. \u201cIt was not \u2018my kind,\u2019 \u201d he said indignantly. \u201cThe Mael doesn\u2019t even share a border with us. It\u2019s as far away as anywhere can be in the Fae.\u201d", "Kvothe nodded a hint of an apology. \u201cI just assumed you knew what it was. You didn\u2019t hesitate to attack it.\u201d", "\u201cAll snakes bite, Reshi. I don\u2019t need their names to know they\u2019re dangerous. I recognized it as being from the Mael. That was enough.\u201d", "\u201cSo, probably a skin dancer?\u201d Kvothe mused. \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me they\u2019d been gone for ages and ages?\u201d", "Bast nodded. \u201cAnd it seemed sort of... dumb, and it didn\u2019t try to escape into a new body.\u201d Bast shrugged. \u201cPlus, we\u2019re all still alive. That seems to indicate that it was something else.\u201d", "Chronicler watched the conversation incredulously. \u201cYou mean neither of you know what it was?\u201d He looked at Kvothe. \u201cYou told the boy it was a demon!\u201d", "\u201cFor the boy it\u2019s a demon,\u201d Kvothe said, \u201cbecause that\u2019s the easiest thing for him to understand, and it\u2019s close enough to the truth.\u201d He began to slowly polish the bar. \u201cFor everyone else in town it\u2019s a sweet-eater because that will let them get some sleep tonight.\u201d", "\u201cWell it\u2019s a demon for me too then,\u201d Chronicler said sharply. \u201cBecause my shoulder feels like ice where it touched me.\u201d", "Bast hurried over. \u201cI forgot it got a hand on you. Let me see.\u201d", "Kvothe closed the window\u2019s shutters while Chronicler removed his shirt; there were bandages stripping the backs of his arms from where he had been wounded by the scrael three nights ago.", "Bast looked closely at his shoulder. \u201cCan you move it?\u201d", "Chronicler nodded, rolling it around. \u201cIt hurt like twelve bastards when he touched me, like something was tearing up inside.\u201d He shook his head in irritation at his own description. \u201cNow it just feels strange. Numb. Like it\u2019s asleep.\u201d", "Bast prodded his shoulder with a finger, looking it over dubiously.", "Chronicler looked back at Kvothe. \u201cThe boy was right about the fire, wasn\u2019t he? Until he mentioned it, I didn\u2019t underaaaaggghhhh!\u201d the scribe shouted, jerking away from Bast. \u201cWhat in God\u2019s name was that?\u201d he demanded.", "\u201cYour brachial nerve plexus, I\u2019m guessing,\u201d Kvothe said dryly.", "\u201cI needed to see how deep the damage went,\u201d Bast said, unruffled. \u201cReshi? Would you get me some goose grease, garlic, mustard.... Do we have any of those green things that smell like onions but aren\u2019t?\u201d", "Kvothe nodded. \u201cKeveral? I think there\u2019s a few left.\u201d", "\u201cBring them, and a bandage too. I should get a salve on this.\u201d", "Kvothe nodded and stepped through the doorway behind the bar.

About the sympathy he tried to do.\u201d", "\u201cSo he was trying to light that thing on fire? Why didn\u2019t it work? What\u2019s\u2014\u201d", "Bast tightened his grip, his thumb digging into the hollow beneath Chronicler\u2019s collarbone.

I can hear him howling all the way in the back,\u201d Kvothe called from the kitchen. Bast stood upright and pulled Chronicler straight in his chair as the innkeeper emerged from the doorway \u201cTehlu anyway, he\u2019s white as a sheet.

The Woods didn\u2019t resemble a forest in any way. It was just a series of crumbling halls and rooms where ceilings were propped up with thick wooden support beams. Cricklet had a tiny trickle of fresh water running down one wall. The moisture attracted crickets, who filled the long low room with their tiny songs. Vaults was a narrow hallway with three deep cracks running across the floor. I only understood the name after watching Auri jump all three in quick secession to make it to the other end.", "It was several days before Auri took me to Belows, a maze of intersecting tunnels. Despite the fact that we were at least a hundred feet below ground, they were filled with a steady, rushing wind that smelled of dust and leather.", "The wind was the clue I needed.

Of course. I grinned back, laughing.", "That minor mystery put to rest, Auri and I began a meticulous investigation of Billows.

The tunnels twisted, leading in wide, unhelpful detours. Those rare times when I found a tunnel that stayed true to its course, the way was blocked.

The darkness is absolute, almost tangible. It lurks outside the light, waiting to rush in like a sudden flood. The air is still and stale. There\u2019s no noise except what you make yourself. Your breathing becomes loud in your own ears. Your heart thumps. And all the while there is the overwhelming knowledge that thousands of tons of earth and stone are pressing down above you.", "Still I continued to worm my way ahead, moving by inches. My hands were grimy, and sweat dripped into my eyes. The crawlway grew smaller yet, and I foolishly let one of my arms get pinned to my side. Cold sweat burst out across my whole body as I panicked. I struggled, trying to get it stretched out in front of me....", "After several terrifying minutes I managed to get my arm free. Then, after lying there for a moment, trembling in the dark, I pressed ahead.", "And found what I\u2019d been looking for....", "", "After emerging from the Underthing, I made my careful way through a window and a locked door into the women\u2019s wing of the Mews. I knocked softly on Fela\u2019s door, not wanting to wake anyone accidentally. Men were not allowed unescorted in the women\u2019s wing of the Mews, especially not during the late hours of night.", "I knocked three times before I heard a gentle stirring in her room. After a moment, Fela opened the door, her long hair in wild disarray. Her eyes were still half-closed as she peered into the hallway with a puzzled expression. She blinked when she saw me standing there, as if she hadn\u2019t really expected anyone.", "She was unmistakably naked, with a bedsheet half-wrapped around herself. I will admit that the sight of gorgeous, full-breasted Fela half-naked in front of me was one of the most startlingly erotic moments in my young life.", "\u201cKvothe?\u201d she said, maintaining a remarkable degree of composure. She tried to cover herself more fully and met with mixed success, pulling the sheet up to her neck in exchange for exposing a scandalous amount of long, shapely leg. \u201cWhat time is it? How did you get in here?\u201d", "\u201cYou said that if I ever needed anything, I could call on you for a favor,\u201d I said urgently. \u201cDid you mean it?\u201d", "\u201cWell, yes. Of course,\u201d she said. \u201cGod, you\u2019re a mess. What happened to you?\u201d", "I looked down at myself, only then realizing the state I was in. I was grimy, the front of my body streaked with dirt from sliding across the floor. I\u2019d torn open my pants across one knee, and it looked like I was bleeding underneath. I\u2019d been so excited that I hadn\u2019t even noticed or thought to change into my new clothes before I came.", "Fela took a half step back and swung the door wider, making room for me to enter. As it opened, the door made a tiny wind that pressed the sheet against her body, outlining her nudity in perfect profile for a moment. \u201cDo you need to come in?\u201d", "\u201cI can\u2019t stay,\u201d I said without thinking, struggling against the urge to gawk openly \u201cI need you to meet a friend of mine in the Archives tomorrow evening. Fifth bell, by the four-plate door. Can you do that?\u201d", "\u201cI have class,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if it\u2019s important, I can skip it.\u201d", "\u201cThank you,\u201d I said quietly as I backed away.", "It says a great deal about what I had found in the tunnels underneath the University that I was halfway back to my room at Anker\u2019s before I realized I had turned down an invitation from a near-naked Fela to join her in her room.", "", "The next day Fela skipped her lecture on Advanced Geometries and made her way to the Archives. She climbed down several flights of stairs and through a maze of corridors and shelves to find the only section of stone wall in the entire building that wasn\u2019t lined with books. The four-plate door stood there, silent and immobile as a mountain: Valaritas.", "Fela looked around nervously, shifting her weight from foot to foot.", "After a long moment, a hooded figure stepped out of the dark and into the ruddy light of her hand lamp.", "She smiled anxiously. \u201cHello,\u201d she said softly \u201cA friend asked me to ...\u201d she paused and ducked her head a little, trying to glimpse the face under the shadow of the hood.", "You probably wouldn\u2019t be surprised at who she saw.", "\u201cKvothe?\u201d she said incredulously, looking around in sudden panic. \u201cMy God, what are you doing in here?\u201d", "\u201cTrespassing,\u201d I said flippantly.", "She grabbed hold of me and pulled me through a maze of shelves until we came to one of the reading holes scattered throughout the Archives. She pushed me in and closed the door firmly behind us and leaned against it. \u201cHow did you get in here? Lorren will burst a vessel! Do you want to get us both expelled?\u201d", "\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t expel you,\u201d I said easily. \u201cYou\u2019re guilty of Willful Collusion at the very most. They can\u2019t expel you for that. You\u2019d probably get off with a fine, since they don\u2019t whip women.\u201d I shifted my shoulders a little, feeling the dull tug of the stitches across my back. \u201cWhich seems a little unfair if you ask me.\u201d", "\u201cHow did you get in here?\u201d she repeated. \u201cDid you sneak past the desk?\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re better off not knowing,\u201d I hedged.", "It had been Billows, of course. Once I smelled old leather and dust on the wind there I knew I was close. Hidden away in the maze of tunnels was a door that lead directly into the lowest level of the stacks. It was there so the scrivs would have easy access to the ventilation system. The door had been locked, of course, but locked doors have never proved much of a hindrance to me. More\u2019s the pity.", "I didn\u2019t tell Fela any of that, however. I knew my secret route would only work as long as it remained secret. Telling a scriv, even a scriv who owed me a favor, simply wasn\u2019t a good idea.", "\u201cListen,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s safe as houses. I\u2019ve been here for hours and no one\u2019s come even close to me. Everyone carries their own light so it\u2019s easy to avoid them.\u201d", "\u201cYou just surprised me,\u201d Fela said, as she brushed her dark hair back over her shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re right though, it\u2019s probably safer out there.\u201d She opened the door and peered outside, making sure the coast was clear. \u201cScrivs spot-check the reading holes periodically to make sure no one\u2019s sleeping in here, or having sex.\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot you don\u2019t know about the Archives.\u201d She smiled as she opened the door the rest of the way.", "\u201cThat\u2019s why I need your help,\u201d I said as we headed out into the stacks. \u201cI can\u2019t make heads or tails of this place.\u201d", "\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d Fela asked.", "\u201cAbout a thousand things,\u201d I said honestly. \u201cBut we can start with the history of the Amyr. Or any nonfictional reports of the Chandrian. Anything about either one really. I haven\u2019t been able to find a thing.\u201d", "I didn\u2019t bother trying to keep the frustration from my voice. To finally get inside the Archives after all this time and not be able to find any of the answers I was looking for was maddening. \u201cI thought things would be better organized,\u201d I groused.", "Fela chuckled deep in her throat. \u201cAnd how would you do that, exactly? Organize everything, I mean.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it for the last couple hours, actually,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019d be best to do it by subject. You know: histories, memoirs, grammars....\u201d", "Fela stopped walking and gave a deep sigh. \u201cI guess we should get this over with.\u201d She pulled a slim book off a shelf at random. \u201cWhat\u2019s the subject of this book?\u201d", "I opened it and glanced over the pages. It was written in an old scribe\u2019s hand, spidery and hard to follow. \u201cIt looks like a memoir.\u201d", "\u201cWhat type of memoir? Where do you put it in relationship to the other memoirs?\u201d", "Still flipping pages, I spotted a carefully drawn map. \u201cActually, it looks more like a travelogue.\u201d", "\u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere do you put it in the memoir-travelogue-section?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019d organize them geographically,\u201d I said, enjoying the game. I flipped more pages. \u201cAtur, Modeg, and ... Vint?\u201d I frowned and looked at the spine of the book. \u201cHow old is this? The Aturan Empire absorbed Vint over three hundred years ago.\u201d", "\u201cOver four hundred years,\u201d she corrected. \u201cSo where do you put a travelogue that refers to a place that doesn\u2019t exist any more?\u201d", "\u201cIt would be more of a history, really,\u201d I said more slowly.", "\u201cWhat if it isn\u2019t accurate?\u201d Fela pressed. \u201cBased on hearsay rather than personal experience? What if it\u2019s purely fictional? Novel travelogues were quite a fashion in Modeg a couple hundred years ago.\u201d", "I closed the book and slowly slid it back onto the shelf. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to see the problem,\u201d I said thoughtfully.", "\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d Fela said frankly. \u201cYou\u2019re just glimpsing the edges of the problem.\u201d She gestured to the stacks around us. \u201cLet\u2019s say you became Master Archivist tomorrow. How long would it take you to organize all this?\u201d", "I looked around at the countless shelves retreating off into the darkness. \u201cIt would be a lifetime\u2019s work.\u201d", "\u201cEvidence suggests it takes more than just one lifetime,\u201d Fela said dryly \u201cThere are over three quarters of a million volumes here, and that\u2019s not even taking into consideration the clays or scrolls or fragments from Caluptena.\u201d", "She made a dismissive gesture. \u201cSo you spend years developing the perfect organizational system, which even has a convenient place for your historical-fictional-travelogue-memoir. You and the scrivs spend decades slowly identifying, sorting and reordering tens of thousands of books.\u201d She looked me in the eye. \u201cAnd then you die. What happens then?\u201d", "I began to see where she was going. \u201cWell, in a perfect world, the next Master Archivist would pick up where I left off,\u201d I said.", "\u201cHurrah for the perfect world,\u201d Fela said sarcastically, then turned and began leading me through the shelves again.", "\u201cI\u2019m guessing the new Master Archivist usually has his own ideas about how to organize things?\u201d", "\u201cNot usually,\u201d Fela admitted. \u201cSometimes there are a several in a row who work toward the same system. But sooner or later you get someone who\u2019s sure they have a better way of doing things and everything starts from scratch again.\u201d", "\u201cHow many different systems have there been?\u201d I spotted a faint red light bobbing in the distant shelves and pointed towards it.", "Fela changed directions to take us away from the light and whoever was carrying it. \u201cIt depends on how you count them,\u201d she said softly \u201cAt least nine in the last three hundred years. The worst was about fifty years ago when there were four new Master Archivists within five years of each other. The result was three different factions among the scrivs, each using a different cataloging system, each firmly believing theirs was the best.\u201d", "\u201cSounds like a civil war,\u201d I said.", "\u201cA holy war,\u201d Fela said. \u201cA very quiet, circumspect crusade where each side was sure they were protecting the immortal soul of the Archives. They would steal books that had already been cataloged in each other\u2019s systems. They would hide books from each other, or confuse their order on the shelves.\u201d", "\u201cHow long did this go on?\u201d", "\u201cAlmost fifteen years,\u201d Fela said. \u201cIt might still be going on today if Master Tolem\u2019s scrivs hadn\u2019t finally managed to steal the Larkin ledger books and burn them. The Larkins couldn\u2019t keep going after that.\u201d", "\u201cAnd the moral of the story is that people get passionate around books?\u201d I teased gently. \u201cHence the need to spot-check the reading holes?\u201d", "Fela stuck out her tongue at me. \u201cThe moral of the story is that things are a mess in here. We effectively \u2018lost\u2019 almost two hundred thousand books when Tolem burned the Larkin ledgers. They were the only records on where those books were located. Then, five years later, Tolem dies.

Whoever\u2019s working on the new house keeps stealing lumber from what\u2019s been built before. The old systems are still there in scattered bits and pieces.

My progress was so nonexistent that I wondered at times if there was any progress to be made at all.", "What time I didn\u2019t spend studying or in the Archives I spent on the road to Imre, braving the coming winter wind, if not looking for its name. The Eolian was always my best bet for finding Denna, and as the weather worsened I found her there more and more. By the time the first snow fell, I usually managed to catch her one trip of three.", "Unfortunately, I rarely managed to have her wholly to myself, as she usually had someone with her. As Deoch had mentioned, she was not the sort who spent a lot of time alone.", "Still I kept coming. Why? Because whenever she saw me some light would go on inside her, making her glow for a moment. She would jump to her feet, run to me, and catch hold of my arm. Then, smiling, bring me back to her table and introduce me to her newest man.", "I came to know most of them. None were good enough for her, so I held them in contempt and hated them. They in turn hated and feared me.", "But we were pleasant to each other. Always pleasant. It was a game of sorts.

His mouth would narrow as he listened to the laughter that leapt from her as I joked, spun stories, sang....", "They would always react the same way, trying to prove ownership of her in small ways. Holding her hand, a kiss, a too-casual touch along her shoulder.", "They clung to her with desperate determination. Some of them merely resented my presence, saw me as a rival. But others had a frightened knowledge buried deep behind their eyes from the beginning. They knew she was leaving, and they didn\u2019t know why. So they clutched at her like shipwrecked sailors, clinging to the rocks despite the fact that they are being battered to death against them. I almost felt sorry for them. Almost.", "So they hated me, and it shone in their eyes when Denna wasn\u2019t looking. I would offer to buy another round of drinks, but he would insist, and I would graciously accept, and thank him, and smile.", "I have known her longer, my smile said. True, you have been inside the circle of her arms, tasted her mouth, felt the warmth of her, and that is something I have never had. But there is a part of her that is only for me. You cannot touch it, no matter how hard you might try. And after she has left you I will still be here, making her laugh. My light shining in her. I will still be here long after she has forgotten your name.", "There were more than a few. She went through them like a pen through wet paper. She left them, disappointed. Or, frustrated, they abandoned her, leaving her heartsore, moved to sadness but never as far as tears.", "There were tears once or twice. But they were not for the men she had lost or the men she had left. They were quiet tears for herself, because there was something inside her that was badly hurt.

He removed the finished pages from his satchel and stowed them safely in the heavy wooden chest of drawers. Then he cleaned all his pen\u2019s nibs and set them out to dry. He carefully removed the bandage on his shoulder, threw the foul-smelling thing in the chamber pot, and replaced the lid before washing his shoulder clean in the hand basin.", "Yawning, he went to the window and looked out at the little town, but there was nothing to see.

That doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d", "Bast frowned and made a dismissive gesture. \u201cYou know what I mean. He can\u2019t know that I\u2019m here.\u201d Bast sat on the edge of the bed and smoothed down his pants self-consciously.", "Chronicler gripped the blankets bunched around his waist. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d", "\u201cLike I said, we need to talk.\u201d Bast looked at Chronicler seriously \u201cWe need to talk about why you\u2019re here.\u201d", "\u201cThis is what I do,\u201d Chronicler said, irritated. \u201cI collect stories. And when I get the chance I investigate odd rumors and see if there\u2019s any truth behind them.\u201d", "\u201cOut of curiosity, which rumor was it?\u201d Bast asked.", "\u201cApparently you got soppy drunk and let something slip to a wagoneer,\u201d Chronicler said. \u201cRather careless, all things considered.\u201d", "Bast gave Chronicler a profoundly pitying look. \u201cLook at me,\u201d Bast said, as if talking to a child. \u201cThink. Could some wagon herder get me drunk? Me?\u201d", "Chronicler opened his mouth. Closed it. \u201cThen ...\u201d", "\u201cHe was my message in a bottle. One of many. You just happened to be the first person to find one and come looking.\u201d", "Chronicler took a long moment to digest this piece of information. \u201cI thought you two were hiding?\u201d", "\u201cOh we\u2019re hiding alright,\u201d Bast said bitterly. \u201cWe\u2019re tucked away so safe and sound that he\u2019s practically fading into the woodwork.\u201d", "\u201cI can understand you feeling a little stifled around here,\u201d Chronicler said. \u201cBut honestly, I don\u2019t see what your master\u2019s bad mood has do to with the price of butter.\u201d", "Bast\u2019s eyes flashed angrily. \u201cIt has everything to do with the price of butter!\u201d he said through his teeth. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a damn sight more than a bad mood, you ignorant, wretched anhaut-fehn. This place is killing him.\u201d", "Chronicler went pale at Bast\u2019s outburst. \u201cI ... I\u2019m not ...\u201d", "Bast closed his eyes and drew a deep breath, obviously trying to calm himself. \u201cYou just don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said, speaking to himself as much as Chronicler. \u201cThat\u2019s why I came, to explain. I\u2019ve been waiting for months for someone to come. Anyone. Even old enemies come to settle scores would be better than him wasting away like this. But you\u2019re better than I\u2019d hoped for. You\u2019re perfect.\u201d", "\u201cPerfect for what?\u201d Chronicler asked. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what the problem is.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s like ... have you ever heard the story of Martin Maskmaker?\u201d Chronicler shook his head and Bast gave a frustrated sigh. \u201cHow about plays? Have you seen The Ghost and the Goosegirl or The Ha\u2019penny King?\u201d", "Chronicler frowned. \u201cIs that the one where the king sells his crown to an orphan boy?\u201d", "Bast nodded. \u201cAnd the boy becomes a better king than the original. The goosegirl dresses like a countess and everyone is stunned by her grace and charm.\u201d He hesitated, struggling to find the words he wanted. \u201cYou see, there\u2019s a fundamental connection between seeming and being. Every Fae child knows this, but you mortals never seem to see. We understand how dangerous a mask can be. We all become what we pretend to be.\u201d", "Chronicler relaxed a bit, sensing familiar ground. \u201cThat\u2019s basic psychology. You dress a beggar in fine clothes, people treat him like a noble, and he lives up to their expectations.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s only the smallest piece of it,\u201d Bast said. \u201cThe truth is deeper than that. It\u2019s ...\u201d Bast floundered for a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s like everyone tells a story about themselves inside their own head. Always. All the time. That story makes you what you are. We build ourselves out of that story.\u201d", "Frowning, Chronicler opened his mouth, but Bast held up a hand to stop him. \u201cNo, listen. I\u2019ve got it now. You meet a girl: shy, unassuming. If you tell her she\u2019s beautiful, she\u2019ll think you\u2019re sweet, but she won\u2019t believe you. She knows that beauty lies in your beholding.\u201d Bast gave a grudging shrug. \u201cAnd sometimes that\u2019s enough.\u201d", "His eyes brightened. \u201cBut there\u2019s a better way. You show her she is beautiful. You make mirrors of your eyes, prayers of your hands against her body. It is hard, very hard, but when she truly believes you ...\u201d Bast gestured excitedly. \u201cSuddenly the story she tells herself in her own head changes. She transforms. She isn\u2019t seen as beautiful. She is beautiful, seen.\u201d", "\u201cWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d Chronicler snapped. \u201cYou\u2019re just spouting nonsense now.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m spouting too much sense for you to understand,\u201d Bast said testily. \u201cBut you\u2019re close enough to see my point. Think of what he said today. People saw him as a hero, and he played the part. He wore it like a mask but eventually he believed it. It became the truth. But now ...\u201d he trailed off.", "\u201cNow people see him as an innkeeper,\u201d Chronicler said.", "\u201cNo,\u201d Bast said softly. \u201cPeople saw him as an innkeeper a year ago. He took off the mask when they walked out the door. Now he sees himself as an innkeeper, and a failed innkeeper at that. You saw what he was like when Cob and the rest came in tonight. You saw that thin shadow of a man behind the bar tonight. It used to be an act....\u201d", "Bast looked up, excited. \u201cBut you\u2019re perfect. You can help him remember what it was like. I haven\u2019t seen him so lively in months. I know you can do it.\u201d", "Chronicler frowned a bit. \u201cI\u2019m not sure....\u201d", "\u201cI know it will work,\u201d Bast said eagerly. \u201cI tried something similar a couple of months ago. I got him to start a memoir.\u201d", "Chronicler perked up. \u201cHe wrote a memoir?\u201d", "\u201cStarted a memoir,\u201d Bast said. \u201cHe was so excited, talked about it for days. Wondering where he should begin his story. After his first night\u2019s writing he was like his old self again. He looked three feet taller with lightning on his shoulders.\u201d Bast sighed. \u201cBut something happened. The next day he read what he\u2019d written and went into one of his dark moods. Claimed the whole thing was the worst idea he\u2019d ever had.\u201d", "\u201cWhat about the pages he wrote?\u201d", "Bast made a crumpling motion with his hands and tossed imaginary papers away.", "\u201cWhat did they say?\u201d Chronicler asked.", "Bast shook his head. \u201cHe didn\u2019t throw them away. He just... threw them. They\u2019ve been lying on his desk for months.\u201d", "Chronicler\u2019s curiosity was almost palpable. \u201cCan\u2019t you just ...\u201d he waggled his fingers. \u201cYou know, tidy them up?\u201d", "\u201cAnpauen. No.\u201d Bast looked horrified. \u201cHe was furious after he read them.\u201d Bast shivered a little. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what he\u2019s like when he\u2019s really angry. I know better than to cross him on something like that.\u201d", "\u201cI suppose you know best,\u201d Chronicler said dubiously", "Bast gave an emphatic nod. \u201cExactly. That\u2019s why I came to talk to you. Because I know best. You need to keep him from focusing on the dark things. If not ...\u201d Bast shrugged and repeated the motion of crumpling and throwing away a piece of paper.", "\u201cBut I\u2019m collecting the story of his life. The real story.\u201d Chronicler made a helpless gesture. \u201cWithout the dark parts it\u2019s just some silly f\u2014\u201d Chronicler froze halfway through the word, eyes darting nervously to the side.", "Bast grinned like a child catching a priest midcurse. \u201cGo on,\u201d he urged, his eyes were delighted, and hard, and terrible. \u201cSay it.\u201d", "\u201cLike some silly faerie story,\u201d Chronicler finished, his voice thin and pale as paper.", "Bast smiled a wide smile. \u201cYou know nothing of the Fae, if you think our stories lack their darker sides. But all that aside, this is a faerie story, because you are gathering it for me.\u201d", "Chronicler swallowed hard and seemed to regain some of his composure. \u201cWhat I mean is that what he\u2019s telling is a true story, and true stories have unpleasant parts. His more than most, I expect. They\u2019re messy, and tangled, and ...\u201d", "\u201cI know you can\u2019t get him to leave them out,\u201d Bast said. \u201cBut you can hurry him along. You can help him dwell on the good things: his adventures, the women, the fighting, his travels, his music....\u201d Bast stopped abruptly. \u201cWell ... not the music. Don\u2019t ask about that, or why he doesn\u2019t do magic anymore.\u201d", "Chronicler frowned. \u201cWhy not? His music seems ...\u201d", "Bast\u2019s expression was grim. \u201cJust don\u2019t,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cThey\u2019re not productive subjects. I stopped you earlier,\u201d he tapped Chronicler\u2019s shoulder meaningfully, \u201cbecause you were going to ask him what went wrong with his sympathy. You didn\u2019t know any better. Now you do. Focus on the heroics, his cleverness.\u201d He waved his hands. \u201cThat sort of thing.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s really not my place to be steering him one way or another,\u201d Chronicler said stiffly. \u201cI\u2019m a recorder. I\u2019m just here for the story. The story\u2019s the important thing, after all.\u201d", "\u201cPiss on your story,\u201d Bast said sharply. \u201cYou\u2019ll do what I say, or I\u2019ll break you like a kindling stick.\u201d", "Chronicler froze. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying I work for you?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m saying you belong to me.\u201d Bast\u2019s face was deadly serious. \u201cDown to the marrow of your bones. I drew you here to serve my purpose. You have eaten at my table, and I have saved your life.\u201d He pointed at Chronicler\u2019s naked chest. \u201cThree ways I own you. That makes you wholly mine. An instrument of my desire. You will do as I say.\u201d", "Chronicler\u2019s chin lifted a bit, his expression hardening. \u201cI will do as I see fit,\u201d he said, slowly raising a hand to the piece of metal that lay against his naked chest.", "Bast\u2019s eyes flickered down, then up again. \u201cYou think I\u2019m playing at some game?\u201d His expression was incredulous. \u201cYou think iron will keep you safe?\u201d Bast leaned forward, slapped Chronicler\u2019s hand away, and grabbed the circle of dark metal before the scribe could move. Immediately Bast\u2019s arm stiffened and his eyes clenched shut in a grimace of pain. When he reopened them they were solid blue, the color of deep water or the darkening sky.", "Bast leaned forward, bringing his face close to Chronicler\u2019s. The scribe panicked and tried to scrabble sideways out of the bed, but Bast took hold of his shoulder and held him fast. \u201cHear my words, manling,\u201d he hissed. \u201cDo not mistake me for my mask. You see light dappling on the water and forget the deep, cold dark beneath.\u201d The tendons in Bast\u2019s hand creaked as he tightened his grip on the circle of iron. \u201cListen. You cannot hurt me. You cannot run or hide. In this I will not be defied.\u201d", "As he spoke, Bast\u2019s eyes grew paler, until they were the pure blue of a clear noontime sky. \u201cI swear by all the salt in me: if you run counter to my desire, the remainder of your brief mortal span will be an orchestra of misery. I swear by stone and oak and elm: I\u2019ll make a game of you. I\u2019ll follow you unseen and smother any spark of joy you find. You\u2019ll never know a woman\u2019s touch, a breath of rest, a moment\u2019s peace of mind.\u201d", "Bast\u2019s eyes were now the pale blue-white of lightning, his voice tight and fierce. \u201cAnd I swear by the night sky and the ever-moving moon: if you lead my master to despair, I will slit you open and splash around like a child in a muddy puddle. I\u2019ll string a fiddle with your guts and make you play it while I dance.\u201d", "Bast leaned closer until their faces were mere inches apart, his eyes gone white as opal, white as a full-bellied moon. \u201cYou are an educated man. You know there are no such things as demons.\u201d Bast smiled a terrible smile. \u201cThere is only my kind.\u201d Bast leaned closer still, Chronicler smelled flowers on his breath. \u201cYou are not wise enough to fear me as I should be feared. You do not know the first note of the music that moves me.\u201d", "Bast pushed himself away from Chronicler and took several steps back from the bed. Standing at the edge of the candle\u2019s flickering light, he opened his hand and the circle of iron fell to the wooden floor, ringing dully. After a moment, Bast drew a slow, deep breath. He ran his hands through his hair.", "Chronicler remained where he was, pale and sweating.", "Bast bent to pick up the iron ring by its broken cord, knotting it together again with quick fingers. \u201cListen, there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t be friends,\u201d he said matter-of-factly as he turned and held the necklace out to Chronicler. His eyes were a human blue again, his smile warm and charming. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t all get what we want. You get your story. He gets to tell it. You get to know the truth. He gets to remember who he really is. Everyone wins, and we all go our separate ways, pleased as peaches.\u201d", "Chronicler reached out to take hold of the cord, his hand trembling slightly \u201cWhat do you get?\u201d he asked, his voice a dry whisper. \u201cWhat do you want out of this?\u201d", "The question seemed to catch Bast unprepared. He stood still and awkward for a moment, all his fluid grace gone. For a moment it looked as if he might burst into tears. \u201cWhat do I want? I just want my Reshi back.\u201d His voice was quiet and lost. \u201cI want him back the way he was.\u201d", "There was a moment of awkward silence. Bast scrubbed at his face with both hands and swallowed hard. \u201cI\u2019ve been gone too long,\u201d he said abruptly, walking to the window and opening it. He paused with one leg over the sill and looked back at Chronicler. \u201cCan I bring you anything before you go to sleep? A nightcap? More blankets?\u201d", "Chronicler shook his head numbly and Bast waved as he stepped the rest of the way out the window, closing it gently behind him.", "", "", ""], "EPILOGUE": ["EPILOGUE", "A Silence of Three Parts", "\nIt was night again. The Waystone Inn lay in silence, and it was a silence of three parts.", "The first part was a hollow, echoing quiet, made by things that were lacking. If there had been horses stabled in the barn they would have stamped and champed and broken it to pieces. If there had been a crowd of guests, even a handful of guests bedded down for the night, their restless breathing and mingled snores would have gently thawed the silence like a warm spring wind. If there had been music ... but no, of course there was no music. In fact there were none of these things, and so the silence remained.", "Inside the Waystone a man huddled in his deep, sweet-smelling bed. Motionless, waiting for sleep, he lay wide-eyed in the dark. In doing this he added a small, frightened silence to the larger, hollow one. They made an alloy of sorts, a harmony.", "The third silence was not an easy thing to notice. If you listened for an hour, you might begin to feel it in the thick stone walls of the empty taproom and in the flat, grey metal of the sword that hung behind the bar. It was in the dim candlelight that filled an upstairs room with dancing shadows. It was in the mad pattern of a crumpled memoir that lay fallen and unforgotten atop the desk. And it was in the hands of the man who sat there, pointedly ignoring the pages he had written and discarded long ago.", "The man had true-red hair, red as flame. His eyes were dark and distant, and he moved with the weary calm that comes from knowing many things.", "The Waystone was his, just as the third silence was his. This was appropriate, as it was the greatest silence of the three, wrapping the others inside itself. It was deep and wide as autumn\u2019s ending. It was heavy as a great river-smooth stone. It was the patient, cut-flower sound of a man who is waiting to die.", "", "", ""]}
