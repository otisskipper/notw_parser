wmf_json = {"PROLOGUE": ["PROLOGUE\nA Silence of Three Parts\nDAWN WAS COMING. The Waystone Inn lay in silence, and it was a silence of three parts.\nThe most obvious part was a vast, echoing quiet made by things that were lacking. If there had been a storm, raindrops would have tapped and pattered against the selas vines behind the inn. Thunder would have muttered and rumbled and chased the silence down the road like fallen autumn leaves. If there had been travelers stirring in their rooms they would have stretched and grumbled the silence away like fraying, half-forgotten dreams. If there had been music . . . but no, of course there was no music. In fact there were none of these things, and so the silence remained.\nInside the Waystone a dark-haired man eased the back door closed behind himself. Moving through the perfect dark, he crept through the kitchen, across the taproom, and down the basement stairs. With the ease of long experience, he avoided loose boards that might groan or sigh beneath his weight. Each slow step made only the barest tep against the floor. In doing this he added his small, furtive silence to the larger echoing one. They made an amalgam of sorts, a counterpoint.\nThe third silence was not an easy thing to notice. If you listened long enough you might begin to feel it in the chill of the window glass and the smooth plaster walls of the innkeeper\u2019s room. It was in the dark chest that lay at the foot of a hard and narrow bed. And it was in the hands of the man who lay there, motionless, watching for the first pale hint of dawn\u2019s coming light.\nThe man had true-red hair, red as flame. His eyes were dark and distant, and he lay with the resigned air of one who has long ago abandoned any hope of sleep.\nThe Waystone was his, just as the third silence was his. This was appropriate, as it was the greatest silence of the three, holding the others inside itself. It was deep and wide as autumn\u2019s ending. It was heavy as a great riversmooth stone. It was the patient, cut-flower sound of a man who is waiting to die.", ""], "CHAPTER ONE": ["CHAPTER ONE\nApple and Elderberry\nBAST SLOUCHED AGAINST THE long stretch of mahogany bar, bored. Looking around the empty room, he sighed and rummaged around until he found a clean linen cloth. Then, with a resigned look, he began to polish a section of the bar.\nAfter a moment Bast leaned forward and squinted at some half-seen speck. He scratched at it and frowned at the oily smudge his finger made. He leaned closer, fogged the bar with his breath, and buffed it briskly. Then he paused, exhaled hard against the wood, and wrote an obscene word in the fog.\nTossing aside the cloth, Bast made his way through the empty tables and chairs to the wide windows of the inn. He stood there for a long moment, looking at the dirt road running through the center of the town.\nBast gave another sigh and began to pace the room. He moved with the casual grace of a dancer and the perfect nonchalance of a cat. But when he ran his hands through his dark hair the gesture was restless. His blue eyes prowled the room endlessly, as if searching for a way out. As if searching for something he hadn\u2019t seen a hundred times before.\nBut there was nothing new. Empty tables and chairs. Empty stools at the bar. Two huge barrels loomed on the counter behind the bar, one for whiskey, one for beer. Between the barrels stood a vast panoply of bottles: all colors and shapes. Above the bottles hung a sword.\nBast\u2019s eyes fell back onto the bottles. He focused on them for a long, speculative moment, then moved back behind the bar and brought out a heavy clay mug.\nDrawing a deep breath, he pointed a finger at the first bottle in the bottom row and began to chant as he counted down the line.\nMaple. Maypole. Catch and carry. Ash and Ember.", "Elderberry.\nHe finished the chant while pointing at a squat green bottle. He twisted out the cork, took a speculative sip, then made a sour face and shuddered. He quickly set the bottle down and picked up a curving red one instead. He sipped this one as well, rubbed his wet lips together thoughtfully, then nodded and splashed a generous portion into his mug.\nHe pointed at the next bottle and started counting again:\nWoolen. Woman. Moon at night. Willow. Window. Candlelight.\nThis time it was a clear bottle with a pale yellow liquor inside. Bast yanked the cork and added a long pour to the mug without bothering to taste it first. Setting the bottle aside, he picked up the mug and swirled it dramatically before taking a mouthful. He smiled a brilliant smile and flicked the new bottle with his finger, making it chime lightly before he began his singsong chant again:\nBarrel. Barley. Stone and stave. Wind and water\u2014\nA floorboard creaked, and Bast looked up, smiling brightly. \u201cGood morning, Reshi.\u201d\nThe red-haired innkeeper stood at the bottom of the stairs. He brushed his long-fingered hands over the clean apron and full-length sleeves he wore. \u201cIs our guest awake yet?\u201d\nBast shook his head. \u201cNot a rustle or a peep.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s had a hard couple of days,\u201d Kote said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably catching up with him.\u201d He hesitated, then lifted his head and sniffed. \u201cHave you been drinking?\u201d The question was more curious than accusatory.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bast said.\nThe innkeeper raised an eyebrow.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been tasting,\u201d Bast said, emphasizing the word. \u201cTasting comes\nbefore drinking.\u201d", "\u201cAh,\u201d the innkeeper said. \u201cSo you were getting ready to drink then?\u201d\n\u201cTiny Gods, yes,\u201d Bast said. \u201cTo great excess. What the hell else is there to do?\u201d Bast brought his mug up from underneath the bar and looked into it. \u201cI was hoping for elderberry, but I got some sort of melon.\u201d He swirled the mug speculatively. \u201cPlus something spicy.\u201d He took another sip and narrowed his eyes thoughtfully. \u201cCinnamon?\u201d he asked, looking at the ranks of bottles. \u201cDo we even have any more elderberry?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s in there somewhere,\u201d the innkeeper said, not bothering to look at the bottles. \u201cStop a moment and listen, Bast. We need to talk about what you did last night.\u201d\nBast went very still. \u201cWhat did I do, Reshi?\u201d\n\u201cYou stopped that creature from the Mael,\u201d Kote said.\n\u201cOh.\u201d Bast relaxed, making a dismissive gesture. \u201cI just slowed it down,\nReshi. That\u2019s all.\u201d\nKote shook his head. \u201cYou realized it wasn\u2019t just some madman.You tried\nto warn us. If you hadn\u2019t been so quick on your feet . . .\u201d\nBast frowned. \u201cI wasn\u2019t so quick, Reshi. It got Shep.\u201d He looked down at\nthe well scrubbed floorboards near the bar. \u201cI liked Shep.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone else will think the smith\u2019s prentice saved us,\u201d Kote said. \u201cAnd\nthat\u2019s probably for the best. But I know the truth. If not for you, it would have slaughtered everyone here.\u201d\n\u201cOh Reshi, that\u2019s just not true,\u201d Bast said. \u201cYou would have killed it like a chicken. I just got it first.\u201d\nThe innkeeper shrugged the comment away. \u201cLast night has me thinking,\u201d he said. \u201cWondering what we could do to make things a bit safer around here. Have you ever heard the \u2018White Riders\u2019 Hunt\u2019?\u201d\nBast smiled. \u201cIt was our song before it was yours, Reshi.\u201d He drew a breath and sang in a sweet tenor:\nRode they horses white as snow. Silver blade and white horn bow. Wore they fresh and supple boughs, Red and green upon their brows.\nThe innkeeper nodded. \u201cExactly the verse I was thinking of. Do you think you could take care of it while I get things ready here?\u201d\nBast nodded enthusiastically and practically bolted, pausing by the kitchen", "door. \u201cYou won\u2019t start without me?\u201d he asked anxiously.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll start as soon as our guest is fed and ready,\u201d Kote said. Then, seeing\nthe expression on his student\u2019s face, he relented a little. \u201cFor all that, I imagine you have an hour or two.\u201d\nBast glanced through the doorway, then back.\nAmusement flickered over the innkeeper\u2019s face. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll call before we start.\u201d He made a shooing motion with one hand. \u201cGo on now.\u201d\nThe man who called himself Kote went through his usual routine at the Waystone Inn. He moved like clockwork, like a wagon rolling down the road in well-worn ruts.\nFirst came the bread. He mixed flour and sugar and salt with his hands, not bothering to measure. He added a piece of starter from the clay jar in the pantry, kneaded the dough, then rounded the loaves and set them to rise. He shoveled ash from the stove in the kitchen and kindled a fire.\nNext he moved into the common room and laid a fire in the black stone fireplace, brushing the ash from the massive hearth along the northern wall. He pumped water, washed his hands, and brought up a piece of mutton from the basement. He cut fresh kindling, carried in firewood, punched down the rising bread and moved it close to the now-warm stove.\nAnd then, abruptly, there was nothing left to do. Everything was ready. Everything was clean and orderly. The red-haired man stood behind the bar, his eyes slowly returning from their faraway place, focusing on the here and now, on the inn itself.\nThey came to rest on the sword that hung on the wall above the bottles. It wasn\u2019t a particularly beautiful sword, not ornate or eye-catching. It was menacing, in a way. The same way a tall cliff is menacing. It was grey and unblemished and cold to the touch. It was sharp as shattered glass. Carved into the black wood of the mounting board was a single word: Folly.\nThe innkeeper heard heavy footsteps on the wooden landing outside. The door\u2019s latch rattled noisily, followed by a loud hellooo and a thumping on the door.\n\u201cJust a moment!\u201d Kote called. Hurrying to the front door he turned, the heavy key in the door\u2019s bright brass lock.\n \nGraham stood with his thick hand poised to knock on the door. His weathered face split into a grin when he saw the innkeeper. \u201cBast open things up for you again this morning?\u201d he asked.\nKote gave a tolerant smile.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good boy,\u201d Graham said. \u201cJust a little ditherheaded. I thought you might have closed up shop today.\u201d He cleared his throat and glanced at his feet for a moment. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised, considering.\u201d\nKote put the key in his pocket. \u201cOpen as always. What can I do for you?\u201d\nGraham stepped out of the doorway and nodded toward the street where three barrels stood in a nearby cart. They were new, with pale, polished wood and bright metal bands. \u201cI knew I wasn\u2019t getting any sleep last night, so I knocked the last one together for you. Besides, I heard the Bentons would be coming round with the first of the late apples today.\u201d\n\u201cI appreciate that.\u201d\n\u201cNice and tight so they\u2019ll keep through the winter.\u201d Graham walked over and rapped a knuckle proudly against the side of the barrel. \u201cNothing like a winter apple to stave off hunger.\u201d He looked up with a glimmer in his eye and knocked at the side of the barrel again. \u201cGet it? Stave?\u201d\nKote groaned a bit, rubbing at his face.\nGraham chuckled to himself and ran a hand over one of the barrel\u2019s bright metal bands. \u201cI ain\u2019t ever made a barrel with brass before, but these turned out nice as I could hope for. You let me know if they don\u2019t stay tight. I\u2019ll see to \u2019em.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad it wasn\u2019t too much trouble,\u201d the innkeeper said. \u201cThe cellar gets damp. I worry iron would just rust out in a couple years.\u201d\nGraham nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right sensible,\u201d he said. \u201cNot many folk take the long view of things.\u201d He rubbed his hands together. \u201cWould you like to give me a hand? I\u2019d hate to drop one and scuff your floors.\u201d\nThey set to it. Two of the brass-bound barrels went to the basement while the third was maneuvered behind the bar, through the kitchen, and into the pantry.\nAfter that, the men made their way back to the common room, each on their own side of the bar. There was a moment of silence as Graham looked around the empty taproom. There were two fewer stools than there should be at the bar, and an empty space left by an absent table. In the orderly taproom these things were conspicuous as missing teeth.\nGraham pulled his eyes from a well-scrubbed piece of floor near the bar.", "He reached into his pocket and brought out a pair of dull iron shims, his hand hardly shaking at all. \u201cBring me up a short beer, would you, Kote?\u201d he asked, his voice rough. \u201cI know it\u2019s early, but I\u2019ve got a long day ahead of me. I\u2019m helping the Murrions bring their wheat in.\u201d\nThe innkeeper drew the beer and handed it over silently. Graham drank half of it off in a long swallow. His eyes were red around the edges. \u201cBad business last night,\u201d he said without making eye contact, then took another drink.\nKote nodded. Bad business last night. Chances are, that would be all Graham had to say about the death of a man he had known his whole life. These folk knew all about death. They killed their own livestock. They died from fevers, falls, or broken bones gone sour. Death was like an unpleasant neighbor. You didn\u2019t talk about him for fear he might hear you and decide to pay a visit.\nExcept for stories, of course. Tales of poisoned kings and duels and old wars were fine. They dressed death in foreign clothes and sent him far from your door. A chimney fire or the croup-cough were terrifying. But Gibea\u2019s trial or the siege of Enfast, those were different. They were like prayers, like charms muttered late at night when you were walking alone in the dark. Stories were like ha\u2019penny amulets you bought from a peddler, just in case.\n\u201cHow long is that scribe fellow going to be around?\u201d Graham asked after a moment, voice echoing in his mug. \u201cMaybe I should get a bit of something writ up, just in case.\u201d He frowned a bit. \u201cMy daddy always called them laying-down papers. Can\u2019t remember what they\u2019re really called.\u201d\n\u201cIf it\u2019s just your goods that need looking after, it\u2019s a disposition of property,\u201d the innkeeper said matter-of-factly. \u201cIf it relates to other things it\u2019s called a mandamus of declared will.\u201d\nGraham lifted an eyebrow at the innkeeper.\n\u201cWhat I heard at any rate,\u201d the innkeeper said, looking down and rubbing the bar with a clean white cloth. \u201cScribe mentioned something along those lines.\u201d\n\u201cMandamus . . .\u201d Graham murmured into his mug. \u201cI reckon I\u2019ll just ask him for some laying-down papers and let him official it up however he likes.\u201d He looked up at the innkeeper. \u201cOther folk will probably be wanting something similar, times being what they are.\u201d\nFor a moment it looked like the innkeeper frowned with irritation. But no, he did nothing of the sort. Standing behind the bar he looked the same as he", "always did, his expression placid and agreeable. He gave an easy nod. \u201cHe mentioned he\u2019d be setting up shop around midday,\u201d Kote said. \u201cHe was a bit unsettled by everything last night. If anyone shows up earlier than noon I expect they\u2019ll be disappointed.\u201d\nGraham shrugged. \u201cShouldn\u2019t make any difference. There won\u2019t be but ten people in the whole town until lunchtime anyway.\u201d He took another swallow of beer and looked out the window. \u201cToday\u2019s a field day and that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\nThe innkeeper seemed to relax a bit. \u201cHe\u2019ll be here tomorrow too. So there\u2019s no need for everyone to rush in today. Folk stole his horse off by Abbot\u2019s Ford, and he\u2019s trying to find a new one.\u201d\nGraham sucked his teeth sympathetically. \u201cPoor bastard. He won\u2019t find a horse for love nor money with harvest in mid-swing. Even Carter couldn\u2019t replace Nelly after that spider thing attacked him off by the Oldstone bridge.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem right, something like that happening not two miles from your own door. Back when\u2014\u201d\nGraham stopped. \u201cLord and lady, I sound like my old da.\u201d He tucked in his chin and added some gruff to his voice. \u201cBack when I was a boy we had proper weather. The miller kept his thumb off the scale and folk knew to look after their own business.\u201d\nThe innkeeper\u2019s face grew a wistful smile. \u201cMy father said the beer was better, and the roads had fewer ruts.\u201d\nGraham smiled, but it faded quickly. He looked down, as if uncomfortable with what he was about to say. \u201cI know you aren\u2019t from around here, Kote. That\u2019s a hard thing. Some folk think a stranger can\u2019t hardly know the time of day.\u201d\nHe drew a deep breath, still not meeting the inkeeper\u2019s eyes. \u201cBut I figure you know things other folk don\u2019t. You\u2019ve got sort of a wider view.\u201d He looked up, his eyes serious and weary, dark around the edges from lack of sleep. \u201cAre things as grim as they seem lately? The roads so bad. Folk getting robbed and . . .\u201d\nWith an obvious effort, Graham kept himself from looking at the empty piece of floor again. \u201cAll the new taxes making things so tight. The Grayden boys about to lose their farm. That spider thing.\u201d He took another swallow of beer. \u201cAre things as bad as they seem? Or have I just gotten old like my da, and now everything tastes a little bitter compared to when I was a boy?\u201d\nKote wiped at the bar for a long moment, as if reluctant to speak. \u201cI think things are usually bad one way or another,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might be that only us", "older folk can see it.\u201d\nGraham began to nod, then frowned. \u201cExcept you\u2019re not old, are you? I\nforget that most times.\u201d He looked the red-haired man up and down. \u201cI mean, you move around old, and you talk old, but you\u2019re not, are you? I\u2019ll bet you\u2019re half my age.\u201d He squinted at the innkeeper. \u201cHow old are you, anyway?\u201d\nThe innkeeper gave a tired smile. \u201cOld enough to feel old.\u201d\nGraham snorted. \u201cToo young to make old man noises. You should be out chasing women and getting into trouble. Leave us old folk to complain about how the world is getting all loose in the joints.\u201d\nThe old carpenter pushed himself away from the bar and turned to walk toward the door. \u201cI\u2019ll be back to talk to your scribe when we break for lunch today. I en\u2019t the only one, either. There\u2019s a lot of folks that\u2019ll want to get some things set down official when they\u2019ve got the chance.\u201d\nThe innkeeper drew a deep breath and let it out slowly. \u201cGraham?\u201d\nThe man turned with one hand on the door.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just you,\u201d Kote said. \u201cThings are bad, and my gut tells me they\u2019ll\nget worse yet. It wouldn\u2019t hurt a man to get ready for a hard winter. And maybe see that he can defend himself if need be.\u201d The innkeeper shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s what my gut tells me, anyway.\u201d\nGraham\u2019s mouth set into a grim line. He bobbed his head once in a serious nod. \u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s not just my gut, I suppose.\u201d\nThen he forced a grin and began to cuff up his shirt sleeves as he turned to the door. \u201cStill,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to make hay while the sun shines.\u201d\nNot long after that the Bentons stopped by with a cartload of late apples. The innkeeper bought half of what they had and spent the next hour sorting and storing them.\nThe greenest and firmest went into the barrels in the basement, his gentle hands laying them carefully in place and packing them in sawdust before hammering down the lids. Those closer to full ripe went to the pantry, and any with a bruise or spot of brown were doomed to be cider apples, quartered and tossed into a large tin washtub.\nAs he sorted and packed, the red-haired man seemed content. But if you\n \nlooked more closely you might have noticed that while his hands were busy, his eyes were far away. And while his expression was composed, pleasant even, there was no joy in it. He did not hum or whistle while he worked. He did not sing.\nWhen the last of the apples were sorted, he carried the metal tub through the kitchen and out the back door. It was a cool autumn morning, and behind the inn was a small, private garden sheltered by trees. Kote tumbled a load of quartered apples into the wooden cider press and spun the top down until it no longer moved easily.\nKote cuffed up the long sleeves of his shirt past his elbows, then gripped the handles of the press with his long, graceful hands and pulled. The press screwed down, first packing the apples tight, then crushing them. Twist and regrip. Twist and regrip.\nIf there had been anyone to see, they would have noticed his arms weren\u2019t the doughy arms of an innkeeper. When he pulled against the wooden handles, the muscles of his forearms stood out, tight as twisted ropes. Old scars crossed and recrossed his skin. Most were pale and thin as cracks in winter ice. Others were red and angry, standing out against his fair complexion.\nThe innkeeper\u2019s hands gripped and pulled, gripped and pulled. The only sounds were the rhythmic creak of the wood and the slow patter of the cider as it ran into the bucket below. There was a rhythm to it, but no music, and the innkeeper\u2019s eyes were distant and joyless, so pale a green they almost could have passed for grey.", ""], "CHAPTER TWO": ["CHAPTER TWO\nHolly\nCHRONICLER REACHED THE BOTTOM of the stairs and stepped into the Waystone\u2019s common room with his flat leather satchel over one shoulder. Stopping in the doorway, he eyed the red-haired innkeeper hunched intently over something on the bar.\nChronicler cleared his throat as he stepped into the room. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have slept so late,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not really . . .\u201d He stalled out when he saw what was on the bar. \u201cAre you making a pie?\u201d\nKote looked up from crimping the edge of the crust with his fingers. \u201cPies,\u201d he said, stressing the plural. \u201cYes. Why?\u201d\nChronicler opened his mouth, then closed it. His eyes flickered to the sword that hung, grey and silent behind the bar, then back to the red-haired man carefully pinching crust around the edge of a pan. \u201cWhat kind of pie?\u201d\n\u201cApple.\u201d Kote straightened and cut three careful slits into the crust covering the pie. \u201cDo you know how difficult it is to make a good pie?\u201d\n\u201cNot really,\u201d Chronicler admitted, then looked around nervously. \u201cWhere\u2019s your assistant?\u201d\n\u201cGod himself can only guess at such things,\u201d the innkeeper said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite hard. Making pies, I mean. You wouldn\u2019t think it, but there\u2019s quite a lot to the process. Bread is easy. Soup is easy. Pudding is easy. But pie is complicated. It\u2019s something you never realize until you try it for yourself.\u201d\nChronicler nodded in vague agreement, looking uncertain as to what else might be expected of him. He shrugged the satchel off his shoulder and set it on a nearby table.\nKote wiped his hands on his apron. \u201cWhen you press apples for cider, you know the pulp that\u2019s left over?\u201d\n\u201cThe pomace?\u201d\n\u201cPomace,\u201d Kote said with profound relief. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s called. What do people do with it, after they get the juice out?\u201d\n\u201cGrape pomace can make a weak wine,\u201d Chronicler said. \u201cOr oil, if you\u2019ve", "got a lot. But apple pomace is pretty useless. You can use it as fertilizer or mulch, but it\u2019s not much good as either. Folk feed it to their livestock mostly.\u201d\nKote nodded, looking thoughtful. \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem like they\u2019d just throw it out. They put everything to use one way or another around here. Pomace.\u201d He spoke as if he were tasting the word. \u201cThat\u2019s been bothering me for two years now.\u201d\nChronicler looked puzzled. \u201cAnyone in town could have told you that.\u201d\nThe innkeeper frowned. \u201cIf it\u2019s something everyone knows, I can\u2019t afford to ask,\u201d he said.\nThere was the sound of a door banging closed, followed by a bright, wandering whistle. Bast emerged from the kitchen carrying a bristling armload of holly boughs wrapped in a white sheet.\nKote nodded grimly and rubbed his hands together. \u201cLovely. Now how do we\u2014\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cAre those my good sheets?\u201d\nBast looked down at the bundle. \u201cWell Reshi,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cthat depends. Do you have any bad sheets?\u201d\nThe innkeeper\u2019s eyes flashed angrily for a second, then he sighed. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, I suppose.\u201d He reached over and pulled a single long branch from the bundle. \u201cWhat do we do with this, anyway?\u201d\nBast shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m running dark on this myself, Reshi. I know the Sithe used to ride out wearing holly crowns when they hunted the skin dancers. . . .\u201d\n\u201cWe can\u2019t walk around wearing holly crowns,\u201d Kote said dismissively. \u201cFolk would talk.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what the local plods think,\u201d Bast murmured as he began to weave several long, flexible branches together. \u201cWhen a dancer gets inside your body, you\u2019re like a puppet. They can make you bite out your own tongue.\u201d He lifted a half-formed circle up to his own head, checking the fit. He wrinkled his nose. \u201cPrickly.\u201d\n\u201cIn the stories I\u2019ve heard,\u201d Kote said, \u201cholly traps them in a body, too.\u201d\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t we just wear iron?\u201d Chronicler asked. The two men behind the bar looked at him curiously, as if they\u2019d almost forgotten he was there. \u201cI mean, if it\u2019s a faeling creature\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t say faeling,\u201d Bast said disparagingly. \u201cIt makes you sound like a child. It\u2019s a Fae creature. Faen, if you must.\u201d\nChronicler hesitated for a moment before continuing. \u201cIf this thing slid into", "the body of someone wearing iron, wouldn\u2019t that hurt it? Wouldn\u2019t it just jump out again?\u201d\n\u201cThey can make you bite. Out. Your own. Tongue,\u201d Bast repeated, as if speaking to a particularly stupid child. \u201cOnce they\u2019re in you, they\u2019ll use your hand to pull out your own eye as easy as you\u2019d pick a daisy. What makes you think they couldn\u2019t take the time to remove a bracelet or a ring?\u201d He shook his head, looking down as he worked another bright green branch of holly into the circle he held. \u201cBesides, I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m wearing iron.\u201d\n\u201cIf they can jump out of bodies,\u201d Chronicler said. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t it just leave that man\u2019s body last night? Why didn\u2019t it hop into one of us?\u201d\nThere was a long, quiet moment before Bast realized the other two men were looking at him. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me?\u201d He laughed incredulously. \u201cI have no idea. Anpauen. The last of the dancers were hunted down hundreds of years ago. Long before my time. I\u2019ve just heard stories.\u201d\n\u201cThen how do we know it didn\u2019t jump out?\u201d Chronicler said slowly, as if reluctant even to ask. \u201cHow do we know it isn\u2019t still here?\u201d He sat very stiffly in his seat. \u201cHow do we know it\u2019s not in one of us right now?\u201d\n\u201cIt seemed like it died when the mercenary\u2019s body died,\u201d Kote said. \u201cWe would have seen it leave.\u201d He glanced over at Bast. \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to look like a dark shadow or smoke when they leave the body, aren\u2019t they?\u201d\nBast nodded. \u201cPlus, if it had hopped out, it would have just started killing folk with the new body. That\u2019s what they usually do. They switch and switch until everyone is dead.\u201d\nThe innkeeper gave Chronicler a reassuring smile. \u201cSee? It might not even have been a dancer. Perhaps it was just something similar.\u201d\nChronicler looked a little wild around the eyes. \u201cBut how can we be sure? It might be inside anyone in town right now. . . .\u201d\n\u201cIt might be inside me,\u201d Bast said nonchalantly. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just waiting for you to let your guard down and then I\u2019ll bite you on the chest, right over your heart, and drink all the blood out of you. Like sucking the juice out of a plum.\u201d\nChronicler\u2019s mouth made a thin line. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny.\u201d\nBast looked up and gave Chronicler a rakish, toothy grin. But there was something slightly off about the expression. It lasted a little too long. The grin was slightly too wide. His eyes were focused slightly to one side of the scribe, rather than directly on him.\nBast went still for a moment, his fingers no longer weaving nimbly among", "the green leaves. He looked down at his hands curiously, then dropped the half-finished circle of holly onto the bar. His grin slowly faded to a blank expression, and he looked around the taproom dully. \u201cTe veyan?\u201d he said in a strange voice, his eyes glassy and confused. \u201cTe-tanten ventelanet?\u201d\nThen, moving with startling speed, Bast lunged from behind the bar toward Chronicler. The scribe exploded out of his seat, bolting madly away. He upset two tables and a half-dozen chairs before his feet got tangled and he tumbled messily to the floor, arms and legs flailing as he clawed his way frantically toward the door.\nAs he scrambled wildly, Chronicler darted a quick look over his shoulder, his face horrified and pale, only to see that Bast hadn\u2019t taken more than three steps. The dark-haired young man stood next to the bar, bent nearly double and shaking with helpless laughter. One hand half-covered his face, while the other pointed at Chronicler. He was laughing so hard he could barely draw a breath. After a moment he had to reach out and steady himself against the bar.\nChronicler was livid. \u201cYou ass!\u201d he shouted as he climbed painfully to his feet. \u201cYou . . . you ass!\u201d\nStill laughing too hard to breathe, Bast raised his hands and made weak, halfhearted clawing gestures, like a child pretending to be a bear.\n\u201cBast,\u201d the innkeeper chided. \u201cCome now. Really.\u201d But while Kote\u2019s voice was stern, his eyes were bright with laughter. His lips twitched, struggling not to curl.\nMoving with affronted dignity, Chronicler busied himself setting the tables and chairs to rights, thumping them down rather harder than he needed to. When at last he returned to his original table, he sat down stiffly. By then Bast had returned to stand behind the bar, breathing hard and pointedly focusing on the holly in his hands.\nChronicler glared at him and rubbed his shin. Bast stifled something that could, conceivably, have been a cough.\nKote chuckled low in his throat and pulled another length of holly from the bundle, adding it to the long cord he was making. He looked up to catch Chronicler\u2019s eye. \u201cBefore I forget to mention it, folk will be stopping by today to take advantage of your services as a scribe.\u201d\nChronicler seemed surprised. \u201cWill they now?\u201d\nKote nodded and gave an irritated sigh. \u201cYes. The news is already out, so it can\u2019t be helped. We\u2019ll have to deal with them as they come. Luckily,", "everyone with two good hands will be busy in the fields until midday, so we won\u2019t have to worry about it until\u2014\u201d\nThe innkeeper\u2019s fingers fumbled clumsily, snapping the holly branch and jabbing a thorn deep into the fleshy part of his thumb. The red-haired man didn\u2019t flinch or curse, just scowled angrily down at his hand as a bead of blood welled up, bright as a berry.\nFrowning, the innkeeper brought his thumb to his mouth. All the laughter faded from his expression, and his eyes were hard and dark. He tossed the half-finished holly cord aside in a gesture so pointedly casual it was almost frightening.\nHe looked back to Chronicler, his voice perfectly calm. \u201cMy point is that we should make good use of our time before we\u2019re interrupted,\u201d he said. \u201cBut first, I imagine you\u2019ll want some breakfast.\u201d\n\u201cIf it wouldn\u2019t be too much trouble,\u201d Chronicler said.\n\u201cNone at all,\u201d Kote said as he turned and headed into the kitchen.\nBast watched him leave, a concerned expression on his face. \u201cYou\u2019ll want\nto pull the cider off the stove and set it to cool out back.\u201d Bast called out to him loudly. \u201cThe last batch was closer to jam than juice. And I found some herbs while I was out, too. They\u2019re on the rain barrel. You should look them over to see if they\u2019ll be of any use for supper.\u201d\nLeft alone in the taproom, Bast and Chronicler watched each other across the bar for a long moment. The only sound was the distant thump of the back door closing.\nBast made a final adjustment to the crown in his hands, looking it over from all angles. He brought it up to his face as if to smell it. But instead he drew a deep lungful of air, closed his eyes, and breathed out against the holly leaves so gently they barely moved.\nOpening his eyes, Bast gave a charming, apologetic smile and walked over to Chronicler. \u201cHere.\u201d He held out the circle of holly to the seated man.\nChronicler made no move to take it.\nBast\u2019s smile didn\u2019t fade. \u201cYou didn\u2019t notice because you were busy falling down,\u201d he said, his voice pitched low and quiet. \u201cBut he actually laughed when you bolted. Three good laughs from down in his belly. He has such a wonderful laugh. It\u2019s like fruit. Like music. I haven\u2019t heard it in months.\u201d\nBast held the circle of holly out again, smiling shyly. \u201cSo this is for you. I\u2019ve brought what grammarie I have to bear on it. So it will stay green and living longer than you\u2019d think. I gathered the holly in the proper way and", "shaped it with my own hands. Sought, wrought, and moved to purpose.\u201d He held it out a bit farther, like a nervous boy with a bouquet. \u201cHere. It is a freely given gift. I offer it without obligation, let, or lien.\u201d\nHesitantly, Chronicler reached out and took the crown. He looked it over, turning it in his hands. Red berries nestled in the dark green leaves like gems, and it was cunningly braided so the thorns angled outward. He set it gingerly on his head, and it fit snugly across his brow.\nBast grinned. \u201cAll hail the Lord of Misrule!\u201d he shouted, throwing up his hands. He laughed a delighted laugh.\nA smile tugged Chronicler\u2019s lips as he removed the crown. \u201cSo,\u201d he said softly as he lowered his hands into his lap. \u201cDoes this mean things are settled between us?\u201d\nBast tilted his head, puzzled. \u201cBeg pardon?\u201d\nChronicler looked uncomfortable. \u201cWhat you spoke of... last night . . .\u201d Bast looked surprised. \u201cOh no,\u201d he said seriously, shaking his head. \u201cNo.\nNot at all. You belong to me, down to the marrow of your bones. You are an instrument of my desire.\u201d Bast darted a glance toward the kitchen, his expression turning bitter. \u201cAnd you know what I desire. Make him remember he\u2019s more than some innkeeper baking pies.\u201d He practically spat the last word.\nChronicler shifted uneasily in his seat, looking away. \u201cI still don\u2019t know what I can do.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll do whatever you can,\u201d Bast said, his voice low. \u201cYou will draw him out of himself. You will wake him up.\u201d He said the last words fiercely.\nBast lay one hand on Chronicler\u2019s shoulder, his blue eyes narrowing ever so slightly. \u201cYou will make him remember. You will.\u201d\nChronicler hesitated for a moment, then looked down at the circle of holly in his lap and gave a small nod. \u201cI\u2019ll do what I can.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all any of us can do,\u201d Bast said, giving him a friendly pat on the back. \u201cHow\u2019s the shoulder, by the way?\u201d\nThe scribe rolled it around, the motion seeming out of place as the rest of his body remained stiff and still. \u201cNumb. Chilly. But it doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s to be expected. I wouldn\u2019t worry about it if I were you.\u201d Bast smiled at him encouragingly. \u201cLife\u2019s too short for you folk to fret over little things.\u201d\n \nBreakfast came and went. Potatoes, toast, tomatoes, and eggs. Chronicler tucked away a respectable portion and Bast ate enough for three people. Kote puttered about, bringing in more firewood, stoking the oven in preparation for the pies, and jugging up the cooling cider.\nHe was carrying a pair of jugs to the bar when boots sounded on the wooden landing outside the inn, loud as any knocking. A moment later the smith\u2019s prentice burst through the door. Barely sixteen, he was one of the tallest men in town, with broad shoulders and thick arms.\n\u201cHello Aaron,\u201d the innkeeper said calmly. \u201cClose the door, would you? It\u2019s dusty out.\u201d\nAs the smith\u2019s prentice turned back to the door, the innkeeper and Bast tucked most of the holly below the bar, moving in quick, unspoken concert. By the time the smith\u2019s prentice turned back to face them, Bast was toying with something that could easily have been a small, half-finished wreath. Something made to keep idle fingers busy against boredom.\nAaron didn\u2019t seem to notice anything different as he hurried up to the bar. \u201cMr. Kote,\u201d he said excitedly, \u201ccould I get some traveling food?\u201d He waved an empty burlap sack. \u201cCarter said you\u2019d know what that meant.\u201d\nThe innkeeper nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve got some bread and cheese, sausage and apples.\u201d He gestured to Bast, who grabbed the sack and scampered off into the kitchen. \u201cCarter\u2019s going somewhere today?\u201d\n\u201cHim and me both,\u201d the boy said. \u201cThe Orrisons are selling some mutton off in Treya today. They hired me and Carter to come along, on account of the roads being so bad and all.\u201d\n\u201cTreya,\u201d the innkeeper mused. \u201cYou won\u2019t be back \u2019til tomorrow then.\u201d\nThe smith\u2019s prentice carefully set a slim silver bit on the polished mahogany of the bar. \u201cCarter\u2019s hoping to find a replacement for Nelly, too. But if he can\u2019t come by a horse he said he\u2019ll probably take the king\u2019s coin.\u201d\nKote\u2019s eyebrows went up. \u201cCarter\u2019s going to enlist?\u201d\nThe boy gave a smile that was a strange mix of grin and grim. \u201cHe says there ain\u2019t much else for him if he can\u2019t come by a horse for his cart. He says they take care of you in the army, you get fed and get to travel around and such.\u201d The young man\u2019s eyes were excited as he spoke, his expression trapped somewhere between a boy\u2019s enthusiasm and the serious worry of a man. \u201cAnd they ain\u2019t just giving folks a silver noble for listing up anymore.", "These days they hand you over a royal when you sign up. A whole gold royal.\u201d\nThe innkeeper\u2019s expression grew somber. \u201cCarter\u2019s the only one thinking about taking the coin, right?\u201d He looked the boy in the eye.\n\u201cRoyal\u2019s a lot of money,\u201d the smith\u2019s prentice admitted, flashing a sly grin. \u201cAnd times are tight since my da passed on and my mum moved over from Rannish.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what does your mother think of you taking the king\u2019s coin?\u201d\nThe boy\u2019s face fell. \u201cNow don\u2019t go takin\u2019 her side,\u201d he complained. \u201cI thought you\u2019d understand. You\u2019re a man, you know how a fellow has to do right by his mum.\u201d\n\u201cI know your mum would rather have you home safe than swim in a tub of gold, boy.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of folk calling me \u2018boy,\u2019\u201d the smith\u2019s prentice snapped, his face flushing. \u201cI can do some good in the army. Once we get the rebels to swear fealty to the Penitent King, things will start getting better again. The levy taxes will stop. The Bentleys won\u2019t lose their land. The roads will be safe again.\u201d\nThen his expression went grim, and for a second his face didn\u2019t seem very young at all. \u201cAnd then my mum won\u2019t have to sit all anxious when I\u2019m not at home,\u201d he said, his voice dark. \u201cShe\u2019ll stop waking up three times a night, checking the window shutters and the bar on the door.\u201d\nAaron met the innkeeper\u2019s eye, and his back straightened. When he stopped slouching, he was almost a full head taller than the innkeeper. \u201cSometimes a man has to stand up for his king and his country.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Rose?\u201d the innkeeper asked quietly.\nThe prentice blushed and looked down in embarrassment. His shoulders slouched again and he deflated, like a sail when the wind goes out of it. \u201cLord, does everyone know about us?\u201d\nThe innkeeper nodded with a gentle smile. \u201cNo secrets in a town like this.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Aaron said resolutely, \u201cI\u2019m doing this for her too. For us. With my coin and the pay I\u2019ve saved, I can buy us a house, or set up my own shop without having to go to some shim moneylender.\u201d\nKote opened his mouth, then closed it again. He looked thoughtful for the space of a long, deep breath, then spoke as if choosing his words very carefully. \u201cAaron, do you know who Kvothe is?\u201d\nThe smith\u2019s prentice rolled his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not an idiot. We were telling", "stories about him just last night, remember?\u201d He looked over the innkeeper\u2019s shoulder toward the kitchen. \u201cLook, I\u2019ve got to get on my way. Carter\u2019ll be mad as a wet hen if I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\nKote made a calming gesture. \u201cI\u2019ll make you a deal, Aaron. Listen to what I have to say, and I\u2019ll let you have your food for free.\u201d He pushed the silver bit back across the bar. \u201cThen you can use that to buy something nice for Rose in Treya.\u201d\nAaron nodded cautiously. \u201cFair enough.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you know about Kvothe from the stories you\u2019ve heard? What\u2019s he supposed to be like?\u201d\nAaron laughed. \u201cAside from dead?\u201d\nKote smiled faintly. \u201cAside from dead.\u201d\n\u201cHe knew all sorts of secret magics,\u201d Aaron said. \u201cHe knew six words he\ncould whisper in a horse\u2019s ear that would make it run a hundred miles. He could turn iron into gold and catch lightning in a quart jar to save it for later. He knew a song that would open any lock, and he could stave in a strong oak door with just one hand. . . .\u201d\nAaron trailed off. \u201cIt all depends on the story, really. Sometimes he\u2019s the good guy, like Prince Gallant. He rescued some girls from a troupe of ogres once....\u201d\nAnother faint smile. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201c. . . but in other stories he\u2019s a right bastard,\u201d Aaron continued. \u201cHe stole secret magics from the University. That\u2019s why they threw him out, you know. And they didn\u2019t call him Kvothe Kingkiller because he was good with a lute.\u201d\nThe smile was gone, but the innkeeper nodded. \u201cTrue enough. But what was he like?\u201d\nAaron\u2019s brow furrowed a bit. \u201cHe had red hair, if that\u2019s what you mean. All the stories say that. A right devil with a sword. He was terrible clever. Had a real silver tongue, too, could talk his way out of anything.\u201d\nThe innkeeper nodded. \u201cRight. So if you were Kvothe, and terrible clever, as you say. And suddenly your head was worth a thousand royals and a duchy to whoever cut it off, what would you do?\u201d\nThe smith\u2019s prentice shook his head and shrugged, plainly at a loss.\n\u201cWell if I were Kvothe,\u201d the innkeeper said, \u201cI\u2019d fake my death, change my name, and find some little town out in the middle of nowhere. Then I\u2019d open an inn and do my best to disappear.\u201d He looked at the young man.", "\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019d do.\u201d\nAaron\u2019s eye flickered to the innkeeper\u2019s red hair, to the sword that hung\nover the bar, then back to the innkeeper\u2019s eyes.\nKote nodded slowly, then pointed to Chronicler. \u201cThat fellow isn\u2019t just\nsome ordinary scribe. He\u2019s a sort of historian, here to write down the true story of my life. You\u2019ve missed the beginning, but if you\u2019d like, you can stay for the rest.\u201d He smiled an easy smile. \u201cI can tell you stories no one has ever heard before. Stories no one will ever hear again. Stories about Felurian, how I learned to fight from the Adem. The truth about Princess Ariel.\u201d\nThe innkeeper reached across the bar and touched the boy\u2019s arm. \u201cTruth is, Aaron, I\u2019m fond of you. I think you\u2019re uncommon smart, and I\u2019d hate to see you throw your life away.\u201d He took a deep breath and looked the smith\u2019s prentice full in the face. His eyes were a startling green. \u201cI know how this war started. I know the truth of it. Once you hear that, you won\u2019t be nearly so eager to run off and die fighting in the middle of it.\u201d\nThe innkeeper gestured to one of the empty chairs at the table beside Chronicler and smiled a smile so charming and easy that it belonged on a storybook prince. \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d\nAaron stared seriously at the innkeeper for a long moment, his eyes darting up to the sword, then back down again. \u201cIf you really are . . .\u201d His voice trailed off, but his expression turned it into a question.\n\u201cI really am,\u201d Kote reassured him gently.\n\u201c. . . then can I see your cloak of no particular color?\u201d the prentice asked with a grin.\nThe innkeeper\u2019s charming smile went stiff and brittle as a sheet of shattered glass.\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting Kvothe confused with Taborlin the Great,\u201d Chronicler said matter-of-factly from across the room. \u201cTaborlin had the cloak of no particular color.\u201d\nAaron\u2019s expression was puzzled as he turned to look at the scribe. \u201cWhat did Kvothe have, then?\u201d\n\u201cA shadow cloak,\u201d Chronicler said. \u201cIf I remember correctly.\u201d\nThe boy turned back toward the bar. \u201cCan you show me your shadow cloak then?\u201d he asked. \u201cOr a bit of magic? I\u2019ve always wanted to see some. Just a little fire or lightning would be enough. I wouldn\u2019t want to tire you out.\u201d\nBefore the innkeeper could to respond, Aaron burst into a sudden laugh.", "\u201cI\u2019m just havin\u2019 some fun with you, Mr. Kote.\u201d He grinned again, wider than before. \u201cLord and lady, but I ain\u2019t never heard a liar like you before in my whole life. Even my Uncle Alvan couldn\u2019t tell one like that with a straight face.\u201d\nThe innkeeper looked down and muttered something incomprehensible.\nAaron reached over the bar and lay a broad hand on Kote\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI know you\u2019re just trying to help, Mr. Kote,\u201d he said warmly. \u201cYou\u2019re a good man, and I\u2019ll think about what you said. I\u2019m not rushing out to join. I just want to give my options a look-over.\u201d\nThe smith\u2019s prentice shook his head ruefully. \u201cI swear. Everyone\u2019s taken a run at me this morning. My mum said she was sick with the consumption. Rose told me she was pregnant.\u201d He ran one hand through his hair, chuckling. \u201cBut yours was the ribbon-winner of the lot, I\u2019ve gotta say.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you know . . .\u201d Kote managed a sickly smile. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have looked your mum square in the eye if I hadn\u2019t given it a shot.\u201d\n\u201cYou might have had a chance if you\u2019d picked something easier to swallow,\u201d he said. \u201cBut everybody knows Kvothe\u2019s sword was made of silver.\u201d He flicked his eyes up to the sword that hung on the wall. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t called Folly, either. It was Kaysera, the poet-killer.\u201d\nThe innkeeper rocked back a bit at that. \u201cThe poet-killer?\u201d\nAaron nodded doggedly. \u201cYes sir. And your scribe there is right. He had his cloak made all out of cobwebs and shadows, and he wore rings on all his fingers. How does it go?\nOn his first hand he wore rings of stone, Iron, amber, wood, and bone.\nThere were\u2014\nThe smith\u2019s prentice frowned. \u201cI can\u2019t remember the rest. There was something about fire. . . .\u201d\nThe innkeeper\u2019s expression was unreadable. He looked down at where his own hands lay spread on the top of the bar, and after a moment he recited:\nThere were rings unseen on his second hand. One was blood in a flowing band.\nOne of air all whisper thin,\nAnd the ring of ice had a flaw within.", "Full faintly shone the ring of flame, And the final ring was without name.\n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Aaron said, smiling. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any of those behind the bar, do you?\u201d He stood on his toes as if trying to get a better look.\nKote gave a shaky, shamefaced smile. \u201cNo. No, I can\u2019t say as I do.\u201d\nThey both startled as Bast thumped a burlap sack onto the bar. \u201cThat should take care of both Carter and you for two days with plenty to spare,\u201d Bast said brusquely.\nAaron shouldered the sack and started to leave, then hesitated and looked back at the two of them behind the bar. \u201cI hate to ask for favors. Old Cob said he\u2019d look in on my mum for me, but . . .\u201d\nBast made his way around the bar and began herding Aaron toward the door. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine, I expect. I\u2019ll stop and see Rose too, if you like.\u201d He gave the smith\u2019s prentice a wide, lascivious smile. \u201cJust to make sure she\u2019s not lonely or anything.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d appreciate it,\u201d Aaron said, relief plain in his voice. \u201cShe was in a bit of a state when I left. She could do with some comforting.\u201d\nBast stopped midway through opening the inn\u2019s door and gave the broad- shouldered boy a look of utter disbelief. Then he shook his head and finished opening the door. \u201cRight, off you go. Have fun in the big city. Don\u2019t drink the water.\u201d\nBast closed the door and pressed his forehead against the wood as if suddenly weary. \u201cShe could use some comforting?\u201d he repeated incredulously. \u201cI take back everything I ever said about that boy being clever.\u201d He turned around to face the bar while leveling an accusatory finger at the closed door. \u201cThat,\u201d he said firmly to the room in general, \u201cis what comes of working with iron every day.\u201d\nThe innkeeper gave a humorless chuckle as he leaned against the bar. \u201cSo much for my legendary silver tongue.\u201d\nBast gave a derogatory snort. \u201cThe boy is an idiot, Reshi.\u201d\n\u201cAm I supposed to feel better because I wasn\u2019t able to persuade an idiot, Bast?\u201d\nChronicler cleared his throat softly. \u201cIt seems more of a testament to the performance you\u2019ve given here,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve played the innkeeper so well they can\u2019t think of you any other way.\u201d He gestured around at the empty taproom. \u201cFrankly, I\u2019m surprised you\u2019d be willing to risk your life here just", "to keep the boy out of the army.\u201d\n\u201cNot much of a risk,\u201d the innkeeper said. \u201cIt\u2019s not much of a life.\u201d He\nhauled himself upright and walked around to the front of the bar, making his way to the table where Chronicler sat. \u201cI\u2019m responsible for everyone who dies in this stupid war. I was just hoping to save one. Apparently even that is beyond me.\u201d\nHe sank into the chair opposite Chronicler. \u201cWhere did we leave off yesterday ? No sense repeating myself if I can help it.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d just called the wind and given Ambrose a piece of what he had coming to him,\u201d Bast said from where he stood at the door. \u201cAnd you were mooning over your ladylove something fierce.\u201d\nKote looked up. \u201cI do not moon, Bast.\u201d\nChronicler picked up his flat leather satchel and produced a sheet of paper three-quarters full of small, precise writing. \u201cI can read the last bit back to you, if you\u2019d like.\u201d\nKote held out his hand. \u201cI can remember your cipher well enough to read it for myself,\u201d he said wearily. \u201cGive it over. Maybe it will prime the pump.\u201d He glanced over at Bast. \u201cCome and sit if you\u2019re going to listen. I won\u2019t have you hovering.\u201d\nBast scampered for a seat while Kote drew a deep breath and looked over the last page of yesterday\u2019s story. The innkeeper was quiet for a long moment. His mouth made something that might have been the beginning of a frown, then something like a faint shadow of a smile.\nHe nodded thoughtfully, his eyes still on the page. \u201cSo much of my young life was spent trying to get to the University,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to go there even before my troupe was killed. Before I knew the Chandrian were more than a campfire story. Before I began searching for the Amyr.\u201d\nThe innkeeper leaned back in his chair, his weary expression fading, becoming thoughtful instead. \u201cI thought once I was there, things would be easy. I would learn magic and find the answers to all my questions. I thought it would all be storybook simple.\u201d\nKvothe gave a slightly embarrassed smile, the expression making his face look surprisingly young. \u201cAnd it might have been, if I didn\u2019t have a talent for making enemies and borrowing trouble. All I wanted was to play my music, attend my classes, and find my answers. Everything I wanted was at the University. All I wanted was to stay.\u201d He nodded to himself. \u201cThat\u2019s where we should begin.\u201d", "The innkeeper handed the sheet of paper back to Chronicler, who absentmindedly smoothed it down with one hand. Chronicler uncapped his ink and dipped his pen. Bast leaned forward eagerly, grinning like an excited child.\nKvothe\u2019s bright eyes flickered around the room, taking everything in. He drew a deep breath, and flashed a sudden smile, and for a brief moment looked nothing like an innkeeper at all. His eyes were sharp and bright, green as a blade of grass. \u201cReady?\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER THREE": ["CHAPTER THREE\nLuck\nEVERY TERM AT THE University began the same way: the admissions lottery followed by a full span of interviews. They were a necessary evil of sorts.\nI don\u2019t doubt the process started sensibly. Back when the University was smaller, I could picture them as actual interviews. An opportunity for a student to have a conversation with the masters about what he had learned. A dialogue. A discussion.\nBut these days the University was host to over a thousand students. There was no time for discussion. Instead, each student was subjected to a hail of questions in a handful of minutes. Brief as the interviews were, a single wrong answer or overlong hesitation could have a dramatic impact on your tuition.\nBefore interviews, students studied obsessively. Afterward, they drank in celebration or to console themselves. Because of this, for the eleven days of admissions, most students looked anxious and exhausted at best. At worst they wandered the University like shamble-men, hollow-eyed and grey-faced from too little sleep, too much drink, or both.\nPersonally, I found it odd how seriously everyone else took the whole process. The vast majority of students were nobility or members of wealthy merchant families. For them, a high tuition was an inconvenience, leaving them less pocket money to spend on horses and whores.\nThe stakes were higher for me. Once the masters set a tuition, it couldn\u2019t be changed. So if my tuition was set too high, I\u2019d be barred from the University until I could pay.\nThe first day of admissions always had a festival air about it. The admissions\n \nlottery took up the first half of the day, which meant the unlucky students who drew the earliest slots were forced to go through their interviews mere hours afterward.\nBy the time I arrived long lines snaked through the courtyard, while the students who had already drawn their tiles milled about, complaining and attempting to buy, sell, or trade their slots.\nI didn\u2019t see Wilem or Simmon anywhere, so I settled into the nearest line and tried not to think of how little I had in my purse: one talent and three jots. At one point in my life, it would have seemed like all the money in the world. But for tuition it was nowhere near enough.\nThere were carts scattered about selling sausages and chestnuts, hot cider and beer. I smelled warm bread and grease from a nearby cart. It was stacked with pork pies for the sort of people who could afford such things.\nThe lottery was always held in the largest courtyard of the University. Most everyone called it the pennant square, though a few folk with longer memories referred to it as the Questioning Hall. I knew it by an even older name, the House of the Wind.\nI watched a few leaves tumble around the cobblestones, and when I looked up I saw Fela staring back at me from where she stood thirty or forty people closer to the front of the line. She gave me a warm smile and a wave. I waved back and she left her place, strolling back to where I stood.\nFela was beautiful. The sort of woman you would expect to see in a painting. Not the elaborate, artificial beauty you often see among the nobility, Fela was natural and unselfconscious, with wide eyes and a full mouth that was constantly smiling. Here in the University, where men outnumbered women ten to one, she stood out like a horse in a sheepfold.\n\u201cDo you mind if I wait with you?\u201d she asked as she came to stand beside me. \u201cI hate not having anyone to talk to.\u201d She smiled winsomely at the pair of men queued up behind me. \u201cI\u2019m not cutting in,\u201d she explained. \u201cI\u2019m just moving back.\u201d\nThey had no objections, though their eyes flickered back and forth between Fela and myself. I could almost hear them wondering why one of the most lovely women in the University would give up her place in line to stand next to me.\nIt was a fair question. I was curious myself.\nI moved aside to make space for her. We stood shoulder to shoulder for a moment, neither of us speaking.", "\u201cWhat are you studying this term?\u201d I asked.\nFela brushed her hair back from her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll keep up with my work in the Archives, I suppose. Some chemistry. And Brandeur has invited me into Manifold Maths.\u201d\nI shivered a bit. \u201cToo many numbers. I can\u2019t swim those waters.\u201d\nFela gave a shrug and the long, dark curls of hair she\u2019d brushed away took the opportunity to tumble back, framing her face. \u201cIt\u2019s not so hard once you get your head around it. It\u2019s more like a game than anything.\u201d She cocked her head at me. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d\n\u201cObservation in the Medica,\u201d I said. \u201cStudy and work in the Fishery. Sympathy too, if Dal will have me. I should probably brush up my Siaru too.\u201d\n\u201cYou speak Siaru?\u201d she asked, sounding surprised.\n\u201cI can get by,\u201d I said. \u201cBut Wil says my grammar is embarrassingly bad.\u201d Fela nodded, then looked sideways at me, biting her lip. \u201cElodin\u2019s asked\nme to join his class, too,\u201d she said, her voice thick with apprehension. \u201cElodin\u2019s got a class?\u201d I asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t think they let him teach.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s starting it this term,\u201d she said, giving me a curious look. \u201cI thought\nyou\u2019d be in it. Didn\u2019t he sponsor you to Re\u2019lar?\u201d\n\u201cHe did,\u201d I said.\n\u201cOh.\u201d She looked uncomfortable, then quickly added, \u201cHe probably just\nhasn\u2019t asked you yet. Or he\u2019s planning on mentoring you separately.\u201d\nI waved her comment aside, though I was stung at the thought of being left\nout. \u201cWho can say with Elodin?\u201d I said. \u201cIf he isn\u2019t crazy, he\u2019s the best actor I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\nFela started to say something, then looked around nervously and moved closer to me. Her shoulder brushed mine and her curling hair tickled my ear as she quietly asked, \u201cDid he really throw you off the roof of the Crockery?\u201d\nI gave an embarrassed chuckle. \u201cThat\u2019s a complicated story,\u201d I said, then changed the subject rather clumsily. \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of his class?\u201d\nShe rubbed her forehead and gave a frustrated laugh. \u201cI haven\u2019t the slightest idea. He said the name of the class was the name of the class.\u201d She looked at me. \u201cWhat does that mean? When I go to Ledgers and Lists will it be there under \u2018The Name of the Class?\u2019\u201d\nI admitted I didn\u2019t know, and from there it was a short step to sharing Elodin stories. Fela said a scriv had caught him naked in the Archives. I\u2019d heard that he\u2019d once spent an entire span walking around the University blindfolded. Fela heard he\u2019d invented an entire language from the ground up.", "I\u2019d heard he had started a fistfight in one of the seedier local taverns because someone had insisted on saying the word \u201cutilize\u201d instead of \u201cuse.\u201d\n\u201cI heard that too,\u201d Fela said, laughing. \u201cExcept it was at the Horse and Four, and it was a baronet who wouldn\u2019t stop using the word \u2018moreover.\u2019 \u201d\nBefore I knew it we were at the front of the line. \u201cKvothe, Arliden\u2019s son,\u201d I said. The bored-looking woman marked my name and I drew a smooth ivory tile out of the black velvet bag. It read: FELLING\u2014NOON. Eighth day of admissions, plenty of time to prepare.\nFela drew her own tile and we moved away from the table.\n\u201cWhat did you get?\u201d I asked.\nShe showed me her own small ivory tile. Cendling at fourth bell.\nIt was an incredibly lucky draw, one of the latest slots available. \u201cWow.\nCongratulations.\u201d\nFela shrugged and slipped the tile into her pocket. \u201cIt\u2019s all the same to me.\nI don\u2019t make a special point of studying. The more I prepare, the worse I do. It just makes me nervous.\u201d\n\u201cYou should trade it away then.\u201d I said, gesturing to the milling throng of students. \u201cSomeone would pay a full talent to get that slot. Maybe more.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not much for bargaining, either,\u201d she said. \u201cI just assume whatever tile I draw is lucky and stick to it.\u201d\nFree from the line, we didn\u2019t have any excuse to stay together. But I was enjoying her company and she didn\u2019t seem terribly eager to run off, so the two of us wandered the courtyard aimlessly, the crowd milling around us.\n\u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d Fela said suddenly. \u201cDo you want to go have an early lunch somewhere?\u201d\nI was painfully aware of how light my purse was. If I were any poorer, I\u2019d have to put a rock in it to keep it from flapping in the breeze. My meals were free at Anker\u2019s because I played music there. So spending money on food somewhere else, especially so close to admissions, would be absolute foolishness.\n\u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d I said honestly. Then I lied. \u201cBut I should browse around here a bit and see if anyone is willing to trade slots with me. I\u2019m a bargainer from way back.\u201d\nFela fished around in her pocket. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for more time, you can have mine.\u201d\nI looked at the tile between her finger and thumb, sorely tempted. Two extra more days of preparation would be a godsend. Or I could make a talent", "by trading it away. Maybe two.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to take your luck,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cAnd you certainly\ndon\u2019t want any part of mine. Besides, you\u2019ve already been too generous with me.\u201d I drew my cloak around my shoulders pointedly.\nFela smiled at that, reaching out to run her knuckles across the front of the cloak. \u201cI\u2019m glad you like it. But as far as I\u2019m concerned, I still owe you.\u201d She bit at her lips nervously, then let her hand drop. \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll let me know if you change your mind.\u201d\n\u201cI promise.\u201d\nShe smiled again, then gave a half-wave and walked off across the courtyard. Watching her stroll through the crowd was like watching the wind move across the surface of a pond. Except instead of casting ripples on the water, the heads of young men turned to watch her as she passed.\nI was still watching when Wilem walked up beside me. \u201cAre you finished with your flirting then?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t flirting,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou should have been,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is the point of me waiting politely, not interrupting, if you waste such opportunities?\u201d\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t like that,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019s just friendly.\u201d\n\u201cObviously,\u201d he said, his rough Cealdish accent making the sarcasm in his voice seem twice as thick. \u201cWhat did you draw?\u201d\nI showed him my tile.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a day later than me.\u201d He held out his tile. \u201cI\u2019ll trade you for a jot.\u201d I hesitated.\n\u201cCome now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if you can study in the Archives like the rest of us.\u201d\nI glared at him. \u201cYour empathy is overwhelming.\u201d\n\u201cI save my empathy for those clever enough to avoid driving the Master Archivist into a frothing rage,\u201d he said. \u201cFor folk such as you, I only have a jot in trade. Would you like it, or not?\u201d\n\u201cI would like two jots,\u201d I said, scanning the crowd, looking for students with a desperate wildness around their eyes. \u201cIf I can get them.\u201d\nWilem narrowed his dark eyes. \u201cA jot and three drabs,\u201d he said.\nI looked back at him, eyeing him carefully. \u201cA jot and three,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd you take Simmon as your partner the next time we play corners.\u201d\nHe gave a huff of laughter and nodded. We traded tiles and I tucked the money into my purse: one talent and four. A small step closer. After a", "moment\u2019s thought, I tucked my tile into my pocket.\n\u201cAren\u2019t you going to keep trading down?\u201dWil asked.\nI shook my head. \u201cI think I\u2019ll keep this slot.\u201d\nHe frowned. \u201cWhy? What can you do with four days except fret and\nthumb-twiddle?\u201d\n\u201cSame as anyone,\u201d I said. \u201cPrepare for my admissions interview.\u201d \u201cHow?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou are still banned from the Archives, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cThere are other types of preparation,\u201d I said mysteriously.\nWilem snorted. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound suspicious at all,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you\nwonder why people talk about you.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t wonder why they talk,\u201d I said. \u201cI wonder what they say.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER FOUR": ["CHAPTER FOUR\nTar and Tin\nTHE CITY THAT HAD grown up around the University over the centuries was not large. It was barely more than a town, really.\nDespite this, trade thrived at our end of the Great Stone Road. Merchants brought in carts of raw materials: tar and clay, gibbstone, potash, and sea salt. They brought luxuries like Lanetti coffee and Vintish wine. They brought fine dark ink from Arueh, pure white sand for our glassworks, and delicately crafted Cealdish springs and screws.\nWhen those same merchants left, their wagons were laden with things you could only find at the University. The Medica made medicines. Real medicines, not colored stumpwater or penny nostrums. The alchemy complex produced its own marvels that I was only dimly aware of, as well as raw materials like naphtha, sulfurjack, and twicelime.\nI might be biased, but I think it\u2019s fair to say that most of the University\u2019s tangible wonders came from the Artificery. Ground glass lenses. Ingots of wolfram and Glantz steel. Sheets of gold so thin they tore like tissue paper.\nBut we made much more than that. Sympathy lamps and telescopes. Heateaters and gearwins. Salt pumps. Trifoil compasses. A dozen versions of Teccam\u2019s winch and Delevari\u2019s axle.\nArtificers like myself made these things, and when merchants bought them we earned a commission: sixty percent of the sale. This was the only reason I had any money at all. And, since there were no classes during admissions, I had a full span of days to work in the Fishery.\nI made my way to the Stocks, the storeroom where artificers signed out tools and materials. I was surprised to see a tall, pale student standing at the window, looking profoundly bored.\n \n\u201cJaxim?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat are you doing here? This is a scrub job.\u201d\nJaxim nodded morosely. \u201cKilvin is still a little . . . vexed with me,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know. The fire and everything.\u201d\n\u201cSorry to hear it,\u201d I said. Jaxim was a full Re\u2019lar like myself. He could be pursuing any number of projects on his own right now. To be forced into a menial task like this wasn\u2019t just boring, it humiliated Jaxim publicly while costing him money and stalling his studies. As punishments went, it was remarkably thorough.\n\u201cWhat are we short on?\u201d I asked.\nThere was an art to choosing your projects in the Fishery. It didn\u2019t matter if you made the brightest sympathy lamp, or the most efficient heat-funnel in the history of Artificing. Until someone bought it, you wouldn\u2019t make a bent penny of commission.\nFor a lot of the other workers, this wasn\u2019t an issue. They could afford to wait. I, on the other hand, needed something that would sell quickly.\nJaxim leaned on the counter between us. \u201cCaravan just bought all our deck lamps,\u201d he said. \u201cWe only have that ugly one of Veston\u2019s left.\u201d\nI nodded. Sympathy lamps were perfect for ships. Difficult to break, cheaper than oil in the long run, and you didn\u2019t have to worry about them setting fire to your ship.\nI juggled the numbers in my head. I could make two lamps at once, saving some time through duplication of effort, and be reasonably sure they would sell before I had to pay tuition.\nUnfortunately, deck lamps were pure drudgery. Forty hours of painstaking labor, and if I botched any of it, the lamps simply wouldn\u2019t work. Then I would have nothing to show for my time except a debt to the Stocks for the materials I\u2019d wasted.\nStill, I didn\u2019t have a lot of options. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll do lamps then,\u201d I said.\nJaxim nodded and opened the ledger. I began to recite what I needed from memory. \u201cI\u2019ll need twenty medium raw emitters. Two sets of the tall moldings. A diamond stylus. A tenten glass. Two medium crucibles. Four ounces of tin. Six ounces of fine-steel. Two ounces of nickel . . .\u201d\nNodding to himself, Jaxim wrote it down in the ledger.\n \nEight hours later I walked through the front door of Anker\u2019s smelling of hot bronze, tar, and coal smoke. It was almost midnight, and the room was empty except for a handful of dedicated drinkers.\n\u201cYou look rough,\u201d Anker said as I made my way to the bar.\n\u201cI feel rough,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s anything left in the pot?\u201d\nHe shook his head. \u201cFolk were hungry tonight. I\u2019ve got some cold potatoes\nI was going to throw in the soup tomorrow. And half a baked squash, I think.\u201d\n\u201cSold,\u201d I said. \u201cThough I\u2019d be grateful for some salt butter as well.\u201d He nodded and pushed away from the bar.\n\u201cDon\u2019t bother heating anything up,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll just take it up to my\nroom.\u201d\nHe brought out a bowl with three good-sized potatoes and half a golden\nsquash shaped like a bell. There was a generous daub of butter in the middle of the squash where the seeds had been scooped out.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take a bottle of Bredon beer too,\u201d I said as I took the bowl. \u201cWith the cap on. I don\u2019t want to spill on the stairs.\u201d\nIt was three flights up to my tiny room. After I closed the door, I carefully turned the squash upside down in the bowl, set the bottle on top of it, and wrapped the whole thing in a piece of sackcloth, turning it into a bundle I could carry under one arm.\nThen I opened my window and climbed out onto the roof of the inn. From there it was a short hop over to the bakery across the alley.\nA piece of moon hung low in the sky, giving me enough light to see without making me feel exposed. Not that I was too worried. It was approaching midnight, and the streets were quiet. Besides, you would be amazed how rarely people ever look up.\nAuri sat on a wide brick chimney, waiting for me. She wore the dress I had bought her and swung her bare feet idly as she looked up at the stars. Her hair was so fine and light that it made a halo around her head, drifting on the faintest whisper of a breeze.\nI carefully stepped onto the middle of a flat piece of tin roofing. It made a low tump under my foot, like a distant, mellow drum. Auri\u2019s feet stopped swinging, and she went motionless as a startled rabbit. Then she saw me and grinned. I waved to her.\nAuri hopped down from the chimney and skipped over to where I stood, her hair streaming behind her. \u201cHello Kvothe.\u201d She took a half-step back.", "\u201cYou reek.\u201d\nI smiled my best smile of the day. \u201cHello Auri,\u201d I said. \u201cYou smell like a\npretty young girl.\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d she agreed happily.\nShe stepped sideways a little, then forward again, moving lightly on the\nballs of her bare feet. \u201cWhat did you bring me?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cWhat did you bring me?\u201d I countered.\nShe grinned. \u201cI have an apple that thinks it is a pear,\u201d she said, holding it\nup. \u201cAnd a bun that thinks it is a cat. And a lettuce that thinks it is a lettuce.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a clever lettuce then.\u201d\n\u201cHardly,\u201d she said with a delicate snort. \u201cWhy would anything clever think\nit was a lettuce?\u201d\n\u201cEven if it is a lettuce?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cEspecially then,\u201d she said. \u201cBad enough to be a lettuce. How awful to\nthink you are a lettuce too.\u201d She shook her head sadly, her hair following the motion as if she were underwater.\nI unwrapped my bundle. \u201cI brought you some potatoes, half a squash, and a bottle of beer that thinks it is a loaf of bread.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does the squash think it is?\u201d she asked curiously, looking down at it. She held her hands clasped behind her back.\n\u201cIt knows it\u2019s a squash,\u201d I said. \u201cBut it\u2019s pretending to be the setting sun.\u201d \u201cAnd the potatoes?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cThey\u2019re sleeping,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd cold, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\nShe looked up at me, her eyes gentle. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid,\u201d she said, and\nreached out and rested her fingers on my cheek for the space of a heartbeat, her touch lighter than the stroke of a feather. \u201cI\u2019m here. You\u2019re safe.\u201d\nThe night was chill, and so rather than eat on the rooftops as we often did, Auri led me down through the iron drainage grate and into the sprawl of tunnels beneath the University.\nShe carried the bottle and held aloft something the size of a coin that gave off a gentle greenish light. I carried the bowl and the sympathy lamp I\u2019d made myself, the one Kilvin had called a thieves\u2019 lamp. Its reddish light was an odd complement to Auri\u2019s brighter blue-green one.\n \nAuri brought us to a tunnel with pipes in all shapes and sizes running along the walls. Some of the larger iron pipes carried steam, and even wrapped in insulating cloth they provided a steady heat. Auri carefully arranged the potatoes at a bend in the pipe where the cloth had been peeled away. It made a tiny oven of sorts.\nUsing my sackcloth as a table, we sat on the ground and shared our dinner. The bun was a little stale, but it had nuts and cinnamon in it. The head of lettuce was surprisingly fresh, and I wondered where she had found it. She had a porcelain teacup for me, and a tiny silver beggar\u2019s cup for herself. She poured the beer so solemnly you\u2019d think she was having tea with the king.\nThere was no talking during dinner. That was one of the rules I had learned through trial and error. No touching. No sudden movement. No questions even remotely personal. I could not ask about the lettuce or the green coin. Such a thing would send her scampering off into the tunnels, and I wouldn\u2019t see her for days afterward.\nTruth be told, I didn\u2019t even know her real name. Auri was just what I had come to call her, but in my heart I thought of her as my little moon Fae.\nAs always, Auri ate delicately. She sat with her back straight, taking small bites. She had a spoon we used to eat the squash, sharing it back and forth.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t bring your lute,\u201d she said after we had finished eating.\n\u201cI have to go read tonight,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll bring it soon.\u201d\n\u201cHow soon?\u201d\n\u201cSix nights from now,\u201d I said. I\u2019d be finished with admissions then, and\nmore studying would be pointless.\nHer tiny face pulled a frown. \u201cSix days isn\u2019t soon,\u201d she said. \u201cTomorrow is\nsoon.\u201d\n\u201cSix days is soon for a stone,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThen play for a stone in six days,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd play for me tomorrow.\u201d \u201cI think you can be a stone for six days,\u201d I said. \u201cIt is better than being a\nlettuce.\u201d\nShe grinned at that. \u201cIt is.\u201d\nAfter we finished the last of the apple, Auri led me through the\nUnderthing. We went quietly along the Nodway, jumped our way through Vaults, then entered Billows, a maze of tunnels filled with a slow, steady wind. I probably could have found my own way, but I preferred to have Auri as a guide. She knew the Underthing like a tinker knows his packs.\nWilem was right, I was banned from the Archives. But I\u2019ve always had a", "knack for getting into places where I shouldn\u2019t be. More\u2019s the pity. Archives was a huge windowless stone block of a building. But the\nstudents inside needed fresh air to breathe, and the books needed more than that. If the air was too moist, the books would rot and mildew. If the air was too dry, the parchment would become brittle and fall to pieces.\nIt had taken me a long time to discover how fresh air made its way into the Archives. But even after I found the proper tunnel, getting in wasn\u2019t easy. It involved a long crawl through a terrifyingly narrow tunnel, a quarter hour worming along on my belly across the dirty stone. I kept a set of clothes in the Underthing, and after barely a dozen trips, were thoroughly ruined, the knees and elbows almost entirely torn out.\nStill, it was a small price to pay for gaining access to the Archives.\nThere would be hell to pay if I were ever caught. I\u2019d face expulsion at the very least. But if I performed poorly in my admissions exam and received a tuition of twenty talents, I\u2019d be just as good as expelled. So it was a horse apiece, really.\nEven so, I wasn\u2019t worried about being caught. The only lights in the Stacks were carried by students and scrivs. This meant it was always nighttime in the Archives, and I have always been most comfortable at night.", ""], "CHAPTER FIVE": ["CHAPTER FIVE\nThe Eolian\nTHE DAYS TRUDGED PAST. I worked in the Fishery until my fingers were numb, then read in the Archives until my eyes were blurry.\nOn the fifth day of admissions I finally finished my deck lamps and took them to Stocks, hoping they sold quickly. I considered starting another pair, but I knew I wouldn\u2019t have time to finish them before tuition was due.\nSo I set about making money in other ways. I played an extra night at Anker\u2019s, earning free drinks and a handful of small change from appreciative audience members. I did some piecework in the Fishery, making simple, useful items like brass gears and panes of twice-tough glass. Such things could be sold back to the workshop immediately for a tiny profit.\nThen, since tiny profits weren\u2019t going to be enough, I made two batches of yellow emitters. When used to make a sympathy lamp, their light was a pleasant yellow very close to sunlight. They were worth quite a bit of money because doping them required dangerous materials.\nHeavy metals and vaporous acids were the least of them. The bizarre alchemical compounds were the truly frightening things. There were transporting agents that would move through your skin without a leaving a mark, then quietly eat the calcuim out of your bones. Others would simply lurk in your body, doing nothing for months until you started to bleed from your gums and lose your hair. The things they produced in Alchemy Complex made arsenic look like sugar in your tea.\nI was painstakingly careful, but while working on the second batch of emitters my tenten glass cracked and tiny drops of transporting agent spattered the glass of the fume hood where I was working. None of it actually touched my skin, but a single drop landed on my shirt, high above the long cuffs of the leather gloves I was wearing.\nMoving slowly, I used a nearby caliper to pinch the fabric of my shirt and pull it away from my body. Then, moving awkwardly, I cut the piece of fabric away so it had no chance at all of touching my skin. The incident left", "me shaken and sweating, and I decided there were better ways to earn money. I covered a fellow student\u2019s observation shift in the Medica in exchange\nfor a jot and helped a merchant unload three wagonloads of lime for halfpenny each. Then, later that night, I found a handful of cutthroat gamblers willing to let me sit in on their game of breath. Over the course of two hours I managed to lose eighteen pennies and some loose iron. Though it galled me, I forced myself to walk away from the table before things got any worse.\nAt the end of all my scrambling, I had less in my purse than when I had begun.\nLuckily, I had one last trick up my sleeve.\nI stretched my legs on the wide stone road, heading to Imre.\nAccompanying me were Simmon and Wilem.Wil had ended up selling his\nlate slot to a desperate scriv for a tidy profit, so both of them were finished with admissions and carefree as kittens. Wil\u2019s tuition was set at six talents and eight, while Sim was still gloating over his impressively low five talents and two.\nMy purse held one talent and three. An inauspicious number.\nCompleting our quartet was Manet. His wild grey hair and habitually rumpled clothes made him look vaguely bewildered, as if he\u2019d just woken up and couldn\u2019t quite remember where he was. We had brought him along partly because we needed a fourth for corners, but also because we felt it was our duty to get the poor fellow out of the University every once in a while.\nThe four of us made our way over the high arch of Stonebridge, across the Omethi River, and into Imre. Autumn was in its last gasp, and I wore my cloak against the chance of a chill. My lute was slung comfortably across my back.\nAt the heart of Imre we crossed a great cobblestone courtyard and walked past the central fountain filled with statues of satyrs chasing nymphs. Water splashed and fanned in the breeze as we joined the line leading to the Eolian.\nWhen we got to the door I was surprised to see Deoch wasn\u2019t there. In his place was a short, grim man with a thick neck. He held out a hand. \u201cThat\u2019ll be a jot, young sir.\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d I moved the strap of my lute case out of the way and showed him\n \nthe small set of silver pipes pinned to my cloak. I gestured to Wil, Sim, and Manet. \u201cThey\u2019re with me.\u201d\nHe squinted at the pipes suspiciously. \u201cYou look awfully young,\u201d he said, his eyes darting back to my face.\n\u201cI am awfully young,\u201d I said easily. \u201cIt\u2019s part of my charm.\u201d\n\u201cAwfully young to have your pipes,\u201d he clarified, making it a reasonably polite accusation.\nI hesitated. While I looked old for my age, that meant I looked a few years better than my actual fifteen. To the best of my knowledge, I was the youngest musician at the Eolian. Normally this worked in my favor, as it made me a bit of a novelty. But now . . .\nBefore I could think of anything to say, a voice came from the line behind us. \u201cIt\u2019s not a fake, Kett.\u201d A tall woman carrying a fiddle case nodded at me. \u201cHe earned his pipes while you were away. He\u2019s the real thing.\u201d\n\u201cThanks Marie,\u201d I said as the doorman gestured us inside.\nThe four of us found a table near the back wall with a good view of the stage. I scanned the nearby faces and staved off a familiar flicker of disappointment when Denna was nowhere to be seen.\n\u201cWhat was that business at the door?\u201d Manet asked as he looked around, taking in the stage, the high, vaulted ceiling. \u201cWere people paying to get in here?\u201d\nI looked at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve been a student for thirty years, but never been to the Eolian?\u201d\n\u201cWell, you know.\u201d He made a vague gesture. \u201cI\u2019ve been busy. I don\u2019t get over to this side of the river very often.\u201d\nSim laughed, sitting down. \u201cLet me put this in terms you\u2019ll understand, Manet. If music had a University, this would be it, and Kvothe would be a full-fledged arcanist.\u201d\n\u201cBad analogy,\u201d Wil said. \u201cThis is a musical court, and Kvothe is one of the gentry. We ride his coattails in. It is the reason we have tolerated his troublesome company for so long.\u201d\n\u201cA whole jot just to get in?\u201d Manet asked.\nI nodded.\nManet gave a noncommittal grunt as he looked around, eyeing the well-\ndressed nobles milling on the balcony above. \u201cWell then,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess I learned something today.\u201d", " The Eolian was just beginning to fill up, so we passed the time playing corners. It was just a friendly game, a drab a hand, double for a counterfeit, but coin-poor as I was, any stakes were high. Luckily, Manet played with the precision of a gear-clock: no mislaid tricks, no wild bids, no hunches.\nSimmon bought the first round of drinks, and Manet bought the second. By the time the Eolian\u2019s lights dimmed, Manet and I were ten hands ahead, largely due to Simmon\u2019s tendency to enthusiastically overbid. I pocketed the single copper jot with grim satisfaction. One talent and four.\nAn older man made his way up onto the stage. After a brief introduction by Stanchion he played a heart-achingly lovely version of \u201cTaetn\u2019s Late Day\u201d on mandolin. His fingers were light and quick and sure on his strings. But his voice . . .\nMost things fail with age. Our hands and backs stiffen. Our eyes dim. Skin roughens and our beauty fades. The only exception is the voice. Properly cared for, a voice does nothing but grow sweeter with age and constant use. His was like a sweet honey wine. He finished his song to hearty applause, and after a moment the lights came back up and the room swelled with conversation.\n\u201cThere\u2019s breaks between the performers,\u201d I explained to Manet. \u201cSo folk can talk and walk around and get their drinks. Tehlu and all his angels won\u2019t be able to keep you safe if you talk during someone\u2019s performance.\u201d\nManet huffed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me embarrassing you. I\u2019m not a complete barbarian.\u201d\n\u201cJust giving fair warning,\u201d I said. \u201cYou let me know what\u2019s dangerous in the Artificery. I let you know what\u2019s dangerous here.\u201d\n\u201cHis lute was different,\u201d Wilem said. \u201cIt sounded different than yours. Smaller too.\u201d\nI fought off the urge to smile and decided not to make an issue of it. \u201cThat sort of lute is called a mandolin,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to play, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Simmon asked, squirming in his seat like an eager puppy. \u201cYou should play that song you wrote about Ambrose.\u201d He hummed a bit, then sang:\nA mule can learn magic, a mule has some class, Cause unlike young Rosey, he\u2019s just half an ass.", "Manet chuckled into his mug. Wilem cracked a rare smile.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cI\u2019m done with Ambrose. We\u2019re quits as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Wil said, deadpan.\n\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d I said. \u201cThere\u2019s no profit in it. This back and forth does nothing but irritate the masters.\u201d\n\u201cIrritate is rather a mild word,\u201d Manet said dryly. \u201cNot exactly the one I would have chosen, myself.\u201d\n\u201cYou owe him,\u201d Sim said, his eyes glittering with anger. \u201cBesides, they aren\u2019t going to charge you with Conduct Unbecoming a Member of the Arcanum just for singing a song.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Manet said. \u201cThey\u2019ll just raise his tuition.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Simmon said. \u201cThey can\u2019t do that. Tuition is based on your admissions interview.\u201d\nManet\u2019s snort echoed hollowly into his mug as he took another drink. \u201cThe interview is just a piece of the game. If you can afford it, they squeeze you a little. Same thing if you cause them trouble.\u201d He eyed me seriously. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be getting it from both ends this time. How many times were you brought up on the horns last term?\u201d\n\u201cTwice.\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut the second time wasn\u2019t really my fault.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Manet gave me a frank look. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why they tied you up and whipped you bloody, is it? Because it wasn\u2019t your fault?\u201d\nI shifted uncomfortably in my chair, feeling the pull of the half-healed scars along my back. \u201cMost of it wasn\u2019t my fault,\u201d I amended.\nManet shrugged it aside. \u201cFault isn\u2019t the issue. A tree doesn\u2019t make a thunderstorm, but any fool knows where lightning\u2019s going to strike.\u201d\nWilem nodded seriously. \u201cBack home we say: the tallest nail gets hammered down first.\u201d He frowned. \u201cIt sounds better in Siaru.\u201d\nSim looked troubled. \u201cBut the admission interview still determines the lion\u2019s share of your tuition, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d From his tone, I guessed Sim hadn\u2019t even considered the possibility of personal grudges or politics entering into the equation.\n\u201cFor the most part,\u201d Manet admitted. \u201cBut the masters pick their own questions, and they each get their say.\u201d He began to tick things off on his fingers. \u201cHemme doesn\u2019t care for you, and he can carry twice his weight in grudges. You got on Lorren\u2019s bad side early and managed to stay there.", "You\u2019re a troublemaker. You missed nearly a span of classes toward the end of last term. No warning beforehand or any explanation afterward.\u201d He gave me a significant look.\nI looked down at the table, pointedly aware that several of the classes I\u2019d missed had been part of my apprenticeship under Manet in the Artificery.\nAfter a moment, Manet shrugged and continued. \u201cOn top of it all, they\u2019ll be testing you as a Re\u2019lar this time around. Tuitions get higher in the upper ranks. There\u2019s a reason I\u2019ve stayed an E\u2019lir this long.\u201d He gave me a hard stare. \u201cMy best guess? You\u2019ll be lucky to get out for less than ten talents.\u201d\n\u201cTen talents.\u201d Sim sucked a breath through his teeth and shook his head sympathetically. \u201cGood thing you\u2019re so flush.\u201d\n\u201cNot as flush as that,\u201d I said.\n\u201cHow can you not be?\u201d Sim asked. \u201cThe masters fined Ambrose almost twenty talents after he broke your lute. What did you do with all the money?\u201d\nI looked down and nudged my lute case gently with my foot.\n\u201cYou spent it on a new lute?\u201d Simmon asked, horrified. \u201cTwenty talents? Do you know what you could buy for that amount of money?\u201d\n\u201cA lute?\u201d Wilem asked.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know you could spend that much on an instrument,\u201d Simmon said.\n\u201cYou can spend a lot more than that,\u201d Manet said. \u201cThey\u2019re like horses.\u201d\nThis made the conversation stumble a bit. Wil and Sim turned to look at him, confused.\nI laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s a good comparison, actually.\u201d\nManet nodded sagely. \u201cThere\u2019s a wide spread with horses, you see. You can buy a broken old plow horse for less than a talent. Or you can buy a high- stepping Vaulder for forty.\u201d\n\u201cNot likely,\u201dWil grunted. \u201cNot for a true Vaulder.\u201d\nManet smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s it exactly. However much you\u2019ve ever known someone to spend on a horse, you could easily spend that buying yourself a fine harp or fiddle.\u201d\nSimmon looked stunned by this. \u201cBut my father once spent two hundred fifty hard on a Kaepcaen tall,\u201d he said.\nI leaned to one side and pointed. \u201cThe blond man there, his mandolin is worth twice that.\u201d\n\u201cBut,\u201d Simmon said. \u201cBut horses have bloodlines. You can breed a horse and sell it.\u201d", "\u201cThat mandolin has a bloodline,\u201d I said. \u201cIt was made by Antressor himself. It\u2019s been around for a hundred and fifty years.\u201d\nI watched as Sim absorbed the information, looking around at all the instruments in the room. \u201cStill,\u201d Sim said. \u201cTwenty talents.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait until after admissions? You could have spent whatever you had left over on the lute.\u201d\n\u201cI needed it to play at Anker\u2019s,\u201d I explained. \u201cI get free room and board as their house musician. If I don\u2019t play, I can\u2019t stay.\u201d\nIt was the truth, but it wasn\u2019t the whole truth. Anker would have cut me some slack if I\u2019d explained my situation. But if I\u2019d waited, I would have had to spend almost two span without a lute. It would be like missing a tooth or a limb. It would be like spending two span with my mouth sewn shut. It was unthinkable.\n\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t spend all of it on the lute,\u201d I said. \u201cI had a few other expenses crop up too.\u201d Specifically, I\u2019d paid off the gaelet I\u2019d borrowed money from. That had taken six talents, but being free of my debt to Devi was like having a great weight lifted off my chest.\nBut now I could feel that same weight settling back onto me. If Manet\u2019s guess was even half-accurate, I was worse off than I\u2019d thought.\nFortunately, the lights dimmed and the room grew quiet, saving me from having to explain myself any further. We looked up as Stanchion brought Marie up onto the stage. He chatted with the nearby audience while she tuned her fiddle and the room began to settle down.\nI liked Marie. She was taller than most men, proud as a cat, and spoke at least four languages. Many of Imre\u2019s musicians did their best to mimic the latest fashion, hoping to blend in with the nobility, but Marie wore road clothes. Pants you could do a day\u2019s work in, boots you could use to walk twenty miles.\nI don\u2019t mean to imply she wore homespun, mind you. She just had no love for fashion or frippery. Her clothes were obviously tailored for her, close fitting and flattering. Tonight she wore burgundy and brown, the colors of her patron, the Lady Jhale.\nThe four of us eyed the stage. \u201cI will admit,\u201d Wilem said quietly, \u201cthat I have given Marie a fair amount of consideration.\u201d\nManet gave a low chuckle. \u201cThat is a woman and a half,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich means she\u2019s five times more woman than any of you know what to do with.\u201d At a different time, such a statement might have goaded the three of us into", "swaggering protest. But Manet stated it without a hint of taunt in his voice, so we let it pass. Especially as it was probably true.\n\u201cNot for me,\u201d Simmon said. \u201cShe always looks like she\u2019s getting ready to wrestle someone. Or go off and break a wild horse.\u201d\n\u201cShe does.\u201d Manet chuckled again. \u201cIf we were living in a better age they\u2019d build a temple around a woman like that.\u201d\nWe fell silent as Marie finished tuning her fiddle and eased into a sweet roundel, slow and gentle as a soft spring breeze.\nThough I didn\u2019t have time to tell him, Simmon was more than half right. Once, in the Flint and Thistle, I had seen Marie punch a man in the throat for referring to her as \u201cthat mouthy fiddler bitch.\u201d She kicked him when he was on the ground, too. But only once, and nowhere that hurt him in a permanent way.\nMarie continued her roundel, the slow, sweet pace of it gradually building until it was trotting along briskly. The sort of tune you would only think of dancing to if you were exceptionally light on your feet, or exceptionally drunk.\nShe let it build until it was beyond anything a man could dream of dancing to. It was nothing like a trot now. It sprinted, fast as a pair of children racing. I marveled at how clean and clear her fingering was despite the frantic pace.\nFaster. Quick as a deer with a wild dog behind it. I started to get nervous, knowing it was just a matter of time before she slid or slipped or dropped a note. But somehow she kept going, each note perfect, sharp and strong and sweet. Her flickering fingers arched high against the strings. The wrist of her bow hand hung loose and lazy despite the terrible speed.\nFaster still. Her face was intent. Her bow arm a blur. Faster still. She braced herself, her long legs planted firmly on the stage, her fiddle tucked hard against her jaw. Each note sharp as early morning birdsong. Faster still.\nShe finished in a rush and gave a sudden, flourishing bow without a single mistake. I was sweating like a hard-run horse, my heart racing.\nI wasn\u2019t the only one. Wil and Sim each had a sheen of sweat across their foreheads.\nManet\u2019s knuckles were white where he gripped the edge of the table. \u201cMerciful Tehlu,\u201d he said breathlessly. \u201cThey have music like this every night?\u201d\nI smiled at him. \u201cIt\u2019s still early,\u201d I said. \u201cYou haven\u2019t heard me play.\u201d", " Wilem bought the next round of drinks and our talk turned to the idle gossip of the University. Manet had been around for longer than half of the masters, so he knew more scandalous stories than the three of us put together.\nA lutist with a thick grey beard played a stirring version of \u201cEn Faeant Morie.\u201d Then two lovely women, one in her forties and the other young enough to be her daughter, sang a duet about Laniel Young-Again I\u2019d never heard before.\nMarie was called back onto the stage and played a simple jig with such enthusiasm that it set folk dancing in the spaces between the tables. Manet actually stood for the final chorus and surprised us by demonstrating a pair of remarkably light feet. We cheered him, and when he took his seat again he was flushed and breathing hard.\nWil bought him a drink, and Simmon turned to me with excitement in his eyes.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to play it. I already told you.\u201d\nSim deflated into such profound disappointment that I couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what. I\u2019ll take a turn around the place. If I see Threpe, I\u2019ll put him up to it.\u201d\nI made my slow way through the crowded room, and while I did keep an eye out for Threpe, the truth is I was hunting for Denna. I hadn\u2019t seen her come in by the front door, but with the music, cards, and general commotion there was a chance I\u2019d simply missed her.\nIt took a quarter hour to methodically make my way through the crowded main floor, getting a look at all the faces and stopping to chat with a few of the musicians along the way.\nI made my way up to the second tier just as the lights dimmed again. I settled in at the railing to watch a Yllish piper play a sad, lilting tune.\nWhen the lights came back up, I searched the second tier of the Eolian: a wide, crescent-shaped balcony. My search was more a ritual than anything. Looking for Denna was an exercise in futility, like praying for fair weather.\nBut tonight was the exception to the rule. As I strolled through the second tier I spotted her walking with a tall, dark-haired gentleman. I changed my path through the tables so I would intercept them casually.\nDenna spotted me half a minute later. She gave a bright, excited smile and took her hand off the gentleman\u2019s arm, motioning me closer.", "The man at her side was proud as a hawk and handsome, with a jawline like a cinder brick. He wore a shirt of blindingly white silk and a richly dyed suede jacket the color of blood. Silver stitching. Silver on the buckle and the cuff. He looked every bit the Modegan gentleman. The cost of his clothes, not even counting his rings, would have paid my tuition for a solid year.\nDenna was playing the part of his charming and attractive companion. In the past I had seen her dressed much the same as myself: plain clothes meant for hard wear and travel. But tonight she wore a long dress of green silk. Her dark hair curled artfully around her face and tumbled down her shoulders. At her throat was an emerald pendant shaped like a smooth teardrop. It matched the color of the dress so perfectly that it couldn\u2019t be coincidence.\nI felt a little shabby by comparison. More than a little. Every piece of clothing I owned in the world amounted to four shirts, two sets of pants, and a few sundries. All of it secondhand and threadbare to some degree. I was wearing my best tonight, but I\u2019m sure you understand when I say my best was not particularly fine.\nThe one exception was my cloak, Fela\u2019s gift. It was warm and wonderful, tailored for me in green and black with numerous pockets in the lining. It wasn\u2019t elegant by any measure, but it was the finest thing I owned.\nAs I approached, Denna stepped forward and held out her hand for me to kiss, the gesture poised, almost haughty. Her expression was composed, her smile polite. To the casual observer she looked every bit the genteel lady being gracious to a poor young musician.\nAll except her eyes. They were dark and deep, the color of coffee and chocolate. Her eyes were dancing with amusement, full of laughter. Standing behind her, the gentleman gave a bare hint of a frown when she offered me her hand. I didn\u2019t know what game Denna was playing, but I could guess my part.\nSo I bent over her hand, kissing it lightly in a low bow. I had been trained in courtly manners at an early age, so I knew what I was doing. Anyone can bend at the waist, but a good bow takes skill.\nThis one was gracious and flattering, and as I pressed my lips to the back of her hand I flared my cloak to one side with a delicate flick of my wrist. The last was the difficult bit, and it had taken me several hours of careful practice in the bathhouse mirror to get the motion to look sufficiently casual.\nDenna made a curtsey graceful as a falling leaf and stepped back to stand beside the gentleman. \u201cKvothe, this is Lord Kellin Vantenier. Kellin,", "Kvothe.\u201d\nKellin eyed me up and down, forming his full opinion of me more quickly\nthan you can draw a short, sharp breath. His expression became dismissive, and he gave me a nod. I\u2019m no stranger to disdain, but I was surprised how much this particular bit stung me.\n\u201cAt your service, my lord.\u201d I made a polite bow and shifted my weight so my cloak fell away from my shoulder, displaying my talent pipes.\nHe was about to look away with practiced disinterest when his eye snagged on the bright piece of silver. It was nothing special in terms of jewelry, but here it was significant. Wilem was right: at the Eolian, I was one of the gentry.\nAnd Kellin knew it. After a heartbeat of consideration, he returned my bow. It was barely more than a nod, really. Just low enough to be polite. \u201cYours and your family\u2019s,\u201d he said in perfect Aturan. His voice was deeper than mine, a warm bass with enough of a Modegan accent to lend it a slight musical cant.\nDenna inclined her head in his direction. \u201cKellin has been showing me my way around a harp.\u201d\n\u201cI am here to win my pipes,\u201d he said, his deep voice filled with certainty.\nWhen he spoke, women at the surrounding tables turned to look in his direction with hungry, half-lidded eyes. His voice had the opposite effect on me. To be both rich and handsome was bad enough. But to have a voice like honey over warm bread on top of that was simply inexcusable. The sound of it made me feel like a cat grabbed by the tail and rubbed backward with a wet hand.\nI glanced at his hands. \u201cSo you\u2019re a harper?\u201d\n\u201cHarpist,\u201d he corrected stiffly. \u201cI play the Pendenhale. King of instruments.\u201d\nI pulled in half a breath, then closed my mouth. The Modegan great harp had been the king of instruments five hundred years ago. These days it was an antique curiosity. I let it pass, avoiding the argument for Denna\u2019s sake. \u201cWill you be trying your luck tonight?\u201d I asked.\nKellin\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly. \u201cThere will be nothing of luck involved when I play. But no. Tonight I am enjoying my lady Dinael\u2019s company.\u201d He lifted Denna\u2019s hand to his lips and gave it an absentminded kiss. He looked around at the murmuring crowd in a proprietary way, as if he owned them. \u201cI will be in worthy company here, I think.\u201d", "I glanced at Denna, but she was avoiding my eyes. Her head tilted to the side as she toyed with an earring previously hidden in her hair, a tiny teardrop emerald that matched the pendant at her throat.\nKellin\u2019s eyes flickered over me again. My ill-fitting clothes. My hair, too short to be fashionable, too long to be anything other than wild. \u201cAnd you are... a piper?\u201d\nThe least expensive instrument. \u201cPipist,\u201d I said lightly. \u201cBut no. I favor the lute.\u201d\nHis eyebrows went up. \u201cYou play court lute?\u201d\nMy smile stiffened a bit despite my best efforts. \u201cTrouper\u2019s lute.\u201d\n\u201cAh!\u201d he said, laughing as if things suddenly made sense. \u201cFolk music!\u201d I let that pass as well, though less easily than before. \u201cDo you have seats\nyet?\u201d I asked brightly. \u201cSeveral of us have taken a table below with a good view of the stage. You\u2019re welcome to join us.\u201d\n\u201cThe lady and I already have a table in the third circle.\u201d Kellin nodded in Denna\u2019s direction. \u201cI much prefer the company above.\u201d\nOutside his field of vision, Denna rolled her eyes at me.\nI kept a straight face and made another polite bow to him, barely more than a nod. \u201cI won\u2019t delay you then.\u201d\nI turned to Denna. \u201cMy lady. Might I call on you some time?\u201d\nShe sighed, looking every bit the put-upon socialite, except for her eyes, which were still laughing at all the ridiculous formality of the exchange. \u201cI\u2019m sure you understand, Kvothe. My schedule is quite full for the next several days. But you could pay a visit near the end of the span if you wish. I\u2019ve taken rooms at the Grey Man.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re too kind,\u201d I said, and gave her a much more earnest bow than the one I had given Kellin. She rolled her eyes at me this time.\nKellin held out his arm, turning his shoulder to me in the process, and the two of them walked off into the crowd. Watching them together, moving gracefully through the throng, it would be easy to believe they owned the place, or were perhaps thinking of buying it to use as a summer home. Only old nobility move with that easy arrogance, knowing deep in their guts that everything in the world exists only to make them happy. Denna was faking it marvelously, but for Lord Kellin Brickjaw it was as natural as drawing breath.\nI watched until they were halfway up the stairs to the third circle. That\u2019s where Denna stopped and put a hand to her head. Then she looked around at", "the floor, her expression anxious. The two of them spoke briefly and she pointed up the stairs. Kellin nodded and climbed out of sight.\nOn a hunch, I looked down at the floor and spotted a gleam of silver where Denna had been standing near the railing. I moved and stood over it, forcing a pair of Cealdish merchants to detour around me.\nI pretended to watch the crowd below until Denna came close and tapped me on the shoulder. \u201cKvothe,\u201d she said anxiously. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you, but I seem to have lost an earring. Would you be a dear and help me look for it? I\u2019m sure I had it on me just a moment ago.\u201d\nI agreed, and soon we were enjoying a moment of privacy, decorously searching the floorboards with our heads close together. Luckily, Denna\u2019s dress was in the Modegan style, flowing and loose around the legs. If it had been slit up the side according to the current fashion of the Commonwealth, the sight of her crouching on the floor would have been scandalous.\n\u201cGod\u2019s body,\u201d I muttered. \u201cWhere did you find him?\u201d\nDenna chuckled low in her throat. \u201cHush.You\u2019re the one who suggested I learn my way around a harp. Kellin is quite a good teacher.\u201d\n\u201cThe Modegan pedal harp weighs five times as much as you do,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s a parlor instrument.You\u2019d never be able to take one on the road.\u201d\nShe stopped pretending to look for her earring and gave me a pointed look. \u201cAnd who\u2019s to say I won\u2019t ever have a parlor to harp in?\u201d\nI looked back to the floor and gave as much of a shrug as I could manage. \u201cIt\u2019s good enough for learning, I suppose. How are you liking it so far?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s better than the lyre,\u201d she said. \u201cI can already see that. I can barely play \u2018Squirrel in the Thatch,\u2019 though.\u201d\n\u201cIs he any good?\u201d I gave her a sly smile. \u201cWith his hands, I mean.\u201d\nDenna flushed a bit and looked for a second as if she would swat at me. But she remembered her decorum in time and settled for narrowing her eyes instead. \u201cYou\u2019re awful,\u201d she said, \u201cKellin has been a perfect gentleman.\u201d\n\u201cTehlu save us all from perfect gentlemen,\u201d I said.\nShe shook her head. \u201cI meant it in the literal sense,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s never been out of Modeg before. He\u2019s like a kitten in a coop.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re Dinael now?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cFor now. And for him,\u201d she said, looking at me sideways with a small quirk of a smile. \u201cFrom you I still like Denna best.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s good to know,\u201d I said, then lifted my hand off the floor, revealing the smooth emerald teardrop of an earring. Denna made a show of", "discovering it, holding it up to catch the light. \u201cAh! Here we are!\u201d\nI stood and helped her to her feet. She brushed her hair back from her\nshoulder and leaned toward me. \u201cI\u2019m all thumbs with these things,\u201d she said. \u201cWould you mind?\u201d\nI stepped toward her and stood close as she handed me the earring. She smelled faintly of wildflowers. But beneath that she smelled like autumn leaves. Like the dark smell of her own hair, like road dust and the air before a summer storm.\n\u201cSo what is he?\u201d I said softly. \u201cSomeone\u2019s second son?\u201d\nShe gave a barely perceptible shake of her head, and a strand of her hair fell down to brush the back of my hand. \u201cHe\u2019s a lord in his own right.\u201d\n\u201cSkethe te retaa van,\u201d I swore. \u201cLock up your sons and daughters.\u201d Denna laughed again, quietly. Her body shook as she fought to hold it in. \u201cHold still,\u201d I said as I gently took hold of her ear.\nDenna drew a deep breath and let it out again, composing herself. I\nthreaded the earring through the lobe of her ear and stepped away. She lifted one hand to check it, then stepped back and gave a curtsey. \u201cThank you kindly for all your help.\u201d\nI bowed to her again. It wasn\u2019t as polished as the bow I\u2019d given her before, but it was more honest. \u201cI am at your service, my lady.\u201d\nDenna smiled warmly as she turned to go, her eyes laughing again.\nI finished exploring the second tier for the sake of form, but Threpe didn\u2019t seem to be around. Not wanting to risk the awkwardness of a second encounter with Denna and her lordling, I decided to skip the third tier entirely.\nSim had the lively look he gets around his fifth drink. Manet was slouched low in his chair, eyes half-lidded, his mug resting comfortably on the swell of his belly. Wil looked the same as ever, his dark eyes unreadable.\n\u201cThrepe\u2019s nowhere to be found,\u201d I said as I took my seat. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s too bad,\u201d Sim said. \u201cHas he had any luck finding you a patron yet?\u201d\nI shook my head bitterly. \u201cAmbrose has threatened or bribed every noble within a hundred miles of here. They\u2019ll have nothing to do with me.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Threpe take you on himself?\u201d Wilem asked. \u201cHe likes you well enough.\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cThrepe\u2019s already supporting three other musicians. Four really, but two of them are a married couple.\u201d\n\u201cFour?\u201d Sim said, horrified. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonder he can still afford to eat.\u201d\nWil cocked his head curiously, and Sim leaned forward to explain. \u201cThrepe\u2019s a count. But his holdings aren\u2019t really that extensive. Supporting four players on his income is a little . . . extravagant.\u201d\nWil frowned. \u201cDrinks and strings can\u2019t amount to much.\u201d\n\u201cA patron\u2019s responsible for more than that.\u201d Sim began to count items off on his fingers. \u201cThere\u2019s the writ of patronage itself. Then he provides room and board for his players, a yearly wage, a suit of clothes in his family\u2019s colors\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTwo suits of clothing, traditionally,\u201d I interjected. \u201cEvery year.\u201d Growing up in the troupe, I never appreciated the livery Lord Greyfallow had given us. But these days I couldn\u2019t help but imagine how much my wardrobe would be improved by two new sets of clothing.\nSimmon grinned as a serving boy arrived, leaving no doubt as to who was responsible for the glasses of blackberry brand set in front of each of us. Sim raised his glass in a silent toast and drank a solid swallow. I raised my glass in return, as did Wilem, though it obviously pained him. Manet remained motionless, and I began to suspect he had dozed off.\n\u201cIt still doesn\u2019t add square,\u201d Wilem said, setting down his brand. \u201cAll the patron gets is lighter pockets.\u201d\n\u201cThe patron gets a reputation,\u201d I explained. \u201cThat\u2019s why the players wear the livery. Plus he has entertainers at his beck and call: parties, dances, pageants. Sometimes they\u2019ll write songs or plays at his request.\u201d\nWil still seemed skeptical. \u201cStill seems like the patron is getting the short side of it.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s because you only have half the picture,\u201d Manet said, pulling himself upright in his chair. \u201cYou\u2019re a city boy. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like growing up in a little town built on one man\u2019s land.\n\u201cHere\u2019s Lord Poncington\u2019s lands,\u201d Manet said, using a bit of spilled beer to draw a circle in the center of the table. \u201cWhere you live like the good little commoner you are.\u201d Manet picked up Simmon\u2019s empty glass and put it inside the circle.\n\u201cOne day, a fellow strolls through town wearing Lord Poncington\u2019s", "colors.\u201d Manet picked up his full glass of brand and jigged it across the table until it stood next to Sim\u2019s empty one inside the circle. \u201cAnd this fellow plays songs for everyone at the local inn.\u201d Manet splashed some of the brand into Sim\u2019s glass.\nNot needing any prompting, Sim grinned and drank it.\nManet trotted his glass around the table and entered the circle again. \u201cNext month a couple more folk come through wearing his colors and put on a puppet show.\u201d He poured more brand and Simmon tossed it back. \u201cThe next month there\u2019s a play.\u201d Again.\nNow Manet picked up his wooden mug and clomped it across the table into the circle. \u201cThen the tax man shows up, wearing the same colors.\u201d Manet knocked his empty mug impatiently on the table.\nSim sat confused for a second, then he picked up his own mug and sloshed some beer into it.\nManet eyed him and tapped the mug again, sternly.\nSim poured the rest of his beer into Manet\u2019s mug, laughing. \u201cI like blackberry brand better anyway.\u201d\n\u201cLord Poncington likes his taxes better,\u201d Manet said. \u201cAnd people like to be entertained. And the tax man likes not being poisoned and buried in a shallow grave behind the old mill.\u201d He took a drink of beer. \u201cSo it works out nicely for everyone.\u201d\nWil watched the exchange with his serious, dark eyes. \u201cThat makes better sense.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not always as mercenary as that,\u201d I said. \u201cThrepe genuinely wants to help musicians improve their craft. Some nobles treat their performers like horses in a stable,\u201d I sighed. \u201cEven that would be better than what I have now, which is nothing.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t sell yourself cheap,\u201d Sim said cheerfully. \u201cWait and get a good patron. You deserve it. You\u2019re as good as any musician here.\u201d\nI kept silent, too proud to tell them the truth. I was poor in a way the rest of them could hardly understand. Sim was Aturan nobility, and Wil\u2019s family were wool merchants from Ralien. They thought being poor meant not having enough money to go drinking as often as they liked.\nWith tuition looming, I didn\u2019t dare spend a bent penny. I couldn\u2019t buy candles, or ink, or paper. I had no jewelry to pawn, no allowance, no parents to write home to. No respectable moneylender would give me a thin shim. Hardly surprising, as I was a rootless, orphan Edema Ruh whose possessions", "would fit into a burlap sack. It wouldn\u2019t have to be a large sack either. I got to my feet before the conversation had a chance to wander into\nuncomfortable territory. \u201cIt\u2019s time I made some music.\u201d\nI picked up my lute case and made my way to where Stanchion sat at the\ncorner of the bar. \u201cWhat have you got for us tonight?\u201d he asked, running his hand over his beard.\n\u201cA surprise.\u201d\nStanchion paused in the act of getting off his stool. \u201cIs this the sort of surprise that\u2019s going to cause a riot or make folk set my place on fire?\u201d he asked.\nI shook my head, smiling.\n\u201cGood.\u201d He smiled and headed off in the direction of the stage. \u201cIn that case I like surprises.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER SIX": ["CHAPTER SIX\nLove\nSTANCHION LED ME ONTO the stage and brought out an armless chair. Then he walked to the front of the stage to chat with the audience. I spread my cloak over the back of the chair as the lights began to dim.\nI laid my battered lute case on the floor. It was even shabbier than I was. It had been quite nice once, but that was years ago and miles away. Now the leather hinges were cracked and stiff, and the body was worn thin as parchment in places. Only one of the original clasps remained, a delicate thing of worked silver. I\u2019d replaced the others with whatever I could scavenge, so now the case sported mismatched clasps of bright brass and dull iron.\nBut inside the case was something else entirely. Inside was the reason I was scrambling for tuition tomorrow. I had driven a hard bargain for it, and even then it had cost me more money than I had ever spent on anything in my life. So much money I couldn\u2019t afford a case that fit it properly, and made do by padding my old one with rags.\nThe wood was the color of dark coffee, of freshly turned earth. The curve of the bowl was perfect as a woman\u2019s hip. It was hushed echo and bright string and thrum. My lute. My tangible soul.\nI have heard what poets write about women. They rhyme and rhapsodize and lie. I have watched sailors on the shore stare mutely at the slow-rolling swell of the sea. I have watched old soldiers with hearts like leather grow teary-eyed at their king\u2019s colors stretched against the wind.\nListen to me: these men know nothing of love.\nYou will not find it in the words of poets or the longing eyes of sailors. If you want to know of love, look to a trouper\u2019s hands as he makes his music. A trouper knows.\nI looked out at my audience as they grew slowly still. Simmon waved enthusiastically, and I smiled in return. I saw Count Threpe\u2019s white hair near the rail on the second tier now. He was speaking earnestly to the well-dressed", "couple, gesturing in my direction. Still campaigning on my behalf though we both knew it was a hopeless cause.\nI brought the lute out of its shabby case and began to tune it. It was not the finest lute in the Eolian. Not by half. Its neck was slightly bent, but not bowed. One of the pegs was loose and was prone to changing its tune.\nI brushed a soft chord and tipped my ear to the strings. As I looked up, I could see Denna\u2019s face, clear as the moon. She smiled excitedly at me and wiggled her fingers below the level of the table where her gentleman couldn\u2019t see.\nI touched the loose peg gently, running my hands over the warm wood of the lute. The varnish was scraped and scuffed in places. It had been treated unkindly in the past, but that didn\u2019t make it less lovely underneath.\nSo yes. It had flaws, but what does that matter when it comes to matters of the heart? We love what we love. Reason does not enter into it. In many ways, unwise love is the truest love. Anyone can love a thing because.That\u2019s as easy as putting a penny in your pocket. But to love something despite. To know the flaws and love them too. That is rare and pure and perfect.\nStanchion made a sweeping gesture in my direction. There was brief applause followed by an attentive hush.\nI plucked two notes and felt the audience lean toward me. I touched a string, tuned it slightly, and began to play. Before a handful of notes rang out, everyone had caught the tune.\nIt was \u201cBell-Wether.\u201d A tune shepherds have been whistling for ten thousand years. The simplest of simple melodies. A tune anyone with a bucket could carry. A bucket was overkill, actually. A pair of cupped hands would manage nicely. A single hand. Two fingers, even.\nIt was, plainly said, folk music.\nThere have been a hundred songs written to the tune of \u201cBell-Wether.\u201d Songs of love and war. Songs of humor, tragedy, and lust. I did not bother with any of these. No words. Just the music. Just the tune.\nI looked up and saw Lord Brickjaw leaning close to Denna, making a dismissive gesture. I smiled as I teased the song carefully from the strings of my lute.\nBut before much longer, my smile grew strained. Sweat began to bead on my forehead. I hunched over the lute, concentrating on what my hands were doing. My fingers darted, then danced, then flew.\nI played hard as a hailstorm, like a hammer beating brass. I played soft as", "sun on autumn wheat, gentle as a single stirring leaf. Before long, my breath began to catch from the strain of it. My lips made a thin, bloodless line across my face.\nAs I pushed through the middle refrain I shook my head to clear my hair away from my eyes. Sweat flew in an arc to patter out along the wood of the stage. I breathed hard, my chest working like a bellows, straining like a horse run to lather.\nThe song rang out, each note bright and clear. I almost stumbled once. The rhythm faltered for the space of a split hair. . . .Then somehow I recovered, pushed through, and managed to finish the final line, plucking the notes sweet and light despite the fact that my fingers were a weary blur.\nThen, just when it was obvious I couldn\u2019t carry on a moment longer, the last chord rang through the room and I slumped in my chair, exhausted.\nThe audience burst into thunderous applause.\nBut not the whole audience. Scattered through the room dozens of people burst into laughter instead, a few of them pounding the tables and stomping the floor, shouting their amusement.\nThe applause sputtered and died almost immediately. Men and women stopped with their hands frozen midclap as they stared at the laughing members of the audience. Some looked angry, others confused. Many were plainly offended on my behalf, and angry mutterings began to ripple through the room.\nBefore any serious discussion could take root, I struck a single high note and held up a hand, pulling their attention back to me. I wasn\u2019t done yet. Not by half.\nI shifted in my seat and rolled my shoulders. I strummed once, touched the loose peg, and rolled effortlessly into my second song.\nIt was one of Illien\u2019s: \u201cTintatatornin.\u201d I doubt you\u2019ve ever heard of it. It\u2019s something of an oddity compared to Illien\u2019s other works. First, it has no lyrics. Second, while it\u2019s a lovely song, it isn\u2019t nearly as catchy or moving as many of his better-known melodies.\nMost importantly, it is perversely difficult to play. My father referred to it as \u201cthe finest song ever written for fifteen fingers.\u201d He made me play it when I was getting too full of myself and felt I needed humbling. Suffice to say I practiced it with fair regularity, sometimes more than once a day.\nSo I played \u201cTintatatornin.\u201d I leaned back into my chair and crossed my ankles, relaxing a bit. My hands strolled idly over the strings. After the first", "chorus, I drew a breath and gave a short sigh, like a young boy trapped inside on a sunny day. My eyes began to wander aimlessly around the room, bored. Still playing, I fidgeted in my seat, trying to find a comfortable position\nand failing. I frowned, stood up, and looked at the chair as if it was somehow to blame. Then I reclaimed my seat and wriggled, an uncomfortable expression on my face.\nAll the while the ten thousand notes of \u201cTintatatornin\u201d danced and capered. I took a moment between one chord and the next to scratch myself idly behind the ear.\nI was so deeply into my little act that I actually felt a yawn swelling up. I let it out in full earnest, so wide and long that the people the front row could count my teeth. I shook my head as if to clear it, and daubed at my watery eyes with my sleeve.\nThrough all of this, \u201cTintatatornin\u201d tripped into the air. Maddening harmony and counterpoint weaving together, skipping apart. All of it flawless and sweet and easy as breathing. When the end came, drawing together a dozen tangled threads of song, I made no flourish. I simply stopped and rubbed my eyes a bit. No crescendo. No bow. Nothing. I cracked my knuckles distractedly and leaned forward to set my lute back in the case.\nThis time the laughter came first. The same people as before, hooting and hammering at their tables twice as loudly as before. My people. The musicians. I let my bored expression fall away and grinned knowingly out at them.\nThe applause followed a few heartbeats later, but it was scattered and confused. Even before the house lights rose, it had dissolved into a hundred murmuring discussions throughout the room.\nMarie rushed up to greet me as I came down the stairs, her face full of laughter. She shook my hand and clapped me on the back. She was the first of many, all musicians. Before I could get bogged down, Marie linked her arm in mine and led me back to my table.\n\u201cGood lord, boy,\u201d Manet said. \u201cYou\u2019re like a tiny king here.\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t half the attention he usually gets,\u201d Wilem said. \u201cNormally they\u2019re still cheering when he makes it back to the table. Young women bat their eyes and strew his path with flowers.\u201d\nSim looked around the room curiously. \u201cThe reaction did seem . . .\u201d he groped for a word. \u201cMixed. Why is that?\u201d\n\u201cBecause young six-string here is so sharp he can hardly help but cut", "himself,\u201d Stanchion said as he made his way over to our table. \u201cYou\u2019ve noticed that too?\u201d Manet asked dryly.\n\u201cHush,\u201d Marie said. \u201cIt was brilliant.\u201d\nStanchion sighed and shook his head.\n\u201cI for one,\u201d Wilem said pointedly, \u201cwould like to know what is being discussed.\u201d\n\u201cKvothe here played the simplest song in the world and made it look like he was spinning gold out of flax,\u201d Marie said. \u201cThen he took a real piece of music, something only a handful of folk in the whole place could play, and made it look so easy you\u2019d think a child could blow it on a tin whistle.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not denying that it was cleverly done,\u201d Stanchion said. \u201cThe problem is the way he did it. Everyone who jumped in clapping on the first song feels like an idiot. They feel they\u2019ve been toyed with.\u201d\n\u201cWhich they were,\u201d Marie pointed out. \u201cA performer manipulates the audience. That\u2019s the point of the joke.\u201d\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t like being toyed with,\u201d Stanchion replied. \u201cThey resent it, in fact. Nobody likes having a joke played on them.\u201d\n\u201cTechnically,\u201d Simmon interjected, grinning, \u201che played the joke on the lute.\u201d\nEveryone turned to look at him, and his grin faded a bit. \u201cYou see? He actually played a joke. On a lute.\u201d He looked down at the table, his grin fading as his face flushed a sudden embarrassed red. \u201cSorry.\u201d\nMarie laughed an easy laugh.\nManet spoke up. \u201cSo it\u2019s really an issue of two audiences,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cThere\u2019s those that know enough about music to get the joke, and those who need the joke explained to them.\u201d\nMarie made a triumphant gesture toward Manet. \u201cThat\u2019s it exactly,\u201d she said to Stanchion. \u201cIf you come here and don\u2019t know enough to get the joke on your own, then you deserve to have your nose tweaked a bit.\u201d\n\u201cExcept most of those people are the gentry,\u201d Stanchion said. \u201cAnd our clever-jack doesn\u2019t have a patron yet.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Marie said. \u201cThrepe put word out months ago.Why hasn\u2019t someone snatched you up?\u201d\n\u201cAmbrose Jakis,\u201d I explained.\nHer face didn\u2019t show any recognition. \u201cIs he a musician?\u201d\n\u201cBaron\u2019s son,\u201d Wilem said.\nShe gave a puzzled frown. \u201cHow can he possibly keep you away from a", "patron?\u201d\n\u201cAmple free time and twice as much money as God,\u201d I said dryly.\n\u201cHis father\u2019s one of the most powerful men in Vintas,\u201d Manet added, then\nturned to Simmon. \u201cWhat is he, sixteenth in line to the throne?\u201d \u201cThirteenth,\u201d Simmon said sullenly. \u201cThe entire Surthen family was lost at\nsea two months ago. Ambrose won\u2019t shut up about the fact that his father\u2019s barely a dozen steps from being king.\u201d\nManet turned back to Marie. \u201cThe point is, this particular baron\u2019s son has got all manner of weight, and he\u2019s not afraid to throw it around.\u201d\n\u201cTo be completely fair,\u201d Stanchion said, \u201cit should be mentioned that young Kvothe is not the savviest socialite in the Commonwealth.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cAs evidenced by tonight\u2019s performance.\u201d\n\u201cI hate it when people call me young Kvothe,\u201d I said in an aside to Sim. He gave me a sympathetic look.\n\u201cI still say it was brilliant,\u201d Marie said, turning to face Stanchion, planting her feet solidly on the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s the cleverest thing anyone\u2019s done here in a month, and you know it.\u201d\nI lay my hand on Marie\u2019s arm. \u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d I said. \u201cIt was stupid.\u201d I made a vacillating shrug. \u201cOr at least it would be if I still had the slightest hope of getting a patron.\u201d I looked Stanchion in the eye. \u201cBut I don\u2019t. We both know Ambrose has poisoned that well for me.\u201d\n\u201cWells don\u2019t stay poisoned forever,\u201d Stanchion said.\nI shrugged. \u201cHow about this then? I\u2019d prefer to play songs that amuse my friends, rather than cater to folk who dislike me based on hearsay.\u201d\nStanchion drew a breath, then let it out in a rush. \u201cFair enough,\u201d he said, smiling a bit.\nIn the brief lull that followed, Manet cleared his throat meaningfully and darted his eyes around the table.\nI took his hint and made a round of introductions. \u201cStanchion, you\u2019ve already met my fellow students Wil and Sim. This is Manet, student and my sometimes mentor at the University. Everyone, this is Stanchion: host, owner, and master of the Eolian\u2019s stage.\u201d\n\u201cPleasure to meet you,\u201d Stanchion said, giving a polite nod before looking anxiously around the room. \u201cSpeaking of hosting, I should be about my business.\u201d He patted me on the back as he turned to leave. \u201cI\u2019ll see if I can put out a few fires while I\u2019m at it.\u201d\nI smiled my thanks to him, then made a flourishing gesture. \u201cEveryone,", "this is Marie. As you\u2019ve already heard with your own ears, the Eolian\u2019s finest fiddler. As you can see with your own eyes, the most beautiful woman in a thousand miles. As your wit discerns, the wisest of . . .\u201d\nGrinning, she swatted at me. \u201cIf I were half as wise as I am tall, I wouldn\u2019t be stepping in to defend you,\u201d she said. \u201cHas poor Threpe really been out stumping for you all this while?\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cI told him it was a lost cause.\u201d\n\u201cIt is if you keep thumbing your nose at folk,\u201d she said. \u201cI swear I\u2019ve never met a man who has your knack for lack of social grace. If you weren\u2019t naturally charming, someone would have stabbed you by now.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re assuming,\u201d I muttered.\nMarie turned to my friends at the table. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet all of you.\u201d Wil nodded, and Sim smiled. Manet, however, came to his feet in a smooth\nmotion and held out his hand. Marie took it, and Manet clasped it warmly between his own.\n\u201cMarie,\u201d he said. \u201cYou intrigue me. Is there any chance I could buy you a drink and enjoy the pleasure of your conversation at some point tonight?\u201d\nI was too startled to do anything but stare. Standing there, the two of them looked like badly matched bookends. Marie stood six inches taller than Manet, her boots making her long legs look even longer.\nManet, on the other hand, looked as he always did, grizzled and disheveled, plus older than Marie by at least a decade.\nMarie blinked and cocked her head a bit, as if considering. \u201cI\u2019m here with some friends right now,\u201d she said. \u201cIt might be late by the time I finish up with them.\u201d\n\u201cWhen makes no difference to me,\u201d Manet said easily. \u201cI\u2019m willing to lose some sleep if it comes to that. I can\u2019t think of the last time I shared the company of a woman who speaks her mind firmly and without hesitation. Your kind are in short supply these days.\u201d\nMarie looked him over again.\nManet met her eye and flashed a smile so confident and charming that it belonged on stage. \u201cI\u2019ve no desire to pull you away from your friends,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you\u2019re the first fiddler in ten years that\u2019s set my feet dancing. It seems a drink is the least I can do.\u201d\nMarie smiled back at him, half amused, half wry. \u201cI\u2019m on the second tier right now,\u201d she said, gesturing toward the stairway. \u201cBut I should be free in, say, two hours. . . .\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re terribly kind,\u201d he said. \u201cShould I come and find you?\u201d\n\u201cYou should,\u201d she said. Then gave him a thoughtful look as she turned to walk away.\nManet reclaimed his seat and took a drink.\nSimmon looked as flabbergasted as we all felt. \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d he demanded.\nManet chuckled into his beard and leaned back in his chair, cradling his mug to his chest. \u201cThat,\u201d he said smugly, \u201cis just one more thing I understand that you pups don\u2019t. Take note. Take heed.\u201d\nWhen members of the nobility want to show a musician their appreciation, they give money. When I first began playing in the Eolian, I\u2019d received a few such gifts, and for a time it had been enough to help pay my tuition and keep my head above water, if only barely. But Ambrose had been persistent in his campaign against me, and it had been months since I had received anything of the sort.\nMusicians are poorer than the gentry, but they still enjoy a show. So when they appreciate your playing, they buy you drinks. That was the real reason I was at the Eolian tonight.\nManet wandered off to fetch a wet rag from the bar so we could clean the table and play another round of corners. Before he could make it back, a young Cealdish piper came over to ask if there was any chance he could stand us a round.\nThere was a chance, as it turned out. He caught the eye of a nearby serving girl and we each ordered what we liked best, and a beer for Manet besides. We drank, played cards, and listened to music. Manet and I had a run of\nbad cards and went down three hands in a row. It soured my mood a bit, but not nearly as much as the sneaking suspicion that Stanchion might be right about what he\u2019d said.\nA rich patron would solve many of my problems. Even a poor patron would be able to give me a little room to breathe, financially speaking. If nothing else, it would give me someone I could borrow money from in a tight spot, rather than being forced into dealing with dangerous folk.\nWhile my mind was occupied, I misplayed and we lost another hand,\n \nputting us down four in a row with a forfeit besides.\nManet glared at me while he gathered in the cards. \u201cHere\u2019s a primer for\nadmissions.\u201d He held up his hand, three fingers spearing angrily into the air. \u201cLet\u2019s say you have three spades in your hand, and there have been five spades laid down.\u201d He held up his other hand, fingers splayed wide. \u201cHow many spades is that, total?\u201d He leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms. \u201cTake your time.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s still reeling from the knowledge that Marie is willing to have a drink with you,\u201d Wilem said dryly. \u201cWe all are.\u201d\n\u201cNot me,\u201d Simmon chirped. \u201cI knew you had it in you.\u201d\nWe were interrupted by the arrival of Lily, one of the regular serving girls at the Eolian. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d she said playfully. \u201cIs someone throwing a handsome party?\u201d\n\u201cLily,\u201d Simmon asked, \u201cIf I asked you to have a drink with me, would you consider it?\u201d\n\u201cI would,\u201d she said easily. \u201cBut not for very long.\u201d She laid her hand on his shoulder. \u201cYou gents are in luck. An anonymous admirer of fine music has offered to stand your table a round of drinks.\u201d\n\u201cScutten for me,\u201d Wilem said.\n\u201cMead,\u201d Simmon said, grinning.\n\u201cI\u2019ll have a sounten,\u201d I said.\nManet raised an eyebrow. \u201cA sounten, eh?\u201d he asked, glancing at me. \u201cI\u2019ll\nhave one too.\u201d He gave the serving girl a knowing look and nodded toward me. \u201cOn his, of course.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Lily said, then shrugged. \u201cBack in a shake.\u201d\n\u201cNow that you\u2019ve impressed the hell out of everyone you can have some fun, right?\u201d Simmon asked. \u201cSomething about a donkey. . .?\u201d\n\u201cFor the last time no,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m done with Ambrose. There\u2019s no percentage in antagonizing him any further.\u201d\n\u201cYou broke his arm,\u201d Wil said. \u201cI think he\u2019s as antagonized as he\u2019s going to get.\u201d\n\u201cHe broke my lute,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019re even. I\u2019m ready to let bygones be bygones.\u201d\n\u201cLike hell,\u201d Sim said. \u201cYou dropped that pound of rancid butter down his chimney. You loosened the cinch on his saddle. . . .\u201d\n\u201cBlack hands, shut up!\u201d I said, looking around. \u201cThat was nearly a month ago, and no one knows it was me except for you two. And now Manet. And", "everyone within earshot.\u201d\nSim flushed an embarrassed red and the conversation lulled until Lily\nreturned with our drinks. Wil\u2019s scutten was in its traditional stone cup. Sim\u2019s mead shone golden in a tall glass. Manet and I got wooden mugs.\nManet smiled. \u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time I ordered a sounten,\u201d he mused. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever ordered one for myself before.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the only other person I\u2019ve ever known to drink it,\u201d Sim said. \u201cKvothe here throws them back like nobody\u2019s business. Three or four a night.\u201d\nManet raised a bushy eyebrow at me. \u201cThey don\u2019t know?\u201d he asked.\nI shook my head as I drank out of my own mug, not sure if I should be amused or embarrassed.\nManet slid his mug toward Simmon, who picked it up and took a sip. He frowned and took another. \u201cWater?\u201d\nManet nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s an old whore\u2019s trick. You\u2019re chatting them up in the taproom of the brothel, and you want to show you\u2019re not like all the rest. You\u2019re a man of refinement. So you offer to buy a drink.\u201d\nHe reached across the table and took his mug back from Sim. \u201cBut they\u2019re working. They don\u2019t want a drink. They\u2019d rather have the money. So they order a sounten or a peveret or something else. You pay your money, the barman gives her water, and at the end of the night she splits the money with the house. If she\u2019s a good listener a girl can make as much at the bar as she does in bed.\u201d\nI chimed in. \u201cActually, we split it three ways. A third to the house, a third to the barman, and a third to me.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting screwed, then,\u201d Manet said frankly. \u201cThe barman should get his piece from the house.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you order a sounten at Anker\u2019s,\u201d Sim said.\n\u201cIt must be the Greysdale mead,\u201d Wil said. \u201cYou order that all the time.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019ve ordered Greysdale,\u201d Sim protested. \u201cIt tasted like sweet pickles\nand piss. Besides . . .\u201d Sim trailed off.\n\u201cIt was more expensive than you thought it would be?\u201d Manet asked,\ngrinning. \u201cWouldn\u2019t make much sense to go through all of this for the price of a short beer, would it?\u201d\n\u201cThey know what I mean when I order Greysdale at Anker\u2019s,\u201d I told him. \u201cIf I ordered something that didn\u2019t actually exist, it would be a pretty easy game to figure out.\u201d", "\u201cHow do you know about this?\u201d Sim asked Manet.\nManet chuckled. \u201cNo new tricks to an old dog like me,\u201d he said. The lights began to dim and we turned toward the stage.\nThe night rambled on from there. Manet left for greener pastures, while Wil, Sim, and I and did our best to keep our table clear of glasses while amused musicians bought us round after round of drinks. An obscene amount of drinks, really. Far more than I\u2019d dared to hope for.\nI drank sounten for the most part, since raising money to cover tuition was the main reason I\u2019d come to the Eolian tonight. Wil and Sim ordered a few rounds too, now that they knew the trick of it. I was doubly grateful, otherwise I would have been forced to bring them home in a wheelbarrow.\nEventually the three of us had our fill of music, gossip, and in Sim\u2019s case, the fruitless pursuit of serving girls.\nBefore we left, I stopped to have a discreet word with the barman where I brought up the difference between a half and a third. At the end of our negotiation, I cashed out for a full talent and six jots. The vast majority of that was from the drinks my fellow musicians had bought me tonight.\nI gathered the coins into my purse: Three talents even.\nMy negotiations had also profited me two dark brown bottles. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Sim asked as I began to tuck the bottles into my lute case.\n\u201cBredon beer.\u201d I shifted the rags I used to pad my lute so they wouldn\u2019t rub against it.\n\u201cBredon,\u201d Wil said, his voice thick with disdain, \u201cis closer to bread than beer.\u201d\nSim nodded in agreement, making a face. \u201cI don\u2019t like having to chew my liquor.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad,\u201d I said defensively. \u201cIn the small kingdoms women drink it when they\u2019re pregnant. Arwyl mentioned it in one of his lectures. They brew it with flower pollen and fish oil and cherry stones. It has all sorts of trace nutrients.\u201d\n\u201cKvothe, we don\u2019t judge you.\u201d Wilem lay his hand on my shoulder, his face concerned. \u201cSim and I don\u2019t mind that you\u2019re a pregnant Yllish woman.\u201d\nSimmon snorted, then laughed at the fact that he had snorted.\n \nThe three of us made our slow way back to the University, crossing the high arch of Stonebridge. And, since there was nobody around to hear, I sang \u201cJackass, Jackass\u201d for Sim.\nWil and Sim stumbled gently off to their rooms in Mews. But I wasn\u2019t ready for bed and continued wandering the University\u2019s empty streets, breathing the cool night air.\nI strolled past the dark fronts of apothecaries, glassblowers, and bookbinders. I cut through a manicured lawn, smelling the clean, dusty smell of autumn leaves and green grass beneath. Nearly all the inns and drinking houses were dark, but lights were burning in the brothels.\nThe grey stone of the Masters\u2019 Hall was silvery in the moonlight. A single dim light burned inside, illuminating the stained glass window that showed Teccam in his classic pose: barefoot at the mouth of his cave, speaking to a crowd of young students.\nI went past the Crucible, its countless bristling chimneys dark and largely smokeless against the moonlit sky. Even at night it smelled of ammonia and charred flowers, acid and alcohol: a thousand mingled scents that had seeped into the stone of the building over the centuries.\nLast was the Archives. Five stories tall and windowless, it reminded me of an enormous waystone. Its massive doors were closed, but I could see the reddish light of sympathy lamps welling up around the edges of the door. During admissions Master Lorren kept the Archives open at night so all the members of the Arcanum could study to their hearts\u2019 content. All members except one, of course.\nI made my way back to Anker\u2019s and found the inn dark and silent. I had a key to the back door, but rather than stumble through the dark, I headed into the nearby alley. Right foot rainbarrel, left foot window ledge, left hand iron drainpipe. I quietly made my way up to my third-story window, tripped the latch with a piece of wire, and let myself in.\nIt was pitch black, and I was too tired to go looking for a light from the fireplace downstairs. So I touched the wick of the lamp beside my bed, getting a little oil on my fingers. Then I murmured a binding and felt my arm go chilly as the heat bled out of it. Nothing happened at first, and I scowled, concentrating to overcome the vague haze of alcohol. The chill sunk deeper into my arm, making me shiver, but finally the wick bloomed into light.\nCold now, I closed the window and looked around the tiny room with its sloped ceiling and narrow bed. Surprisingly, I realized there was nowhere", "else in the four corners I\u2019d rather be. I almost felt as if I were home. This may not seem odd to you, but it was strange to me. Growing up\namong the Edema Ruh, home was never a place for me. Home was a group of wagons and songs around a campfire. When my troupe was killed, it was more than the loss of my family and childhood friends. It was like my entire world had been burned down to the waterline.\nNow, after almost a year at the University, I was beginning to feel like I belonged here. It was an odd feeling, this fondness for a place. In some ways it was comforting, but the Ruh in me was restless, rebelling at the thought of putting down roots like a plant.\nAs I drifted off to sleep, I wondered what my father would think of me.", ""], "CHAPTER SEVEN": ["CHAPTER SEVEN\nAdmissions\nTHE NEXT MORNING I splashed some water on my face and trudged downstairs. The taproom of Anker\u2019s was just starting to fill with people looking for an early lunch, and a few particularly disconsolate students were getting an early start on the day\u2019s drinking.\nStill bleary from lack of sleep, I settled into my usual corner table and began to fret about my upcoming interview.\nKilvin and Elxa Dal didn\u2019t worry me. I was ready for their questions. The same was largely true of Arwyl. But the other masters were all varying degrees of mystery to me.\nEvery term each master put a selection of books on display in Tomes, the reading room in the Archives. There were basic texts for the low-ranking E\u2019lir to study from, with progressively more advanced works for Re\u2019lar and El\u2019the. Those books revealed what the masters considered valuable knowledge. Those were the books a clever student studied before admissions.\nBut I couldn\u2019t wander into Tomes like everyone else. I was the only student who had been banned from the Archives in a dozen years, and everyone knew about it. Tomes was the only well-lit room in the whole building, and during admissions there were always people there, reading.\nSo I was forced to find copies of the masters\u2019 texts buried in the Stacks. You\u2019d be amazed how many versions of the same book there can be. If I was lucky, the volume I found was identical to the one the master had set aside in Tomes. More often, the versions I found were outdated, expurgated, or badly translated.\nI\u2019d done as much reading as possible over the last few nights, but hunting down the books took precious time, and I was still woefully underprepared.\nI was lost in these anxious thoughts when Anker\u2019s voice caught my attention. \u201cActually, that\u2019s Kvothe right over there,\u201d he said.\nI looked up to see a woman sitting at the bar. She wasn\u2019t dressed like a student. She wore an elaborate burgundy dress with long skirts, a tight waist,", "and matching burgundy gloves that rose all the way to her elbows. Moving deliberately, she managed to get down off the stool without tangling her feet and made her way over to stand next to my table. Her\nblonde hair was artfully curled, and her lips were a deeply painted red. I couldn\u2019t help wondering what she was doing in a place like Anker\u2019s.\n\u201cAre you the one who broke the arm of that brat Ambrose Jakis?\u201d she asked. She spoke Aturan with a thick, musical Modegan accent. While it made her a little difficult to understand, I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t find it attractive. The Modegan accent practically sweats sex.\n\u201cI did,\u201d I said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t entirely on purpose. But I did.\u201d\n\u201cThen you must let me buy you a drink,\u201d she said in the tone of a woman who usually gets her way.\nI smiled at her, wishing I\u2019d been awake more than ten minutes so my wits weren\u2019t quite so fuddled. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be the first to buy me one on that account,\u201d I said honestly. \u201cIf you insist, I\u2019ll have a Greysdale mead.\u201d\nI watched her turn and walk back to the bar. If she was a student, she was new. If she\u2019d been here more than a handful of days I would have heard about it from Sim, who kept tabs on all the prettiest girls in town, courting them with artless enthusiasm.\nThe Modegan woman returned a moment later and sat across from me, sliding a wooden mug across the table. Anker must have just finished washing it, as the fingers of her burgundy glove were wet where they had gripped the handle.\nShe raised her own glass, filled with a deep red wine. \u201cTo Ambrose Jakis,\u201d she said with sudden fierceness. \u201cMay he fall into a well and die.\u201d\nI picked up the mug and took a drink, wondering if there was a woman within fifty miles of the University Ambrose hadn\u2019t treated badly. I wiped my hand discreetly on my pants.\nThe woman took a deep drink of her wine and set her glass down hard. Her pupils were huge. Early as it was, she must have already been doing a fair piece of drinking.\nI could suddenly smell nutmeg and plum. I sniffed at my mug, then looked at the tabletop, thinking someone might have spilled a drink. But there was nothing.\nThe woman across from me suddenly burst into tears. This was no gentle weeping, either. It was like someone had turned a spigot.\nShe looked down at her gloved hands and shook her head. She peeled off", "the wet one, looked at me, and sobbed out a dozen words of Modegan.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said helplessly. \u201cI don\u2019t speak\u2014\u201d\nBut she was already pushing herself up and away from the table. Wiping at\nher face, she ran for the door.\nAnker stared at me from behind the bar, as did everyone else in the room. \u201cThat was not my fault,\u201d I said, pointing at the door. \u201cShe went crazy on\nher own.\u201d\nI would have followed her and tried to unravel it all, but she was already\noutside, and my admissions interview was less than an hour away. Besides, if I tried to help every woman Ambrose had ever traumatized, I wouldn\u2019t have time left for eating or sleeping.\nOn the upside, the bizarre encounter seemed to have cleared my head, and I no longer felt gritty and thick with lack of sleep. I decided I might as well take advantage of it and get admissions out of the way. Sooner begun is sooner done, as my father used to say.\nOn my way to Hollows, I stopped to buy a golden brown meat pie from a vender\u2019s cart. I knew I\u2019d need every penny for this term\u2019s tuition, but the price of a decent meal wasn\u2019t going to make much difference one way or the other. It was hot and solid, full of chicken and carrot and sage. I ate it while I walked, reveling in the small freedom of buying something according to my taste rather than making do with whatever Anker happened to have at hand.\nAs I finished the last bit of crust, I smelled honeyed almonds. I bought a large scoop in a clever pouch made from a dried corn husk. It cost me four drabs, but I hadn\u2019t had honeyed almonds in years, and some sugar in my blood wouldn\u2019t hurt when I was answering questions.\nThe line for admissions wound through the courtyard. Not abnormally long, but irritating nonetheless. I saw a familiar face from the Fishery and went to stand next to a young, green-eyed woman who was waiting to queue up as well.\n\u201cHello there,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re Amlia, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nShe gave me a nervous smile and a nod.\n\u201cI\u2019m Kvothe,\u201d I said, making a tiny bow.\n\u201cI know who you are,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you in the Artificery.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou should call it the Fishery,\u201d I said. I held out the pouch. \u201cWould you like a honey almond?\u201d\nAmlia shook her head.\n\u201cThey\u2019re really good,\u201d I said, joggling them enticingly in the corn-husk pouch.\nShe reached out hesitantly and took one.\n\u201cIs this the line for noon?\u201d I asked, gesturing.\nShe shook her head. \u201cWe\u2019ve got another couple minutes before we can\neven line up.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that they make us stand around like this,\u201d I said.\u201cLike\nsheep in a paddock. This entire process is a waste of everyone\u2019s time and insulting to boot.\u201d I saw a flicker of anxiety cross Amlia\u2019s face. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked her.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that you\u2019re talking a little loudly,\u201d she said, looking around.\n\u201cI\u2019m just not afraid to say what everybody else is thinking,\u201d I said. \u201cThe whole admissions process is flawed to the point of blinding idiocy. Master Kilvin knows what I\u2019m capable of. So does Elxa Dal. Brandeur doesn\u2019t know me from a hole in the ground. Why should he get an equal say in my tuition?\u201d\nAmlia shrugged, not meeting my eye.\nI bit into another almond and quickly spit it onto the cobblestones. \u201cFeah!\u201d I held them out to her. \u201cDo these taste like plums to you?\u201d\nShe gave me a vaguely disgusted look, then her eyes focused on something behind me.\nI turned to see Ambrose moving through the courtyard towards us. He cut a fine figure, as he always did, dressed in clean white linen, velvet, and brocade. He wore a hat with a tall white plume, and the sight of it made me unreasonably angry. Uncharacteristically, he was alone, devoid of his usual contingent of toadies and bootlickers.\n\u201cWonderful,\u201d I said as soon as he came within earshot. \u201cAmbrose, your presence is the horseshit frosting on the horseshit cake that is the admissions interview process.\u201d\nSurprisingly, Ambrose smiled at this. \u201cAh, Kvothe. I\u2019m pleased to see you too.\u201d\n\u201cI met one of your previous ladyloves today,\u201d I said. \u201cShe was dealing with the sort of profound emotional trauma I assume comes from seeing you naked.\u201d\nHis expression soured a little at that, and I leaned over and spoke to Amlia", "in a stage whisper. \u201cI have it on good report that not only does Ambrose have a tiny, tiny penis, but he can only become aroused when in the presence of a dead dog, a painting of the Duke of Gibea, and a shirtless galley drummer.\u201d\nAmlia\u2019s expression was frozen.\nAmbrose looked at her. \u201cYou should leave,\u201d he said gently. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason you should have to listen to this sort of thing.\u201d\nAmlia practically fled.\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you that,\u201d I said, watching her go. \u201cNobody can make a woman run like you.\u201d I tipped an imaginary hat. \u201cYou could give lessons. You could teach a class.\u201d\nAmbrose just stood, nodding contentedly and watching me in an oddly proprietary way.\n\u201cThat hat makes you look like you fancy young boys,\u201d I added. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve a mind to slap it right off your head if you don\u2019t piss off.\u201d I looked at him. \u201cSpeaking of which, how\u2019s the arm?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s feeling a great deal better at the moment,\u201d he said pleasantly. He rubbed at it absentmindedly as he stood there, smiling.\nI popped another almond into my mouth, then grimaced and spit it out again.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Ambrose asked. \u201cDon\u2019t fancy plum?\u201d Then, without waiting for an answer, he turned and walked away. He was smiling.\nIt says a great deal for my state of mind that I simply watched him go, confused. I lifted the pouch to my nose and took a deep breath. I smelled the dusty smell of the corn husk, honey, and cinnamon. Nothing at all of plum or nutmeg. How could Ambrose possibly know. . .?\nThen everything came crashing together in my head. At the same time, noon bell rang out and everyone with a tile similar to mine moved to join the long line winding through the courtyard. It was time for my admissions exam.\nI left the courtyard at a dead run.\nI pounded frantically on the door, out of breath from running up to the third floor of Mews. \u201cSimmon!\u201d I shouted. \u201cOpen this door and talk to me!\u201d\nAlong the hallway doors opened and students peered out at the commotion.\n \nOne of the heads peering out was Simmon\u2019s, his sandy hair in disarray. \u201cKvothe?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat are you doing? That\u2019s not even my door.\u201d\nI walked over, pushed him inside his room, and closed the door behind us. \u201cSimmon. Ambrose drugged me. I think there\u2019s something not right in my head, but I can\u2019t tell what it is.\u201d\nSimmon grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve thought that for a . . .\u201d He trailed off, his expression turning incredulous. \u201cWhat are you doing? Don\u2019t spit on my floor!\u201d\n\u201cI have a strange taste in my mouth,\u201d I explained.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he said, angry and confused. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Were you born in a barn?\u201d\nI struck him hard across the face with the flat of my hand, sending him staggering up against the wall. \u201cI was born in a barn, actually,\u201d I said grimly. \u201cIs there something wrong with that?\u201d\nSim stood with one hand braced against the wall, the other against the reddening skin of his cheek. His expression pure astonishment. \u201cWhat in God\u2019s name is wrong with you?\u201d\n\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong with me,\u201d I said, \u201cbut you\u2019d do well to watch your tone. I like you well enough, but just because I don\u2019t have a set of rich parents doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re one whit better than me.\u201d I frowned and spit again. \u201cGod that\u2019s foul, I hate nutmeg. I have ever since I was a child.\u201d\nA sudden realization washed over Sim\u2019s face. \u201cThe taste in your mouth,\u201d he said. \u201cIs it like plums and spice?\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting.\u201d\n\u201cGod\u2019s grey ashes,\u201d Sim said, his voice hushed in grim earnest. \u201cOkay. You\u2019re right. You\u2019ve been drugged. I know what it is.\u201d He trailed off as I turned around and started to open the door. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go kill Ambrose,\u201d I said. \u201cFor poisoning me.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a poison. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d He stopped speaking abruptly, then continued in a calm, level voice. \u201cWhere did you get that knife?\u201d\n\u201cI keep it strapped to my leg, under my pants,\u201d I said. \u201cFor emergencies.\u201d\nSim drew a deep breath, then let it out. \u201cCould you give me a minute to explain before you go kill Ambrose?\u201d\nI shrugged. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u201cWould you mind sitting down while we talk?\u201d He gestured to a chair.\nI sighed and sat down. \u201cFine. But hurry. I\u2019ve got admissions soon.\u201d\nSim nodded calmly and sat on the edge of his bed, facing me. \u201cOkay, you\nknow when someone\u2019s been drinking, and they get it into their head to do", "something stupid? And you can\u2019t talk them out of it even though it\u2019s obviously a bad idea?\u201d\nI laughed. \u201cLike when you wanted to go talk to that harper girl outside the Eolian and threw up on her horse?\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cExactly like that. There\u2019s something an alchemist can make that does the same thing, but it\u2019s much more extreme.\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t feel drunk in the least. My head is clear as a bell.\u201d\nSim nodded again. \u201cIt\u2019s not like being drunk,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that one piece of it. It won\u2019t make you dizzy or tired. It just makes it easier for a person to do something stupid.\u201d\nI thought about it for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s it,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I want to do anything stupid.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s one way to tell,\u201d Sim said. \u201cCan you think of anything right now that seems like a bad idea?\u201d\nI thought for a moment, tapping the flat of the knife\u2019s blade idly against the edge of my boot.\n\u201cIt would be a bad idea to . . .\u201d I trailed off.\nI thought for a longer moment. Sim looked at me expectantly.\n\u201c. . . to jump off the roof?\u201d My voice curled up at the end, making it a sort\nof question.\nSim was quiet. He kept looking at me.\n\u201cI see the problem,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cI don\u2019t seem to have any behavioral\nfilters.\u201d\nSimmon gave a relieved smile and nodded encouragingly. \u201cThat\u2019s it\nexactly. All your inhibitions have been sliced off so cleanly you can\u2019t even tell they\u2019re gone. But everything else is the same. You\u2019re steady, articulate, and rational.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re patronizing me,\u201d I said, pointing at him with the knife. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d He blinked. \u201cFair enough. Can you think of a solution to the problem?\u201d \u201cOf course. I need some sort of behavioral touchstone. You\u2019re going to\nneed to be my compass because you still have your filters in place.\u201d\n\u201cI was thinking the same thing,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you\u2019ll trust me?\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cExcept when it comes to women. You\u2019re an idiot with women.\u201d\nI picked up a glass of water from a nearby table and rinsed my mouth out with it, spitting it onto the floor.\nSim gave a shaky smile. \u201cFair enough. First, you can\u2019t go kill Ambrose.\u201d", "I hesitated. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure. In fact, pretty much anything you think to do with that knife is going to be a bad idea. You should give it to me.\u201d\nI shrugged and flipped it over in my palm, handing him the makeshift leather grip.\nSim seemed surprised by this, but he took hold of the knife. \u201cMerciful Tehlu,\u201d he said with a profound sigh, setting the knife down on the bed. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cWas that an extreme case?\u201d I asked, rinsing my mouth out again. \u201cWe should probably have some sort of ranking system. Like a ten point scale.\u201d\n\u201cSpitting water onto my floor is a one,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cSorry.\u201d I put the cup back onto his desk.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said easily.\n\u201cIs one low or high?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cLow,\u201d he said. \u201cKilling Ambrose is a ten.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cMaybe an\neight.\u201d He shifted in his seat. \u201cOr a seven.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d I said. \u201cThat much? Okay then.\u201d I leaned forward in my seat.\n\u201cYou need to give me some tips for admissions. I\u2019ve got to get back into line before too long.\u201d\nSimmon shook his head firmly. \u201cNo. That\u2019s a really bad idea. Eight.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cReally,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a delicate social situation. A lot of things could go\nwrong.\u201d\n\u201cBut if\u2014\u201d\nSim let out a sigh, brushing his sandy hair out of his eyes. \u201cAm I your\ntouchstone or not? This is going to get tedious if I have to tell you everything three times before you listen.\u201d\nI thought about it for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re right, especially if I\u2019m about to do something potentially dangerous.\u201d I looked around. \u201cHow long is this going to last?\u201d\n\u201cNo more than eight hours.\u201d He opened his mouth to continue, then closed it.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.\nSim sighed. \u201cThere might be some side effects. It\u2019s lipid soluble, so it will hang around in your body a bit. You might experience occasional minor relapses brought about by stress, intense emotion, exercise. . . .\u201d He gave me an apologetic look. \u201cThey\u2019d be like little echoes of this.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll worry about that later,\u201d I said. I held out my hand. \u201cGive me your admissions tile. You can go through now. I\u2019ll take your slot.\u201d\nHe spread his hands helplessly. \u201cI\u2019ve already gone,\u201d he explained. \u201cTehlu\u2019s tits and teeth,\u201d I cursed. \u201cFine. Go get Fela.\u201d\nHe waved his hands violently in front of himself. \u201cNo. No no no. Ten.\u201d\nI laughed. \u201cNot for that. She has a slot late on Cendling.\u201d\n\u201cYou think she\u2019ll trade with you?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s already offered.\u201d\nSim got to his feet. \u201cI\u2019ll go find her.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll stay here,\u201d I said.\nSim gave an enthusiastic nod and looked nervously around the room. \u201cIt\u2019s\nprobably safest if you don\u2019t do anything while I\u2019m gone,\u201d he said as he opened the door. \u201cJust sit on your hands until I get back.\u201d\nSim was only gone for five minutes, which was probably for the best. There was a knock on the door. \u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d Sim\u2019s voice came through the\nwood. \u201cIs everything all right in there?\u201d\n\u201cYou know what\u2019s strange?\u201d I said to him through the door. \u201cI tried to\nthink of something funny I could do while you were gone, but I couldn\u2019t.\u201d I looked around at the room. \u201cI think that means humor is rooted in social transgression. I can\u2019t transgress because I can\u2019t figure out what would be socially unacceptable. Everything seems the same to me.\u201d\n\u201cYou might have a point,\u201d he said, then asked, \u201cdid you do something anyway?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cI decided to be good. Did you find Fela?\u201d\n\u201cI did. She\u2019s here. But before we come in, you have to promise not to do anything without asking me first. Fair?\u201d\nI laughed. \u201cFair enough. Just don\u2019t make me do stupid things in front of her.\u201d\n\u201cI promise,\u201d Sim said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit down? Just to be safe.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m already sitting,\u201d I said.\nSim opened the door. I could see Fela peering over his shoulder. \u201cHello Fela,\u201d I said. \u201cI need to trade slots with you.\u201d\n\u201cFirst,\u201d Sim said. \u201cYou should put your shirt back on. That\u2019s about a two.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cSorry. I was hot.\u201d\n\u201cYou could have opened the window.\u201d\n\u201cI thought it would be safer if I limited my interactions with external\nobjects,\u201d I said.\nSim raised an eyebrow. \u201cThat\u2019s actually a really good idea. It just steered\nyou a little wrong in this case.\u201d\n\u201cWow.\u201d I heard Fela\u2019s voice from the hallway. \u201cIs he serious?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely serious,\u201d Sim said. \u201cHonestly? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s safe for you to\ncome in.\u201d\nI tugged my shirt on. \u201cDressed,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll even sit on my hands if it will\nmake you feel better.\u201d I did just that, tucking them under my legs.\nSim let Fela inside, then closed the door behind her.\n\u201cFela, you are just gorgeous,\u201d I said. \u201cI would give you all the money in\nmy purse if I could just look at you naked for two minutes. I\u2019d give everything I own. Except my lute.\u201d\nIt\u2019s hard to say which of them blushed a deeper red. I think it was Sim.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t supposed to say that, was I?\u201d I said.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sim said. \u201cThat\u2019s about a five.\u201d\n\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d I said. \u201cWomen are naked in paintings.\nPeople buy paintings, don\u2019t they? Women pose for them.\u201d\nSim nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s true. But still. Just sit for a moment and don\u2019t say or\ndo anything? Okay?\u201d I nodded.\n\u201cI can\u2019t quite believe this,\u201d Fela said, the blush fading from her cheeks. \u201cI can\u2019t help but think the two of you are playing some sort of elaborate joke on me.\u201d\n\u201cI wish we were,\u201d Simmon said. \u201cThis stuff is terribly dangerous.\u201d\n\u201cHow can he remember naked paintings and not remember you\u2019re supposed to keep your shirt on in public?\u201d she asked Sim, her eyes never leaving me.\n\u201cIt just didn\u2019t seem very important,\u201d I said. \u201cI took my shirt off when I was whipped. That was public. It seems a strange thing to get in trouble for.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know what would happen if you tried to knife Ambrose?\u201d Simmon asked.\nI thought for a second. It was like trying to remember what you\u2019d eaten for breakfast a month ago. \u201cThere\u2019d be a trial, I suppose,\u201d I said slowly, \u201cand people would buy me drinks.\u201d", "Fela muffled a laugh behind her hand.\n\u201cHow about this?\u201d Simmon asked me. \u201cWhich is worse, stealing a pie or killing Ambrose?\u201d\nI gave it a moment\u2019s hard thought. \u201cA meat pie, or a fruit pie?\u201d\n\u201cWow,\u201d Fela said breathlessly. \u201cThat\u2019s . . .\u201d She shook her head. \u201cIt almost makes my skin crawl.\u201d\nSimmon nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrifying piece of alchemy. It\u2019s a variation of a sedative called a plum bob. You don\u2019t even have to ingest it. It\u2019s absorbed straight through the skin.\u201d\nFela looked at him. \u201cHow do you know so much about it?\u201d\nSim gave a weak smile. \u201cMandrag lectures about it in every alchemy class he teaches. I\u2019ve heard the story a dozen times by now. It\u2019s his favorite example of how alchemy can be abused. An alchemist used it to ruin the lives of several government officials in Atur about fifty years ago. He only got caught because a countess ran amok in the middle of a wedding, killed a dozen folk and\u2014\u201d\nSim stopped, shaking his head. \u201cAnyway. It was bad. Bad enough that the alchemist\u2019s mistress turned him over to the guards.\u201d\n\u201cI hope he got what he deserved.\u201d\n\u201cAnd with some to spare,\u201d Sim said grimly. \u201cThe point is, it hits everyone a little differently. It\u2019s not a simple lowering of inhibition. There\u2019s an amplification of emotion. A freeing up of hidden desire combined with a strange type of selective memory, almost like a moral amnesia.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel bad,\u201d I said. \u201cI feel pretty good, actually. But I\u2019m worried about admissions.\u201d\nSim gestured. \u201cSee? He remembers admissions. It\u2019s important to him. But other things are just . . . gone.\u201d\n\u201cIs there a cure?\u201d Fela asked nervously. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we take him to the Medica?\u201d\nSimmon looked nervous. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. They might try a purgative, but it\u2019s not as if there\u2019s a drug working through him. Alchemy doesn\u2019t work like that. He\u2019s under the influence of unbound principles. You can\u2019t flush those out the way you\u2019d try to get rid of mercury or ophalum.\u201d\n\u201cA purgative doesn\u2019t sound like much fun,\u201d I added. \u201cIf my vote counts for anything.\u201d\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s a chance they might think he\u2019s cracked under admission stress,\u201d Sim said to Fela. \u201cThat happens to a few students every term. They\u2019d", "stick him in Haven until they were sure\u2014\u201d\nI was on my feet, my hands clenched into fists. \u201cI\u2019ll be cut into pieces in\nhell before I let them stick me in Haven,\u201d I said, furious. \u201cEven for an hour. Even for a minute.\u201d\nSim blanched and took a step back, raising his hands defensively, palms out. But his voice was firm and calm. \u201cKvothe, I am telling you three times. Stop.\u201d\nI stopped. Fela was watching me with wide, frightened eyes.\nSimmon continued firmly. \u201cKvothe, I am telling you three times: sit down.\u201d\nI sat.\nStanding behind him, Fela looked at Simmon, surprised.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Simmon said graciously, lowering his hands. \u201cI agree. The\nMedica isn\u2019t the best place for you. We can just ride this out here.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds better to me too,\u201d I said.\n\u201cEven if things did go smoothly at the Medica,\u201d Simmon added. \u201cI expect\nyou will be more inclined to speak your mind than usual.\u201d He gave a small, wry smile. \u201cSecrets are the cornerstone of civilization, and I know you have a few more than most folk.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I have any secrets,\u201d I said.\nSim and Fela both burst out laughing at the same time. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you just proved his point,\u201d Fela said. \u201cI know you have at least a few.\u201d\n\u201cSo do I,\u201d Sim said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re my touchstone,\u201d I shrugged. Then I smiled at Fela and pulled out my purse.\nSim shook his head at me. \u201cNo no no. I\u2019ve already told you. Seeing her naked would be the worst thing in the world right now.\u201d\nFela\u2019s eyes narrowed a little at that.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d I asked. \u201cAre you worried I\u2019ll tackle her to the ground and ravage her?\u201d I laughed.\nSim looked at me. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d I said.\nHe looked at Fela, then back. \u201cCan you say why?\u201d he asked curiously.\nI thought about it. \u201cIt\u2019s because . . .\u201d I trailed off, then shook my head. \u201cIt\n...I just can\u2019t. I know I can\u2019t eat a stone or walk through a wall. It\u2019s like that.\u201d I concentrated on it for a second and began to get dizzy. I put one hand\nover my eyes and tried to ignore the sudden vertigo. \u201cPlease tell me I\u2019m right", "about that,\u201d I asked, suddenly scared. \u201cI can\u2019t eat a stone, can I?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Fela said quickly. \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d\nI stopped trying to rummage around the inside of my mind for answers and\nthe odd vertigo faded.\nSim was watching me intently.\u201cI wish I knew what that signified,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a fair idea,\u201d Fela murmured softly.\nI drew the ivory admissions tile out of my purse. \u201cI was just looking to\ntrade,\u201d I said. \u201cUnless you are willing to let me see you naked.\u201d I hefted the purse with my other hand and met Fela\u2019s eye. \u201cSim says it\u2019s wrong, but he\u2019s an idiot with women. My head might not be screwed on quite as tightly as I\u2019d like, but I remember that clearly.\u201d\nIt was four hours before my inhibitions began to filter back, and two more before they were firmly in place. Simmon spent the entire day with me, patient as a priest, explaining that no, I shouldn\u2019t go buy us a bottle of brand. No, I shouldn\u2019t go kick the dog that was barking across the street. No, I shouldn\u2019t go to Imre and look for Denna. No. Three times no.\nBy the time the sun went down I was back to my regular, semi-moral self. Simmon quizzed me extensively before walking me back to my room at Anker\u2019s, where he made me swear on my mother\u2019s milk that I wouldn\u2019t leave my room until morning. I swore.\nBut all was not right with me. My emotions were still running hot, flaring up at every little thing. Worse, my memory hadn\u2019t simply returned to normal, it was back with a vivid and uncontrollable enthusiasm.\nIt hadn\u2019t been that bad when I was with Simmon. His presence was a pleasant distraction. But alone in my small garret room in Anker\u2019s, I was at the mercy of my memory. It was as if my mind was determined to unpack and examine every sharp and painful thing I had ever seen.\nYou might think the worst memories were those of when my troupe was killed. Of how I came back to our camp and found everything aflame. The unnatural shapes my parents\u2019 bodies made in the dim twilight. The smell of scorched canvas and blood and burning hair. Memories of the ones who killed them. Of the Chandrian. Of the man who spoke to me, grinning all the while. Of Cinder.\n \nThese were bad memories, but over the years I had brought them out and handled them so often there was hardly a sharp edge left to them. I remembered the pitch and timbre of Haliax\u2019s voice as clearly as my father\u2019s. I could easily bring to mind the face of Cinder. His perfect, smiling teeth. His white, curling hair. His eyes, black as beads of ink. His voice, full of winter\u2019s chill, saying: Someone\u2019s parents have been singing entirely the wrong sorts of songs.\nYou would think these would be the worst memories. But you would be wrong.\nNo. The worst memories were those of my young life. The slow roll and bump of riding in the wagon, my father holding the reins loosely. His strong hands on my shoulders, showing me how to stand on the stage so my body said proud, or sad, or shy. His fingers adjusting mine on the strings of his lute.\nMy mother brushing my hair. The feel of her arms around me. The perfect way my head fit into the curve of her neck. How I would sit, curled in her lap next to the fire at night, drowsy and happy and safe.\nThese were the worst memories. Precious and perfect. Sharp as a mouthful of broken glass. I lay in bed, clenched into a trembling knot, unable to sleep, unable to turn my mind to other things, unable to stop myself from remembering. Again. And again. And again.\nThen there came a small tapping at my window. A sound so tiny I didn\u2019t notice it until it stopped. Then I heard the window ease open behind me.\n\u201cKvothe?\u201d Auri said softly.\nI clenched my teeth against the sobbing and lay still as I could, hoping she would think I was asleep and leave.\n\u201cKvothe?\u201d she called again. \u201cI brought you\u2014\u201d There was a moment of silence, then she said, \u201cOh.\u201d\nI heard a soft sound behind me. The moonlight showed her tiny shadow on the wall as she climbed through the window. I felt the bed move as she settled onto it.\nA small, cool hand brushed the side of my face.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cCome here.\u201d\nI began to cry quietly, and she gently uncurled the tight knot of me until\nmy head lay in her lap. She murmured, brushing my hair away from my forehead, her hands cool against my hot face.\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said sadly. \u201cIt\u2019s bad sometimes, isn\u2019t it?\u201d", "She stroked my hair gently, and it only made me cry harder. I could not remember the last time someone had touched me in a loving way.\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have a stone in your heart, and some days it\u2019s so heavy there is nothing to be done. But you don\u2019t have to be alone for it. You should have come to me. I understand.\u201d\nMy body clenched and suddenly the taste of plum filled my mouth again. \u201cI miss her,\u201d I said before I realized I was speaking. Then I bit it off before I could say anything else. I clenched my teeth and shook my head furiously, like a horse fighting its reins.\n\u201cYou can say it,\u201d Auri said gently.\nI shook again, tasted plum, and suddenly the words were pouring out of me. \u201cShe said I sang before I spoke. She said when I was just a baby she had the habit of humming when she held me. Nothing like a song. Just a descending third. Just a soothing sound. Then one day she was walking me around the camp, and she heard me echo it back to her. Two octaves higher. A tiny piping third. She said it was my first song. We sang it back and forth to each other. For years.\u201d I choked and clenched my teeth.\n\u201cYou can say it,\u201d Auri said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay if you say it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m never going to see her again,\u201d I choked out. Then I began to cry in earnest.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Auri said softly. \u201cI\u2019m here. You\u2019re safe.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER EIGHT": ["CHAPTER EIGHT\nQuestions\nTHE NEXT FEW DAYS were neither pleasant nor productive. Fela\u2019s admissions slot was at the very end of the span, so I attempted to put the extra time to good use. I tried to do some piecework in the Fishery, but quickly returned to my room when I broke down crying halfway through inscribing a heat funnel. Not only couldn\u2019t I maintain the proper Alar, but the last thing I needed was for people to think I\u2019d cracked under the stress of admissions.\nLater that night, when I tried to crawl through the narrow tunnel into the Archives, the taste of plum flooded my mouth, and I was filled with a mindless fear of the dark, confining space. Luckily, I\u2019d only gone a dozen feet, but even so I almost gave myself a concussion struggling backwards out of the tunnel, and my palms were scraped raw from my panicked scrabbling against the stone.\nSo I spent the next two days pretending I was sick and keeping to my tiny room. I played my lute, slept fitfully, and thought dark thoughts of Ambrose.\nAnker was cleaning up when I came downstairs. \u201cFeeling better?\u201d he asked. \u201cA bit,\u201d I said. Yesterday I\u2019d only had two plum echoes, and they were\nvery brief. Better yet, I\u2019d managed to sleep the whole night through. It seemed I was through the worst of it.\n\u201cYou hungry?\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cAdmissions today.\u201d\nAnker frowned. \u201cYou should have something, then. An apple.\u201d He bustled\naround behind the bar, then brought out a pottery mug and a heavy jug. \u201cHave some milk too. I\u2019ve got to make use of it before it turns. Damn iceless started giving up the ghost a couple days ago. Three talents solid that thing cost me. I knew I shouldn\u2019t have wasted money on it with ice so cheap\n \naround here.\u201d\nI leaned over the bar and peered at the long wooden box tucked away\namong the mugs and bottles. \u201cI could take a look at it for you,\u201d I offered. Anker raised an eyebrow. \u201cCan you do something with it?\u201d\n\u201cI can look,\u201d I said. \u201cCould be something simple I could fix.\u201d\nAnker shrugged. \u201cYou can\u2019t break it more than it\u2019s already broken.\u201d He\nwiped his hands on his apron and motioned me behind the bar. \u201cI\u2019ll do you a couple eggs while you\u2019re having your look. I should use those up too.\u201d He opened the long box, took out a handful of eggs, then walked back into the kitchen.\nI made my way around the corner of the bar and knelt to look at the iceless. It was a stone-lined box the size of a small traveling trunk. Anywhere other than the University it would have been a miracle of artificing, a luxury. Here, where such things were easy to come by, it was just another piece of needless God-bothering that wasn\u2019t working properly.\nIt was about as simple a piece of artificing as could be made. No moving parts at all, just two flat bands of tin covered in sygaldry that moved heat from one end of the metal band to the other. It was really nothing more than a slow, inefficient heat siphon.\nI crouched down and rested my fingers on the tin bands. The right-hand one was warm, meaning the half on the inside would be correspondingly cool. But the one on the left was room temperature. I craned my neck to get a look at the sygaldry and spotted a deep scratch in the tin, scoring through two of the runes.\nThat explained it. A piece of sygaldry is like a sentence in a lot of ways. If you remove a couple words, it simply doesn\u2019t make any sense. I should say it usually doesn\u2019t make sense. Sometimes a damaged piece of sygaldry can do something truly unpleasant. I frowned down at the band of tin. This was sloppy artificing. The runes should have been on the inside of the band where they couldn\u2019t be damaged.\nI rummaged around until I found a disused ice hammer in the back of a drawer, then carefully tapped the two damaged runes flat into the soft surface of the tin. Then I concentrated and used the tip of a paring knife to etch them back into the thick metal band.\nAnker emerged from the kitchen with a plateful of eggs and tomatoes. \u201cIt should work now,\u201d I said. I started eating out of politeness, then realized I was actually hungry.", "Anker looked over the box, lifting the lid. \u201cThat easy?\u201d\n\u201cSame as anything else,\u201d I said, my mouth half full. \u201cEasy if you know what you\u2019re doing. It should work. Give it a day and see if it actually chills down.\u201d\nI finished off the plateful of eggs and drank the milk as quickly as I could without being rude. \u201cI\u2019ll need to cash out my bar credit today,\u201d I said. \u201cTuition\u2019s going to be hard this term.\u201d\nAnker nodded and checked a small ledger he kept underneath the bar, tallying all the Greysdale mead I\u2019d pretended to drink over the last two months. Then he pulled out his purse and counted out ten copper jots onto the table. A full talent: twice what I\u2019d expected. I looked up at him, puzzled.\n\u201cOne of Kilvin\u2019s boys would have charged me at least half a talent to come round and fix this thing,\u201d Anker explained, kicking at the iceless.\n\u201cI can\u2019t be sure. . . .\u201d\nHe waved me into silence. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t fixed, I\u2019ll take it out of your wages over the next month,\u201d he said. \u201cOr I\u2019ll use it as leverage to get you to start playing Reaving night too.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI consider it an investment.\u201d\nI gathered the money into my purse: Four talents.\nI was heading toward the Fishery to see if my lamps had finally sold when I caught a glimpse of a familiar face crossing the courtyard wearing dark master\u2019s robes.\n\u201cMaster Elodin!\u201d I called as I saw him approaching a side door to the Masters\u2019 Hall. It was one of the few buildings I hadn\u2019t spent much time in, as it contained little more than living quarters for the masters, the resident gillers, and guest rooms for visiting arcanists.\nHe turned at the sound of his name. Then, seeing me jogging toward him, he rolled his eyes and turned back to the door.\n\u201cMaster Elodin,\u201d I said, breathing a little hard. \u201cMight I ask you a quick question?\u201d\n\u201cStatistically speaking, it\u2019s pretty likely,\u201d he said, unlocking the door with a bright brass key.\n\u201cMay I ask you a question, then?\u201d\n\u201cI doubt any power known to man could stop you.\u201d He swung open the\n \ndoor and headed inside.\nI hadn\u2019t been invited, but I slipped inside after him. Elodin was difficult to\ntrack down, and I worried if I didn\u2019t take this chance, I might not see him again for another span of days.\nI followed him through a narrow stone hallway. \u201cI\u2019d heard a rumor you were gathering a group of students to study naming,\u201d I said cautiously.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a question,\u201d Elodin said as he headed up a long, narrow flight of stairs.\nI fought back the urge to snap at him and took a deep breath instead. \u201cIs it true you\u2019re teaching such a class?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWere you planning on including me?\u201d\nElodin stopped and turned to face me on the stairway. He looked out of\nplace in his dark master\u2019s robe. His hair was tousled and his face was too young, almost boyish.\nHe stared at me for a long minute. He looked me up and down as if I were a horse he were thinking of betting on, or a side of beef he was considering selling by the pound.\nBut that was nothing compared to when he met my eyes. For a heartbeat it was simply unsettling. Then it almost felt like the light on the stairway grew dim. Or that I was suddenly being thrust deep underwater and the pressure was keeping me from drawing a full breath.\n\u201cDamn you, half-wit.\u201d I heard a familiar voice that seemed to be coming from a long way off. \u201cIf you\u2019re going catatonic again, have the decency to do it in Haven and save us the trouble of carting your foam-flecked carcass back there. Barring that, get to one side.\u201d\nElodin looked away from me and suddenly everything was bright and clear again. I fought to keep from gasping in a lungful of air.\nMaster Hemme stomped down the stairs, shouldering Elodin roughly to one side. When he saw me he snorted. \u201cOf course. The quarter-wit is here too. Might I recommend a book for your perusal? It is a lovely piece of reading titled, Hallways, Their Form and Function: A Primer for the Mentally Deficient.\u201d\nHe glowered at me, and when I didn\u2019t immediately jump aside he gave me an unpleasant smile. \u201cAh, but you\u2019re still banned from the Archives, aren\u2019t you? Should I arrange to present the salient information in a form more suited to your kind? Perhaps a mummer\u2019s play or some manner of puppet show?\u201d", "I stepped to one side and Hemme stormed by, muttering to himself. Elodin stared daggers into the other master\u2019s broad back. Only after Hemme turned the corner did Elodin\u2019s attention settle back on me.\nHe sighed. \u201cPerhaps it would be better if you pursued your other studies, Re\u2019lar Kvothe. Dal has a fondness for you, as does Kilvin. You seem to be progressing well with them.\u201d\n\u201cBut sir,\u201d I said, trying to keep the dismay out of my voice. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who sponsored my promotion to Re\u2019lar.\u201d\nHe turned and began climbing the stairs again. \u201cThen you should value my sage advice, shouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cBut, if you\u2019re teaching other students, why not me?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you are too eager to be properly patient,\u201d he said flippantly. \u201cYou\u2019re too proud to listen properly. And you\u2019re too clever by half. That\u2019s the worst of it.\u201d\n\u201cSome masters prefer clever students,\u201d I muttered as we emerged into a wide hallway.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Elodin said. \u201cDal and Kilvin and Arwyl like clever students. Go study with one of them. Both our lives will be considerably easier because of it.\u201d\n\u201cBut . . .\u201d\nElodin came to an abrupt halt in the middle of the hallway. \u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cProve you\u2019re worth teaching. Shake my assumptions down to their foundation stones.\u201d He patted at his robes dramatically, as if looking for something lost in a pocket. \u201cMuch to my dismay, I find myself without a way to get past this door.\u201d He rapped it with a knuckle. \u201cWhat do you do in this situation, Re\u2019lar Kvothe?\u201d\nI smiled despite my general irritation. He couldn\u2019t have picked a challenge more perfectly suited to my talents. I pulled a long, slender piece of spring steel out of a pocket in my cloak, then knelt in front of the door and eyed the keyhole. The lock was substantial, made to last. But while large, heavy locks look impressive, they\u2019re actually easier to circumvent if they\u2019re well- maintained.\nThis one was. It took me the space of three slow breaths to trip it with a satisfying k-tick. I stood up, brushed off my knees, and swung the door inward with a flourish.\nFor his part, Elodin did seem somewhat impressed. His eyebrows went up as the door swung open. \u201cClever,\u201d he said as he walked inside.", "I followed on his heels. I\u2019d never really wondered what Elodin\u2019s rooms were like. But if I\u2019d guessed, it wouldn\u2019t have been anything resembling this.\nThey were huge and lavish, with high ceilings and thick rugs. Old wood paneled the walls, and tall windows let in the early morning light. There were oil paintings and massive pieces of ancient wooden furniture. It was bizarrely ordinary.\nElodin moved quickly through the entryway, through a tasteful sitting room, then into the bedroom. Call it a bedchamber, rather. It was huge, with a four-post bed big as a boat. Elodin threw open a wardrobe and started removing several long, dark robes similar to the one he was wearing.\n\u201cHere.\u201d Elodin shoved robes into my arms until I couldn\u2019t hold any more. Some were everyday cotton, but others were fine linen or rich, soft velvet. He lay another half-dozen robes over his own arm and carried them back into the sitting room.\nWe passed old bookshelves lined with hundreds of books and a huge polished desk. One wall was taken up with a large stone fireplace big enough to roast a pig, though there was currently only a small fire smoldering there, keeping away the early autumn chill.\nElodin lifted a crystal decanter off a table and went to stand in front of the fireplace. He dumped the robes he was carrying into my arms so I could barely see over the top of them. Delicately lifting the top off the decanter, he sipped at the contents and raised an eyebrow appreciatively, holding it up to the light.\nI decided to try again. \u201cMaster Elodin, why don\u2019t you want to teach me naming?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the wrong question,\u201d he said, and upended the decanter onto smoldering coals in the fireplace. As the flames licked up hungrily, he took his armload of robes back and fed a velvet one slowly into the fire. It caught quickly, and when it was blazing away, he fed the others onto the fire in quick succession. The result was a great smoldering pile of cloth that sent thick smoke billowing up the chimney. \u201cTry again.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t help but ask the obvious. \u201cWhy are you burning your clothes?\u201d\n\u201cNope. Not even close to the right question,\u201d he said as he took more robes out of my arms and piled them into the fireplace. Then Elodin grabbed the handle for the flue and pulled it closed with a metallic clank. Great clouds of smoke began to pour into the room. Elodin coughed a bit, then stepped back and looked around in a vaguely satisfied way.", "I suddenly realized what was going on. \u201cOh God,\u201d I said. \u201cWhose rooms are these?\u201d\nElodin gave a satisfied nod. \u201cVery good. I would also have accepted, Why don\u2019t you have a key for this room? or What are we doing in here?\u201d He looked down at me, his eyes serious. \u201cDoors are locked for a reason. People who don\u2019t have keys are supposed to stay out for a reason.\u201d\nHe nudged the heap of smouldering cloth with one foot, as if reassuring himself it would stay in the fireplace. \u201cYou know you\u2019re clever. That\u2019s your weakness. You assume you know what you\u2019re getting into, but you don\u2019t.\u201d\nElodin turned to look at me, his dark eyes serious. \u201cYou think you can trust me to teach you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou think I will keep you safe. But that is the worst sort of foolishness.\u201d\n\u201cWhose rooms are these?\u201d I repeated numbly.\nHe showed me all his teeth in a sudden grin. \u201cMaster Hemme\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you burning all of Hemme\u2019s clothes?\u201d I asked, trying to ignore\nthe fact that the room was rapidly filling with bitter smoke.\nElodin looked at me as if I were an idiot. \u201cBecause I hate him.\u201d He picked\nup the crystal decanter from the mantle and threw it violently against the back of the fireplace where it shattered. The fire began to burn more vigorously from whatever had been left inside. \u201cThe man is an absolute tit. Nobody talks to me like that.\u201d\nSmoke continued to boil into the room. If it weren\u2019t for the high ceilings we\u2019d already be choking on it. Even so, it was becoming hard to breathe as we made our way to the door. Elodin opened it, and smoke rolled out into the hallway.\nWe stood outside the door, staring at each other while the smoke billowed past. I decided to take a different tack on the problem. \u201cI understand your hesitation, Master Elodin,\u201d I said. \u201cSometimes I don\u2019t think things all the way through.\u201d\n\u201cObviously.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll admit there have been times when my actions have been . . .\u201d I paused, trying to think of something more humble than ill-considered.\n\u201cStupid beyond all mortal ken?\u201d Elodin said helpfully.\nMy temper flared, burning away my brief attempt at humility. \u201cWell thank God I\u2019m the only one here that\u2019s ever made a bad decision in my life!\u201d I said, barely keeping my voice this side of a shout. I looked him hard in the eye. \u201cI\u2019ve heard stories about you too, you know. They say you toffed things up", "pretty well yourself back when you were a student here.\u201d\nElodin\u2019s amused expression faded a bit, leaving him looking like he\u2019d\nswallowed something and it had gotten stuck halfway down.\nI continued. \u201cIf you think I\u2019m reckless, do something about it. Show me\nthe straighter path! Mold my supple young mind\u2014\u201d I sucked in a lungful of smoke and began to cough, forcing me to cut my tirade short. \u201cDo something, damn you!\u201d I choked out. \u201cTeach me!\u201d\nI hadn\u2019t really been shouting, but I ended up breathless all the same. My temper faded as quickly as it had flared up, and I worried I\u2019d gone too far.\nBut Elodin just looked at me. \u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m not teaching you?\u201d he asked, puzzled. \u201cAside from the fact that you refuse to learn.\u201d\nThen he turned and walked down the hallway. \u201cI\u2019d get out of here if I were you,\u201d he said over his shoulder. \u201cPeople are going to want to know who\u2019s responsible for this, and everyone knows you and Hemme don\u2019t get on very well.\u201d\nI felt myself break into a panicked sweat. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d wash up before admissions too,\u201d he said. \u201cIt won\u2019t look good if you show up reeking of smoke. I live here,\u201d Elodin said, pulling a key from his pocket and unlocking a door at the far end of the hallway. \u201cWhat\u2019s your excuse?\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER NINE": ["CHAPTER NINE\nA Civil Tongue\nMY HAIR WAS STILL wet when I made my way through a short hallway, then up the stairs onto the stage of an empty theater. As always, the room was dark except for the huge crescent-shaped table. I moved to the edge of the light and waited politely.\nThe Chancellor motioned me forward and I walked to the center of the table, reaching up to hand him my tile. Then I stepped back to stand in the circle of slightly brighter light between the two outthrust horns of the table.\nThe nine masters looked down at me. I\u2019d like to say they looked dramatic, like ravens on a fence or something like that. But while they were all wearing their formal robes, they were too mismatched to look like a collection of anything.\nWhat\u2019s more, I could see the marks of weariness on them. Only then did it occur to me that as much as the students hated admissions, it was probably no walk in the garden for the masters either.\n\u201cKvothe, Arliden\u2019s son,\u201d the Chancellor said formally. \u201cRe\u2019lar.\u201d He made a gesture to the far right-hand horn of the table. \u201cMaster Physicker?\u201d\nArwyl peered down at me, his face grandfatherly behind his round\nspectacles. \u201cWhat are the medicinal properties of mhenka?\u201d he asked. \u201cPowerful anesthetic,\u201d I said. \u201cPowerful catatoniate. Potential purgative.\u201d I\nhesitated. \u201cIt has a whole sackful of complicating secondaries too. Should I list them all?\u201d\nArwyl shook his head. \u201cA patient comes into the Medica complaining of pains in their joints and difficulty breathing. Their mouth is dry, and they claim to have a sweet taste in their mouth. They complain of chills, but they are actually sweaty and feverish. What is your diagnosis?\u201d\nI drew a breath, then hesitated. \u201cI don\u2019t make diagnoses in the Medica, Master Arwyl. I\u2019d fetch one of your El\u2019the to do it.\u201d\nHe smiled at me, eyes crinkling around the edges. \u201cCorrect,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for the sake of argument, what do you think might be wrong?\u201d", "\u201cIs the patient a student?\u201d\nArwyl raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat does that have to do with the price of butter?\u201d\n\u201cIf they work in the Fishery, it might be smelter\u2019s flu,\u201d I said. Arwyl cocked an eyebrow at me and I added, \u201cThere\u2019s all sorts of heavy metal poisoning you can get in the Fishery. It\u2019s rare around here because the students are welltrained, but anyone working with hot bronze can inhale enough fumes to kill themselves if they aren\u2019t properly careful.\u201d I saw Kilvin nodding along, and was glad I didn\u2019t have to admit the only reason I knew this was that I\u2019d given myself a mild case of it a month ago.\nArwyl gave a thoughtful humph, then gestured to the other side of the table. \u201cMaster Arithmetician?\u201d\nBrandeur sat on the left-hand point of the table. \u201cAssuming the changer takes four percent, how many pennies can you break from a talent?\u201d He asked the question without looking up from the papers in front of him.\n\u201cWhat type of penny, Master Brandeur?\u201d\nHe looked up, frowning. \u201cWe are still in the Commonwealth, if I remember correctly.\u201d\nI juggled numbers in my head, working from the figures in the books he\u2019d set aside in the Archives. They weren\u2019t the true exchange rates you would get from a moneylender, they were the official exchange rates governments and financiers used so they had common ground for lying to each other. \u201cIn iron pennies. Three hundred and fifty,\u201d I said, then added. \u201cOne. And a half.\u201d\nBrandeur looked down at the papers before I\u2019d even finished speaking. \u201cYour compass reads gold at two hundred twenty points, platinum at one hundred twelve points, and cobalt at thirty-two points. Where are you?\u201d\nI was boggled by the question. Orienting by trifoil required detailed maps and painstaking triangulation. It was usually only practiced by sea captains and cartographers, and they used detailed charts to make their calculations. I\u2019d only ever laid eyes on a trifoil compass twice in my life.\nEither this was a question listed in one of the books Brandeur had set aside for study or it was deliberately designed to spike my wheel. Given that Brandeur and Hemme were friends, I guessed it was the latter.\nI closed my eyes, brought up a map of the civilized world in my head, and took my best guess. \u201cTarbean?\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe somewhere in Yll?\u201d I opened my eyes. \u201cHonestly, I have no idea.\u201d\nBrandeur made a mark on a piece of paper. \u201cMaster Namer,\u201d he said", "without looking up.\nElodin gave me a wicked, knowing grin, and I was suddenly struck with\nthe fear that he might reveal my part of what we had done in Hemme\u2019s rooms earlier that morning.\nInstead he held up three fingers dramatically. \u201cYou have three spades in your hand,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there have been five spades played.\u201d He steepled his fingers and looked at me seriously. \u201cHow many spades is that?\u201d\n\u201cEight spades,\u201d I said.\nThe other masters stirred slightly in their seats. Arwyl sighed. Kilvin slouched. Hemme and Brandeur went to far as to roll their eyes at each other. All together they gave the impression of long-suffering exasperation.\nElodin scowled at them. \u201cWhat?\u201d he demanded, his voice going hard around the edges. \u201cYou want me to take this song and dance more seriously? You want me to ask him questions only a namer can answer?\u201d\nThe other masters stilled at this, looking uncomfortable and refusing to meet his eye. Hemme was the exception and glared openly.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Elodin said, turning back to me. His eyes were dark, and his voice had a strange resonance to it. It wasn\u2019t loud, but when he spoke, it seemed to fill the entire hall. It left no space left over for any other sound. \u201cWhere does the moon go,\u201d Elodin asked grimly, \u201cwhen it is no longer in our sky?\u201d\nThe room seemed unnaturally quiet when he stopped speaking. As if his voice had left a hole in the world.\nI waited to see if there was more to the question. \u201cI haven\u2019t the slightest,\u201d I admitted. After Elodin\u2019s voice, my own seemed rather thin and insubstantial.\nElodin shrugged, then gestured graciously across the table. \u201cMaster Sympathist.\u201d\nElxa Dal was the only one who really looked comfortable in his formal robes. As always, his dark beard and lean face made me think of the evil magician in so many bad Aturan plays. He gave me a bit of a sympathetic look. \u201cHow about the binding for linear galvanic attraction?\u201d he said in an offhand way.\nI rattled it off easily.\nHe nodded. \u201cWhat\u2019s the distance of insurmountable decay for iron?\u201d \u201cFive and a half miles,\u201d I said, giving the textbook answer despite the fact\nthat I had some quibbles with the term insurmountable. While it was true that moving any significant amount of energy more than six miles was statistically impossible, you could still use sympathy to dowse over much", "greater distances.\n\u201cOnce an ounce of water is boiling, how much heat will it take to boil it\ncompletely away?\u201d\nI dragged up what I could remember from the vaporization tables I\u2019d\nworked with in the Fishery. \u201cA hundred and eighty thaums.\u201d I said with more assurance than I actually felt.\n\u201cGood enough for me,\u201d Dal said. \u201cMaster Alchemist?\u201d Mandrag waved a mottled hand dismissively. \u201cI\u2019ll pass.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s good with questions about spades,\u201d Elodin suggested. Mandrag frowned at Elodin. \u201cMaster Archivist.\u201d\nLorren stared down at me, his long face impassive. \u201cWhat are the rules of the Archives?\u201d\nI flushed at this and looked down. \u201cMove quietly,\u201d I said. \u201cRespect the books. Obey the scrivs. No water. No food.\u201d I swallowed. \u201cNo fire.\u201d\nLorren nodded. Nothing in his tone or demeanor indicated any sort of disapproval, but that just made it worse. His eyes moved across the table. \u201cMaster Artificer.\u201d\nI cursed inwardly. Over the last span I\u2019d read all six books Master Lorren had set aside for Re\u2019lar to study from. Feltemi Reis\u2019 Fall of Empire alone took me ten hours. I wanted few things more than access to the Archives, and I\u2019d desperately hoped to impress Master Lorren by answering whatever question he could think to ask.\nBut there was no help for it. I turned to face Kilvin.\n\u201cGalvanic throughput of copper,\u201d the great bearlike master rumbled through his beard.\nI gave it to five places. I\u2019d had to use it while making calculations for the deck lamps.\n\u201cConductive coefficient of gallium.\u201d\nI\u2019d needed to know that to dope the emitters for the lamp. Was Kilvin lobbing me easy questions? I gave the answer.\n\u201cGood,\u201d Kilvin said. \u201cMaster Rhetorician.\u201d\nI drew a deep breath as I turned to look at Hemme. I had gone so far as to read three of his books, though I have a sharp loathing for rhetoric and pointless philosophy.\nStill, I could tamp down my distaste for two minutes\u2019 time and play the part of a good, humble student. I am one of the Ruh, I could act the part.\nHemme scowled at me, his round face like an angry moon. \u201cDid you set", "fire to my rooms, you little ravel bastard?\u201d\nThe raw nature of the question caught me entirely off my guard. I was\nready for impossibly hard questions, or trick questions, or questions he could twist to make any answer I gave seem wrong.\nBut this sudden accusation caught me utterly wrong-footed. Ravel is a term I particularly despise. A welter of emotion rolled through me and brought the sudden taste of plum to my mouth. While part of me was still considering the most gracious way to respond, I found I was already speaking. \u201cI didn\u2019t set fire to your rooms,\u201d I said honestly. \u201cBut I wish I had. And I wish you\u2019d been in there when it started, sleeping soundly.\u201d\nHemme\u2019s expression turned from scowling to astonished.\n\u201cRe\u2019lar Kvothe!\u201d the Chancellor snapped. \u201cYou will keep a civil tongue in your head, or I will bring you up on charges of Conduct Unbecoming myself!\u201d\nThe taste of plum disappeared as quickly as it had come, leaving me feeling slightly dizzy and sweating with fear and embarrassment. \u201cMy apologies, Chancellor,\u201d I said quickly, looking down at my feet. \u201cI spoke in anger. Ravel is a term my people find particularly offensive. Its use makes light of the systematic slaughter of thousands of Ruh.\u201d\nA curious line appeared between the Chancellor\u2019s eyebrows. \u201cI\u2019ll admit I don\u2019t know that particular etymology,\u201d he mused. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll make that my question.\u201d\n\u201cHold off,\u201d Hemme interrupted. \u201cI\u2019m not finished.\u201d\n\u201cYou are finished,\u201d the Chancellor said, his voice hard and firm. \u201cYou\u2019re as bad as the boy, Jasom, and with less excuse. You\u2019ve shown you can\u2019t conduct yourself in a professional manner, so stint thy clep and consider yourself lucky I don\u2019t call for an official censure.\u201d\nHemme went white with anger, but he held his tongue.\nThe Chancellor turned to look at me \u201cMaster Linguist,\u201d he announced himself formally. \u201cRe\u2019lar Kvothe: What is the etymology of the word ravel?\u201d\n\u201cIt comes from the purges instigated by Emperor Alcyon,\u201d I said. \u201cHe issued a proclamation saying any of the traveling rabble on the roads were subject to fine, imprisonment, or transportation without trial. The term became shortened to \u2018ravel\u2019 though metaplasmic enclitization.\u201d\nHe raised an eyebrow at that. \u201cDid it now?\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cThough I also expect there is a connection to the term ravelend, referring to the ragged appearance of performing troupes that are out at the", "heels.\u201d\nThe Chancellor nodded formally. \u201cThank you, Re\u2019lar Kvothe. Take a seat\nwhile we confer.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER TEN": ["CHAPTER TEN\nBeing Treasured\nMY TUITION WAS SET at nine talents and five. Better than the ten talents Manet had predicted, but more than I had in my purse. I had until tomorrow noon to settle up with the bursar or I would be forced to miss an entire term. Having to postpone my studies wouldn\u2019t have been a tragedy. But only students are allowed access to University resources, such as the equipment in the Artificery. That meant if I couldn\u2019t pay my tuition, I would be barred from my work in Kilvin\u2019s shop, the only job where I could hope to earn enough money for my tuition.\nI stopped at the Stocks and Jaxim smiled as I approached the open window. \u201cJust sold your lamps this morning,\u201d he said. \u201cWe squeezed them for a little extra because they were the last ones left.\u201d\nHe leafed through the ledger until he found the appropriate page. \u201cYour sixty percent comes out to four talents and eight jots. After the materials and piecework you used . . .\u201d He ran his finger down a page. \u201cYou\u2019re left with two talents, three jots, and eight drabs.\u201d\nJaxim made a note in the ledger, then wrote me a receipt. I folded the paper carefully and tucked it into my purse. It didn\u2019t have the satisfying weight of coins, but it brought my total up to more than six talents. So much money, but still not enough.\nIf I hadn\u2019t lost my temper with Hemme my tuition might have been low enough. I could have studied more, or earned more money if I hadn\u2019t been forced to hide in my room for almost two whole days, weeping and raging with the taste of plum in my mouth.\nA thought occurred to me. \u201cI should start something new, I guess,\u201d I said casually. \u201cI\u2019ll need a small crucible. Three ounces of tin. Two ounces of bronze. Four ounces of silver. A spool of fine gold wire. A copper\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHold on a second,\u201d Jaxim interrupted me. He ran a finger back along my name in the ledger. \u201cI don\u2019t have you authorized for gold or silver.\u201d He looked up at me. \u201cIs that a mistake?\u201d", "I hesitated, not wanting to lie. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you needed authorization,\u201d I said.\nJaxim gave me a knowing grin. \u201cYou\u2019re not the first one to try something like that,\u201d he said. \u201cRough tuition?\u201d\nI nodded.\nHe grimaced sympathetically. \u201cSorry. Kilvin knows Stocks could turn into a moneylender\u2019s stall if he isn\u2019t careful.\u201d He closed the ledger. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to hit the pawnshop like everyone else.\u201d\nI held up my hands, showing him the fronts and backs to make a point of my lack of jewelry.\nJaxim winced. \u201cThat\u2019s rough. I know a decent moneylender on Silver Court, only charges ten percent a month. It\u2019s still like having your teeth pulled, but better than most.\u201d\nI nodded and sighed. Silver Court was where the guild moneylenders had their shops. They wouldn\u2019t give me the time of day. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly better than I\u2019ve gotten in the past,\u201d I said.\nI thought things over while I walked to Imre, the familiar weight of my lute resting on one shoulder.\nI was in a tight spot, but not a terrible one. No guild moneylender would lend money to an orphan Edema Ruh with no collateral, but I could borrow the money from Devi. Still, I wish it hadn\u2019t come to that. Not only was her rate of interest extortionate, but I worried what favors she might require of me if I ever defaulted my loan. I doubted they would be small. Or easy. Or entirely legal.\nSuch were the turnings of my thoughts as I made my way over Stonebridge. I stopped by an apothecary, then made my way to the Grey Man.\nOpening the door, I saw the Grey Man was a boarding house. There was no common room where people could gather and drink. Instead there was a small, richly-appointed parlor, complete with a well-dressed porter who eyed me with an air of disapproval, if not outright distaste.\n\u201cCan I help you, young sir?\u201d he asked as I came in the door. \u201cI\u2019m calling on a young lady,\u201d I said. \u201cBy the name of Dinael.\u201d\n \nHe nodded. \u201cI shall go and see if she is in.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t trouble yourself,\u201d I said, moving toward the stairs. \u201cShe\u2019s expecting me.\u201d\nThe man moved to block my way. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that isn\u2019t possible,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I will be glad to see if the lady is in.\u201d\nHe held out his hand. I looked at it.\n\u201cYour calling card?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat I might present it to the young lady?\u201d \u201cHow can you give her my card if you aren\u2019t sure she is in?\u201d I asked.\nThe porter gave me the smile again. It was gracious, polite, and so sharply\nunpleasant that I took special note of it, fixing it in my memory. A smile like that is a work of art. As someone who grew up on the stage, I could appreciate it on several levels. A smile like that is like a knife in certain social settings, and I might have need of it someday.\n\u201cAh,\u201d the porter said. \u201cThe lady is in,\u201d he said with a certain emphasis. \u201cBut that does not necessarily mean she is in for you.\u201d\n\u201cYou can tell her Kvothe has come calling,\u201d I said, more amused than offended. \u201cI\u2019ll wait.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t have to wait long. The porter came down the stairs wearing an irritated expression, as if he\u2019d been looking forward to throwing me out. \u201cThis way,\u201d he said.\nI followed him upstairs. He opened a door, and I swept past him with what I hoped was an irritating amount of dismissive aplomb.\nIt was a sitting room with wide windows that let in the late afternoon sun, large enough to seem spacious despite the scattered chairs and couches. A hammer dulcimer sat against the far wall, and one corner of the room was entirely occupied by a massive Modegan great harp.\nDenna stood in the center of the room wearing a green velvet dress. Her hair was arranged to display her elegant neck to good effect, revealing the emerald teardrop earrings and matching necklace at her throat.\nShe was talking to a young man who was . . . the best word I can think of is pretty. He had a sweet, clean-shaven face with wide, dark eyes.\nHe had the look of a young noble who had been down on his luck too long for it to be a temporary thing. His clothing was fine but rumpled. His dark hair was cut in a style obviously meant to be curled, but it hadn\u2019t been tended to recently. His eyes were sunken, as if he hadn\u2019t been sleeping well.\nDenna held out her hands to me. \u201cKvothe,\u201d she said. \u201cCome meet Geoffrey.\u201d", "\u201cPleasure to meet you, Kvothe,\u201d Geoffrey said. \u201cDinael has told me quite a bit about you. You\u2019re a bit of a\u2014what is it? Wizard?\u201d His smile was open and utterly guileless.\n\u201cArcanist actually,\u201d I said as politely as possible. \u201cWizard brings too much storybook nonsense to mind. People expect us to wear dark robes and fling about the entrails of birds. And yourself?\u201d\n\u201cGeoffrey is a poet,\u201d Denna said. \u201cAnd a good one, though he\u2019ll deny it.\u201d\n\u201cI will,\u201d he admitted, then his smile faded. \u201cI have to go. I have an appointment with folk who shouldn\u2019t be kept waiting.\u201d He gave Denna a kiss on the cheek, shook my hand warmly, and left.\nDenna watched the door close behind him. \u201cHe\u2019s a sweet boy.\u201d\n\u201cYou say that as if you regret it,\u201d I said.\n\u201cIf he were a little less sweet, he might be able to fit two thoughts in his\nhead at the same time. Maybe they would rub together and make a spark. Even a little smoke would be nice, then at least it would look like something was happening in there.\u201d She sighed.\n\u201cIs he really that thick?\u201d\nShe shook her head. \u201cNo. He\u2019s just trusting. Hasn\u2019t got a calculating bone in his body, and he\u2019s done nothing but make bad choices since he got here a month ago.\u201d\nI reached into my cloak and brought out a pair of small, cloth-wrapped bundles: one blue, one white. \u201cI\u2019ve brought you a present.\u201d\nDenna reached out to take them, looking slightly puzzled.\nWhat had seemed like such a good idea a few hours ago now seemed rather foolish. \u201cThey\u2019re for your lungs,\u201d I said, suddenly embarrassed. \u201cI know you have trouble sometimes.\u201d\nShe tilted her head on one side. \u201cAnd how do you know that, pray tell?\u201d\n\u201cYou mentioned it when we were in Trebon,\u201d I said. \u201cI did some research.\u201d I pointed. \u201cThat one you can brew in a tea: featherbite, deadnettle, lohatm. . . .\u201d I pointed to the other. \u201cThat one you boil the leaves in some water and breathe the vapor coming off the top.\u201d\nDenna looked back and forth between the packages.\n\u201cI\u2019ve written instructions on slips of paper inside,\u201d I said. \u201cThe blue one is the one you\u2019re supposed to boil and breathe the vapor,\u201d I said. \u201cBlue for water, you see.\u201d\nShe looked up at me. \u201cDon\u2019t you make a tea with water, too?\u201d\nI blinked at that, then flushed and started to say something, but Denna", "laughed and shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m teasing you,\u201d she said gently. \u201cThank you. This is the sweetest thing anyone\u2019s done for me in a long while.\u201d\nDenna walked over to a chest of drawers and tucked the two bundles carefully into an ornate wooden box.\n\u201cYou seem to be doing fairly well for yourself,\u201d I said, gesturing to the well-appointed room.\nDenna shrugged, looking around the room indifferently. \u201cKellin is doing well for himself,\u201d she said. \u201cI merely stand in his reflected light.\u201d\nI nodded my understanding. \u201cI\u2019d thought perhaps you\u2019d found yourself a patron.\u201d\n\u201cNothing so formal as that. Kellin and I are walking about together, as they say in Modeg, and he is showing me my way around the harp.\u201d She nodded to where the instrument loomed hugely in the corner.\n\u201cCare to show me what you\u2019ve learned?\u201d I asked.\nDenna shook her head, embarrassed. Her hair slid down around her shoulders as she did so. \u201cI\u2019m not very good yet.\u201d\n\u201cI will restrain my natural urge to jeer and hiss,\u201d I said graciously.\nDenna laughed. \u201cFine. Just a bit.\u201d She walked behind the harp and drew up a tall stool to lean against. Then she lifted her hands to the strings, paused for a long moment, and began to play.\nThe melody was a variant of \u201cBell-Wether.\u201d I smiled.\nHer playing was slow, almost stately. Too many people think speed is the hallmark of a good musician. It\u2019s understandable. What Marie had done at the Eolian was amazing. But how quickly you can finger notes is the smallest part of music. The real key is timing.\nIt\u2019s like telling a joke. Anyone can remember the words. Anyone can repeat it. But making someone laugh requires more than that. Telling a joke faster doesn\u2019t make it funnier. As with many things, hesitation is better than hurry.\nThis is why there are so few true musicians. A lot of folks can sing or saw out a tune on a fiddle. A music box can play a song flawlessly, again and again. But knowing the notes isn\u2019t enough. You have to know how to play them. Speed comes with time and practice, but timing you are born with. You have it or you don\u2019t.\nDenna had it. She moved slowly through the song, but she wasn\u2019t plodding. She played it slow as a luxurious kiss. Not that I knew anything of kissing at that point in my life. But as she stood with her arms around the", "harp, her eyes half-lidded with concentration, her lips lightly pursed, I knew I someday wanted to be kissed with that amount of slow, deliberate care.\nAnd she was beautiful. I suppose it should come as no surprise that I have a particular fondness for women with music running through them. But as she played I saw her for the first time that day. Before I had been distracted by the difference in her hair, the cut of her dress. But as she played, all that faded from view.\nI ramble. Suffice to say she was impressive, though obviously still learning. She struck a few bad notes, but didn\u2019t flinch or cringe away from them. As they say, a jeweler knows the uncut gem. And I am. And she was. And so.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a long way past \u2018Squirrel in the Thatch,\u2019 \u201d I said quietly after she\u2019d struck the final notes.\nShe shrugged my compliment away, not meeting my eye. \u201cI don\u2019t have much to do but practice,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd Kellin says I have a bit of a knack.\u201d\n\u201cHow long have you been at it?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cThree span?\u201d She looked thoughtful, then nodded. \u201cA little less than three span.\u201d\n\u201cMother of God,\u201d I said, shaking my head. \u201cDon\u2019t ever tell anyone how quickly you\u2019ve picked it up. Other musicians will hate you for it.\u201d\n\u201cMy fingers aren\u2019t used to it yet,\u201d she said, looking down at them. \u201cI can\u2019t practice nearly as long as I like.\u201d\nI reached out and took hold of one of her hands, turning it palm up so I could see her fingertips. There were fading blisters there. \u201cYou\u2019ve . . .\u201d\nI looked up and realized how close she was standing. Her hand was cool in mine. She stared at me with huge, dark eyes. One eyebrow slightly raised. Not arch, or playful even, just gently curious. My stomach felt suddenly strange and weak.\n\u201cI\u2019ve what?\u201d she asked.\nI realized I had no idea what I had been about to say. I thought of saying, I have no idea what I was going to say. Then I realized that would be a stupid thing to say. So I didn\u2019t say anything.\nDenna looked down and took hold of my hand, turning it over. \u201cYour hands are soft,\u201d she said, then touched my fingertips lightly. \u201cI thought the calluses would be rough, but they\u2019re not. They\u2019re smooth.\u201d\nOnce her eyes weren\u2019t fixed on mine, I regained a small piece of my wits. \u201cIt just takes time,\u201d I said.", "Denna looked up and gave a shy smile. My mind went blank as fresh paper.\nAfter a moment, Denna let go of my hand and moved past me to the center of the room. \u201cWould you care for something to drink?\u201d she asked as she settled gracefully into a chair.\n\u201cThat would be very kind of you,\u201d I said purely on reflex. I realized my hand was still hanging stupidly in midair, and I let it fall to my side.\nShe gestured to a nearby chair and I sat.\n\u201cWatch this.\u201d She picked up a small silver bell from a nearby table and rang it softly. Then she held up one hand with all five fingers extended. She folded in her thumb, then her index finger, counting downward.\nBefore she folded in her smallest finger, there came a knock on the door.\n\u201cCome in,\u201d Denna called, and the well-dressed porter opened the door. \u201cI believe I would like some drinking chocolate,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd Kvothe . . .\u201d She looked at me questioningly.\n\u201cDrinking chocolate sounds lovely,\u201d I said.\nThe porter nodded and disappeared, closing the door behind him. \u201cSometimes I do it just to make him run,\u201d Denna admitted sheepishly,\nlooking down at the bell. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how he can hear it. For a while, I was convinced he was sitting in the hallway with his ear against my door.\u201d\n\u201cCan I see the bell?\u201d I asked.\nShe handed it over. It looked normal at first glance, but when I turned it upside down I saw some tiny sygaldry on the inner surface of the bell.\n\u201cHe isn\u2019t eavesdropping,\u201d I said, handing it back. \u201cThere\u2019s another bell downstairs that rings in time with this one.\u201d\n\u201cHow?\u201d She asked, then answered her own question. \u201cMagic?\u201d\n\u201cYou could call it that.\u201d\n\u201cIs that the sort of thing you do over there?\u201d She jerked her head in the\ndirection of the river and the University beyond. \u201cIt seems a little . . . tawdry.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most frivolous use of sygaldry I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d I said.\nDenna burst out laughing. \u201cYou sound so offended,\u201d she said. Then, \u201cIt\u2019s called sygaldry?\u201d\n\u201cMaking something like that is called artificing,\u201d I said. \u201cSygaldry is writing or carving the runes that make it work.\u201d\nDenna\u2019s eyes lit up at this. \u201cSo it\u2019s a magic where you write things down?\u201d she asked, leaning forward in her chair. \u201cHow does it work?\u201d", "I hesitated. Not only because it was a huge question, but because the University has very specific rules about sharing Arcanum secrets. \u201cIt\u2019s rather complicated,\u201d I said.\nLuckily, at that moment there was another knock on the door and our chocolate arrived in steaming cups. My mouth watered at the smell of it. The man set the tray on a nearby table and left without a word.\nI sipped and smiled at the thick sweetness of it. \u201cIt\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve had chocolate,\u201d I said.\nDenna lifted her cup and looked around the room. \u201cIt\u2019s strange to think some people live their whole lives like this,\u201d she mused.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not to your liking?\u201d I asked, surprised.\n\u201cI like the chocolate and the harp,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I could do without the bell and a whole room just for sitting.\u201d Her mouth curved into the beginning of a frown. \u201cAnd I hate knowing someone is set to guard me, like I\u2019m a treasure someone might try to steal.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not to be treasured, then?\u201d\nShe narrowed her eyes over the top of her cup, as if she wasn\u2019t sure how serious I was. \u201cI don\u2019t fancy being under lock and key,\u201d she clarified with a grim note in her voice. \u201cI don\u2019t mind being given rooms, but they aren\u2019t really mine if I\u2019m not free to come and go.\u201d\nI raised an eyebrow at that, but before I could say anything she waved her hand dismissively. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that really,\u201d she sighed. \u201cBut I don\u2019t doubt Kellin is informed of my comings and goings. I know the porter tells him who comes calling. It rankles a bit is all.\u201d She gave a crooked smile. \u201cI suppose that seems terribly ungrateful, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d I said. \u201cWhen I was younger, my troupe traveled everywhere. But every year we would spend a few span at our patron\u2019s estate, performing for his family and his guests.\u201d\nI shook my head at the memory. \u201cBaron Greyfallow was a gracious host. We sat at his own table. He gave us gifts . . .\u201d I trailed off, remembering a regiment of tiny lead soldiers he\u2019d given me. I shook my head clear of the thought. \u201cBut my father hated it. Climbed the walls. He couldn\u2019t tolerate the feeling of being at someone\u2019s beck and call.\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d Denna said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly it! If Kellin says he might pay me a visit on such and such evening, suddenly I feel I\u2019ve had one foot nailed to the floor. If I leave I\u2019m being obstinate and rude, but if I stay I feel like a dog waiting by the door.\u201d", "We sat for a moment in silence. Denna twirled the ring on her finger absentmindedly, sunlight catching the pale blue stone.\n\u201cStill,\u201d I said, looking around. \u201cThey are nice rooms.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re nice when you\u2019re here,\u201d she said.\nSeveral hours later, I climbed a narrow flight of stairs behind a butcher\u2019s shop. There was a faint, pervasive smell of rancid fat from the alley below, but I was smiling. An afternoon with Denna entirely to myself was a rare treat, and my step was surprisingly light for someone about to make a deal with a demon.\nI knocked on the solid wooden door at the top of the steps and waited. No guild moneylender would trust me with a bent penny, but there are always folk willing to lend money. Poets and other romantics call them copper hawks, or sharps, but gaelet is the better term. They are dangerous people, and wise folk steer well clear of them.\nThe door opened a crack, then swung wide, revealing a young woman with a pixie face and strawberry-blonde hair. \u201cKvothe!\u201d Devi exclaimed. \u201cI worried I might not see you this term.\u201d\nI stepped inside, and Devi bolted the door behind me. The large, windowless room smelled pleasantly of cinnas fruit and honey, a refreshing change from the alley.\nOne side of the room was dominated by a huge canopy bed, its dark curtains drawn. On the other side was a fireplace, a large wooden desk, and a standing bookshelf three-quarters full. I wandered over to eye the titles while Devi locked and barred the door.\n\u201cIs this copy of Malcaf new?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cIt is,\u201d she said walking over to stand beside me. \u201cA young alchemist who couldn\u2019t settle his debt let me pick through his library in order to square things between us.\u201d Devi carefully pulled the book from the shelf, revealing Vision and Revision in gold leaf on the cover. She looked up at me, grinning impishly. \u201cHave you read it?\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t,\u201d I said. I\u2019d wanted to study it for admissions but hadn\u2019t been able to find a copy in the Stacks. \u201cJust heard about it.\u201d\nDevi looked thoughtful for a moment, then handed it to me. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve\n \nfinished, come back and we\u2019ll discuss it. I\u2019m woefully devoid of interesting conversation these days. If we have a decent argument, I might let you borrow another.\u201d\nOnce the book was in my hands, she tapped the cover lightly with a finger. \u201cThis book is worth more than you are.\u201d She said without a hint of playfulness in her voice. \u201cIf it comes back damaged, there will be an accounting.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be very careful,\u201d I said.\nDevi nodded, then turned and walked past me toward the desk. \u201cRight then, on to business.\u201d She sat down. \u201cCutting it a little close, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked. \u201cTuition needs to be paid before noon tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cI live a dangerous and exciting life,\u201d I said as I wandered over and took a seat across from her. \u201cAnd delightful as I find your company, I was hoping to avoid your services this term.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you like tuition as a Re\u2019lar?\u201d she asked knowingly. \u201cHow hard did they hit you?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a rather personal question,\u201d I said.\nDevi gave me a frank look. \u201cWe are about to enter into a rather personal arrangement,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cI hardly feel I\u2019m overstepping myself.\u201d\n\u201cNine and a half,\u201d I said.\nShe snorted derisively. \u201cI thought you were supposed to be all manner of clever. I never got higher than seven when I was a Re\u2019lar.\u201d\n\u201cYou had access to the Archives,\u201d I pointed out.\n\u201cI had access to vast stores of intellect,\u201d she said matter-of-factly. \u201cPlus, I am cute as a button.\u201d She gave a grin that brought out dimples in both her cheeks.\n\u201cYou are shiny as a new penny,\u201d I admitted. \u201cNo man can hope to stand against you.\u201d\n\u201cSome women have trouble keeping their feet as well,\u201d she said. Her grin changed slightly, moving from adorable to impish and then well past the border into wicked.\nNot having the slightest idea how to respond to that, I moved in a safer direction. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I need to borrow four talents.\u201d I said.\n\u201cAh,\u201d Devi said. Suddenly businesslike, she folded her hands atop the desk. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve made a few changes to my business recently,\u201d she said. \u201cCurrently, I am only extending loans of six talents or more.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t bother trying to hide my dismay. \u201cSix talents? Devi, that extra debt", "will be a millstone around my neck.\u201d\nShe gave a sigh that sounded at least slightly apologetic. \u201cHere\u2019s the\ntrouble. When I make a loan, I run certain risks. I risk losing my investment if my debtor dies or tries to run. I run the risk they\u2019ll attempt to report me. I run the risk of being brought up against the iron law, or worse, the moneylender\u2019s guild.\u201d\n\u201cYou know I\u2019d never try something like that, Devi.\u201d\n\u201cThe fact remains,\u201d Devi continued, \u201cmy risk is the same, no matter if the loan is small or large. Why should I take those risks for small loans?\u201d\n\u201cSmall?\u201d I asked. \u201cI could live for a year on four talents!\u201d\nShe tapped the desk with a finger, pursing her mouth. \u201cCollateral?\u201d\n\u201cThe usual,\u201d I said, giving her my best smile. \u201cMy boundless charm.\u201d Devi snorted indelicately. \u201cFor boundless charm and three drops of blood\nyou can borrow six talents at my standard rate. Fifty percent interest over a two-month term.\u201d\n\u201cDevi,\u201d I said ingratiatingly. \u201cWhat am I going to do with the extra money?\u201d\n\u201cThrow a party,\u201d she suggested. \u201cSpend a day in the Buckle. Find yourself a nice game of high-stakes faro.\u201d\n\u201cFaro,\u201d I said, \u201cis a tax on people who can\u2019t calculate probabilities.\u201d\n\u201cThen run bank and collect the tax,\u201d she said. \u201cBuy yourself something pretty and wear it next time you come in to see me.\u201d She looked me up and down with dangerous eyes. \u201cMaybe then I\u2019ll be willing to cut you a deal.\u201d\n\u201cHow about six talents for a month at twenty-five percent?\u201d I asked.\nDevi shook her head, not unkindly. \u201cKvothe, I respect the impulse to bargain, but you don\u2019t have any leverage. You\u2019re here because you\u2019re over a barrel. I\u2019m here to capitalize on that situation.\u201d She spread her hands in a helpless gesture. \u201cThat\u2019s how I make my living. The fact that you have a sweet face doesn\u2019t really enter into it.\u201d\nDevi gave me a serious look. \u201cConversely, if a guild moneylender would give you the time of day, I wouldn\u2019t expect you to come here simply because I\u2019m pretty and you like the color of my hair.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a lovely color,\u201d I said. \u201cWe fiery types should really stick together.\u201d\n\u201cWe should,\u201d she agreed. \u201cI propose we stick together at fifty percent interest over a two month term.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d I said, slumping back into my chair. \u201cYou win.\u201d\nDevi gave me a winsome smile, dimples showing again. \u201cI can only win if", "we were both actually playing.\u201d She opened a drawer in the desk, bringing out a small glass bottle and a long pin.\nI reached out to take them, but instead of sliding them across the desk, she gave me a thoughtful look. \u201cNow that I think of it, there might be another option.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d love another option,\u201d I admitted.\n\u201cThe last time we talked,\u201d Devi said slowly, \u201cyou implied you had a way into the Archives.\u201d\nI hesitated. \u201cI did imply that.\u201d\n\u201cThat information would be worth quite a bit to me,\u201d she said overcasually. Though she tried to hide it, I could see a fierce, lean hunger in her eyes.\nI looked down at my hands and didn\u2019t say anything.\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you ten talents right now,\u201d Devi said bluntly. \u201cNot a loan. I\u2019ll buy the information outright. If I get caught in the Stacks, I never learned it from you.\u201d\nI thought of everything I could do with ten talents. New clothes. A lute case that wasn\u2019t about to fall to pieces. Paper. Gloves for the coming winter.\nI sighed and shook my head.\n\u201cTwenty talents,\u201d Devi said. \u201cAnd guild rates on any loans you want in the future.\u201d\nTwenty talents would mean half a year of worry-free tuition. I could pursue my own projects in the Fishery rather than slaving away at deck lamps. I could buy tailored clothes. Fresh fruit. I could use a laundry rather than wash my clothes myself.\nI drew a reluctant breath. \u201cI\u2014\u201d\n\u201cForty talents,\u201d Devi said hungrily. \u201cGuild rates. And I will take you to bed.\u201d\nFor forty talents I could buy Denna her own half-harp. I could . . .\nI looked up and saw Devi staring at me from across the desk. Her lips were wet, her pale blue eyes intense. She shifted her shoulders back and forth in the slow, unconscious motion of a cat before it pounces.\nI thought of Auri, safe and happy in the Underthing. What would she do if her tiny kingdom was invaded by a stranger?\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cI can\u2019t. Getting in is . . . complicated. It involves a friend, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019d be willing.\u201d I decided to ignore the other part of her offer, as I hadn\u2019t the slightest idea what to say about it.", "There was a long, tense moment. \u201cGoddamn you,\u201d Devi said at last. \u201cYou sound like you\u2019re telling the truth.\u201d\n\u201cI am,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s unsettling, I know.\u201d\n\u201cGoddamn.\u201d She scowled as she pushed the bottle and pin across the desk. I pricked the back of my hand and watched the blood well up and roll\ndown my hand to fall into the bottle. After three drops I tipped the pin into the mouth of the bottle as well.\nDevi swabbed some adhesive around the stopper and drove it angrily into the bottle. Then she reached into a drawer and pulled out a diamond stylus. \u201cDo you trust me?\u201d She asked as she etched a number into the glass. \u201cOr do you want this sealed?\u201d\n\u201cI trust you,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I\u2019d like it sealed all the same.\u201d\nShe melted a daub of sealing wax onto the top of the bottle. I pressed my talent pipes into it, leaving a recognizable impression.\nReaching into another drawer, Devi brought out six talents and clattered them onto the desk. The motion might have seemed petulant if her eyes hadn\u2019t been so hard and angry.\n\u201cI\u2019m getting in there one way or another,\u201d she said with a chill edge to her voice. \u201cTalk to your friend. If you\u2019re the one that helps me, I\u2019ll make it worth your time.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER ELEVEN": ["CHAPTER ELEVEN\nHaven\nI RETURNED TO THE UNIVERSITY in good spirits despite the burden of my new debt. I made a few purchases, gathered up my lute, and headed out over the rooftops.\nFrom the inside, Mains was a nightmare to navigate: a maze of irrational hallways and stairways leading nowhere. But moving across its jumbled rooftops was easy as anything. I made my way to a small courtyard that at some point in the building\u2019s construction had become completely inaccessible, trapped like a fly in amber.\nAuri wasn\u2019t expecting me, but this was the first place I\u2019d met her, and on clear nights she sometimes came out to watch the stars. I checked to make sure the classrooms overlooking the courtyard were dark and empty, then I brought out my lute and began to tune it.\nI had been playing for almost an hour when I heard a rustling movement in the overgrown courtyard below. Then Auri appeared, scurrying up the overgrown apple tree and onto the roof.\nShe ran toward me, her bare feet skipping lightly across the tar, her hair blowing behind her. \u201cI heard you!\u201d she said as she came close. \u201cI heard you all the way down in Vaults!\u201d\n\u201cI seem to remember,\u201d I said slowly, \u201cthat I was going to play music for someone.\u201d\n\u201cMe!\u201d She held both her hands close to her chest, grinning. She moved from foot to foot, almost dancing with her eagerness. \u201cPlay for me! I have been as patient as two stones together,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are just in time. I could not be as patient as three stones.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said hesitantly. \u201cI suppose it all depends on what you\u2019ve brought me.\u201d\nShe laughed, rising up onto the balls of her feet, her hands still together, close to her chest. \u201cWhat did you bring me?\u201d\nI knelt and began to untie my bundle. \u201cI\u2019ve brought you three things,\u201d I", "said.\n\u201cHow traditional,\u201d she said, grinning. \u201cYou are quite the proper young\ngentleman tonight.\u201d\n\u201cI am.\u201d I held up a heavy dark bottle.\nShe took it with both hands. \u201cWho made it?\u201d\n\u201cBees,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd brewers in Bredon.\u201d\nAuri smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s three bees,\u201d she said, and set the bottle down by her\nfeet. I brought out a round loaf of fresh barley bread. She reached out and touched it with a finger, then nodded approvingly.\nLast I brought out a whole smoked salmon. It had cost four drabs by itself, but I worried Auri didn\u2019t get enough meat in whatever she managed to scrounge up when I wasn\u2019t around. It would be good for her.\nAuri looked down at it curiously, tilting her head to look into its single staring eye. \u201cHello fish,\u201d she said. Then she looked back up at me. \u201cDoes it have a secret?\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cIt has a harp instead of a heart.\u201d\nShe looked back down at it. \u201cNo wonder it looks so surprised.\u201d\nAuri took the fish out of my hands and laid it carefully on the roof. \u201cNow\nstand up. I have three things for you, as is only fair.\u201d\nI came to my feet and she held out something wrapped in a piece of cloth.\nIt was a thick candle that smelled of lavender. \u201cWhat\u2019s inside of it?\u201d I asked. \u201cHappy dreams,\u201d she said. \u201cI put them there for you.\u201d\nI turned the candle over in my hands, a suspicion forming. \u201cDid you make\nthis yourself?\u201d\nShe nodded and gave a delighted grin. \u201cI did. I am terribly clever.\u201d\nI tucked it carefully into one of the pockets of my cloak. \u201cThank you,\nAuri.\u201d\nAuri grew serious. \u201cNow close your eyes and bend down so I can give you\nyour second present.\u201d\nPuzzled, I closed my eyes and bent at the waist, wondering if she had made\nme a hat as well.\nI felt her hands on either side of my face, then she gave me a tiny, delicate\nkiss in the middle of my forehead.\nSurprised, I opened my eyes. But she was already standing several steps\naway, her hands clasped nervously behind her back. I couldn\u2019t think of anything to say.\nAuri took a step forward. \u201cYou are special to me,\u201d she said seriously, her", "face grave. \u201cI want you to know I will always take care of you.\u201d She reached out tentatively and wiped at my cheeks. \u201cNo. None of that tonight. This is your third present. If things are bad, you can come and stay with me in the Underthing. It is nice there, and you will be safe.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Auri,\u201d I said as soon as I was able. \u201cYou are special to me, too.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I am,\u201d she said matter-of-factly. \u201cI am as lovely as the moon.\u201d\nI collected myself while Auri skipped over to a piece of metal piping that jutted from a chimney and used it to pry the cap off the bottle. Then she brought it back, holding it carefully with both hands.\n\u201cAuri,\u201d I asked. \u201cAren\u2019t your feet cold?\u201d\nShe looked down at them. \u201cThe tar is nice,\u201d she said, wriggling her toes. \u201cIt\u2019s still warm from the sun.\u201d\n\u201cWould you like a pair of shoes?\u201d\n\u201cWhat would they have in them?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cYour feet,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be winter soon.\u201d\nShe shrugged.\n\u201cYour feet will be cold.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t come out on top of things in the winter,\u201d she said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t very\nnice.\u201d\nBefore I could respond, Elodin stepped around a large brick chimney as\ncasually as if he were out for an afternoon stroll.\nThe three of us stared at each other for a moment, each of us startled in our\nown way. Elodin and I were surprised, but out of the corner of my eye I saw Auri grow perfectly still, like a deer ready to spring away to safety.\n\u201cMaster Elodin,\u201d I said in my gentlest, friendliest tones, desperately hoping he wouldn\u2019t do anything that might startle Auri into running. The last time she\u2019d been scared back underground it had taken her a full span to re-emerge. \u201cHow nice to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cHello there,\u201d Elodin said, matching my casual tone perfectly, as if there was nothing odd about the three of us meeting on a rooftop in the middle of the night. Though for all I knew, it might not seem odd to him.\n\u201cMaster Elodin.\u201d Auri dipped one bare foot behind the other and tugged the edges of her ragged dress in a tiny curtsey.\nElodin remained in the moon-cast shadow of the tall brick chimney. He made a curiously formal bow in return. I couldn\u2019t see his face in any detail, but I could imagine his curious eyes examining the barefoot, waifish girl with", "the nimbus of floating hair. \u201cAnd what brings the two of you out this fine night?\u201d Elodin asked.\nI tensed. Questions were dangerous with Auri.\nLuckily, this one didn\u2019t seem to bother her. \u201cKvothe has brought me lovely things,\u201d she said. \u201cHe brought me bee beer and barley bread and a smoked fish with a harp where its heart should be.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d Elodin said, stepping away from the chimney. He patted his robes until he found something in a pocket. He held it out to her. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve only brought you a cinnas fruit.\u201d\nAuri took a tiny, dancer\u2019s step backward and made no motion to take it. \u201cHave you brought anything for Kvothe?\u201d\nThis seemed to catch Elodin off his stride. He stood awkwardly for a moment, arm outstretched. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I haven\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t imagine Kvothe has brought anything for me, either.\u201d\nAuri\u2019s eyes narrowed, and she gave a tiny frown, fierce with disapproval. \u201cKvothe has brought music,\u201d she said sternly, \u201cwhich is for everyone.\u201d\nElodin paused again, and I have to admit I enjoyed seeing him discomfited by someone else\u2019s behavior for once. He turned and made a half bow in my direction. \u201cMy apologies,\u201d he said.\nI made a gracious gesture. \u201cThink nothing of it.\u201d\nElodin turned back to Auri and held out his hand a second time.\nShe took two small steps forward, hesitated, then took two more. She\nreached out slowly, paused with her hand on the small fruit, then took several scurrying steps away, bringing both hands close to her chest. \u201cThank you kindly,\u201d she said, making another small curtsey. \u201cNow, you may join us if you like. And if you behave, you may stay and listen to Kvothe play afterward.\u201d She tilted her head a bit, making it a question.\nElodin hesitated, then nodded.\nAuri scampered around to the other side of the roof, then down into the courtyard through the bare limbs of the apple tree.\nElodin watched her go. When he tilted his head there was just enough moonlight that I could see a thoughtful expression on his face. I felt a sudden, sharp anxiety tie knots in my stomach. \u201cMaster Elodin?\u201d\nHe turned to face me. \u201cHmm?\u201d\nI knew from experience it would only take her three or four minutes to fetch whatever she was bringing up from the Underthing. I needed to talk fast.", "\u201cI know this looks strange,\u201d I said. \u201cBut you have to be careful. She\u2019s very nervous. Don\u2019t try to touch her. Don\u2019t make any sudden movements. It will scare her away.\u201d\nElodin expression was hidden in shadow again. \u201cWill it now?\u201d he said.\n\u201cLoud noises too. Even a loud laugh. And you can\u2019t ask her anything resembling a personal question. She\u2019ll just run if you do.\u201d I drew a deep breath, my mind racing. I have a good tongue in my head, and given enough time I\u2019m confident in my ability to persuade just about anyone of anything. But Elodin was simply too unpredictable to manipulate.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t tell anyone she\u2019s here.\u201d It came out more forcefully than I\u2019d intended, and I immediately regretted my choice of words. I was in no position to be giving orders to one of the masters, even if he was more than half mad. \u201cWhat I mean,\u201d I said quickly, \u201cis that I would take it as a great personal favor if you didn\u2019t mention her to anyone.\u201d\nElodin gave me a long, speculative look. \u201cAnd why is that, Re\u2019lar Kvothe?\u201d\nI felt myself break out in a sweat at the cool amusement in his tone. \u201cThey\u2019ll stick her in Haven,\u201d I said. \u201cYou of all people ...\u201d I trailed off, my throat growing dry.\nElodin stared down at me, his face little more than a shadow, but I could sense him scowling. \u201cOf all people I what, Re\u2019lar Kvothe? Do you presume to know my feelings toward Haven?\u201d\nI felt all my elegant, half-planned persuasion fall to tatters around my feet. And I suddenly felt like I was back on the streets of Tarbean, my stomach a hard knot of hunger, my chest full of desperate hopelessness as I clutched at the sleeves of sailors and merchants, begging for pennies, halfpennies, shims. Begging for anything so I could get something to eat.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d I said to him. \u201cPlease, Master Elodin, if they chase her she\u2019ll hide, and I won\u2019t be able to find her. She isn\u2019t quite right in the head, but she\u2019s happy here. And I can take care of her. Not much, but a little. If they catch her that would be even worse. Haven would kill her. Please Master Elodin, I\u2019ll do whatever you like. Just don\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d\n\u201cHush,\u201d Elodin said. \u201cShe\u2019s coming.\u201d He reached out to grip my shoulder, and moonlight fell across his face. His expression wasn\u2019t fierce and hard at all. There was nothing but puzzlement and concern. \u201cLord and lady, you\u2019re shaking. Take a breath and put your stage face on. You\u2019ll scare her if she sees you like this.\u201d", "I took a deep breath and fought to relax. Elodin\u2019s concerned expression faded and he stepped back, letting go of my shoulder.\nI turned in time to see Auri scurry across the roof toward us, her arms full. She stopped a short distance away, eyeing us both, before coming the rest of the way, stepping carefully as a dancer until she was back where she originally stood. Then she sat down lightly on the roof, crossing her legs beneath herself. Elodin and I sat as well, though not nearly as gracefully.\nAuri unfolded a cloth, lay it carefully between the three of us, then set a large, smooth wooden platter in the middle. She brought out the cinnas fruit and sniffed it, her eyes peering over the top of it. \u201cWhat is in this?\u201d she asked Elodin.\n\u201cSunshine,\u201d he said easily, as if he\u2019d expected the question. \u201cAnd early morning sunshine at that.\u201d\nThey knew each other. Of course. That was why she hadn\u2019t run away at the outset. I felt the solid bar of tension between my shoulder blades ease slightly.\nAuri sniffed the fruit again and looked thoughtful for a moment. \u201cIt is lovely,\u201d she declared. \u201cBut Kvothe\u2019s things are lovelier still.\u201d\n\u201cThat stands to reason,\u201d Elodin said. \u201cI expect Kvothe is a nicer person than I am.\u201d\n\u201cThat goes without saying,\u201d Auri said primly.\nAuri served up dinner, sharing out the bread and fish to each of us. She also produced a squat clay jar of brined olives. It made me glad to see she could provide for herself when I wasn\u2019t around.\nAuri poured beer into my familiar porcelain teacup. Elodin got a small glass jar of the sort you would use to store jam. She filled his cup for the first round but not the second. I was left wondering if he was simply out of easy reach, or if it was a subtle sign of her displeasure.\nWe ate without speaking. Auri delicately, taking tiny bites, her back straight. Elodin cautiously, occasionally darting a glance at me as if he were unsure how to behave. I guessed from this that he\u2019d never shared a meal with Auri before.\nWhen we were finished with everything else, Auri brought out a small, bright knife and divided the cinnas fruit into three parts. As soon as she broke the skin of it, I could smell it on the air, sweet and sharp. It made my mouth water. Cinnas fruit came from a long way off and was simply too expensive for people like me.", "She held out my piece and I took it from her gently. \u201cThank you kindly, Auri.\u201d\n\u201cYou are welcome kindly, Kvothe.\u201d\nElodin looked back and forth between the two of us. \u201cAuri?\u201d\nI waited for him to finish his question, but that seemed to be all of it.\nAuri understood before I did. \u201cIt\u2019s my name,\u201d she said, grinning proudly. \u201cIs it now?\u201d Elodin said curiously.\nAuri nodded. \u201cKvothe gave it to me.\u201d She beamed in my direction. \u201cIsn\u2019t it\nmarvelous?\u201d\nElodin nodded. \u201cIt is a lovely name,\u201d he said politely. \u201cAnd it suits you.\u201d \u201cIt does,\u201d she agreed. \u201cIt is like having a flower in my heart.\u201d She gave\nElodin a serious look. \u201cIf your name is getting too heavy, you should have Kvothe give you a new one.\u201d\nElodin nodded again and took a bite of his cinnas. As he chewed, he turned to look at me. By the light of the moon, I saw his eyes. They were cool, thoughtful, and perfectly, utterly sane.\nAfter we finished our dinner, I sang a few songs, and we said our good-byes. Elodin and I walked away together. I knew at least a half-dozen ways to climb down from the roof of Mains, but I let him take the lead.\nWe made our way past a round stone observatory that stuck up from the roof and moved onto a long stretch of reasonably flat lead sheeting.\n\u201cHow long have you been coming to see her?\u201d Elodin asked.\nI thought about it. \u201cHalf a year? It depends on when you start counting. It took a couple span of playing before I caught a glimpse of her, more before she trusted me enough to talk.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had better luck than I have,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been years. This is the first time she\u2019s come within ten paces of me. We barely speak a dozen words on a good day.\u201d\nWe climbed over a wide, low chimney and back onto a gentle slope of thick timber sealed with layers of tar. As we walked I grew more anxious. Why had he been trying to get close to her?\nI thought about the time I had gone to Haven with Elodin to visit his giller, Alder Whin. I thought about Auri there. Tiny Auri, strapped to a bed with\n \nthick leather belts so she couldn\u2019t hurt herself or thrash around while she was being fed.\nI stopped walking. Elodin took a few more steps before turning to look at me.\n\u201cShe\u2019s my friend,\u201d I said slowly.\nHe nodded. \u201cThat much is obvious.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t have enough friends that I could bear to lose one,\u201d I said.\n\u201cNot her. Promise me you won\u2019t tell anyone about her or bundle her off to Haven. It\u2019s not the right place for her.\u201d I swallowed against the dryness in my throat. \u201cI need you to promise me.\u201d\nElodin tilted his head to one side. \u201cI\u2019m hearing an or else,\u201d he said, amusement in his voice. \u201cEven though you\u2019re not actually saying it. I need to promise you or else. . . .\u201d One corner of his mouth quirked up in a wry little smile.\nWhen he smiled, I felt a flash of anger mingled with anxiety and fear. It was followed by the sudden, hot taste of plum and nutmeg in my mouth, and I became very conscious of the knife I had strapped to my thigh underneath my pants. I felt my hand slowly sliding into my pocket.\nThen I saw the edge of the roof a half-dozen feet behind Elodin, and I felt my feet shift slightly, getting ready to sprint and tackle him, bearing us both off the roof and down to the hard cobblestones below.\nI felt a sudden, cold sweat sweep over my body and closed my eyes. I took a deep, slow breath and the taste in my mouth faded.\nI opened my eyes again. \u201cI need you to promise me,\u201d I said. \u201cOr else I\u2019ll probably do something stupid beyond all mortal ken.\u201d I swallowed. \u201cAnd both of us will end up the worse for it.\u201d\nElodin looked at me. \u201cWhat a remarkably honest threat,\u201d he said. \u201cNormally they\u2019re much more growlish and gristly than that.\u201d\n\u201cGristly?\u201d I asked, emphasizing the \u2018t.\u2019 \u201cDon\u2019t you mean grisly?\u201d\n\u201cBoth,\u201d he said. \u201cUsually there\u2019s a lot of, I\u2019ll break your knees. I\u2019ll break your neck.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cMakes me think of gristle, like when you\u2019re boning a chicken.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d I said. \u201cI see.\u201d\nWe stared at each other for a moment.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to send anyone to take her in,\u201d he said at last. \u201cHaven is the\nproper place for some folk. It\u2019s the only place for a lot of them. But I wouldn\u2019t wish a mad dog locked there if there were a better option.\u201d", "He turned and started to walk away. When I didn\u2019t follow, he turned to look back at me.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not good enough,\u201d I said. \u201cI need you to promise.\u201d\n\u201cI swear on my mother\u2019s milk,\u201d Elodin said. \u201cI swear on my name and my power. I swear it by the ever-moving moon.\u201d\nWe started walking again.\n\u201cShe needs warmer clothes,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd socks and shoes. And a blanket. And they need to be new. Auri won\u2019t take anything that\u2019s been worn by anyone else. I\u2019ve tried.\u201d\n\u201cShe won\u2019t take them from me,\u201d Elodin said. \u201cI\u2019ve left things out for her. She won\u2019t touch them.\u201d He turned to look at me. \u201cIf I give them to you, will you pass them along?\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cIn that case she also needs about twenty talents, a ruby the size of an egg, and a new set of engraving tools.\u201d\nElodin gave an honest, earthy chuckle. \u201cDoes she also need lute strings?\u201d I nodded. \u201cTwo pair, if you can get them.\u201d\n\u201cWhy Auri?\u201d Elodin asked.\n\u201cBecause she doesn\u2019t have anyone else,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd neither do I. If we\ndon\u2019t look out for each other, who will?\u201d\nHe shook his head. \u201cNo. Why did you pick that name for her?\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d I said, embarrassed. \u201cBecause she\u2019s so bright and sweet. She doesn\u2019t\nhave any reason to be, but she is. Auri means sunny.\u201d\n\u201cIn what language?\u201d he asked.\nI hesitated. \u201cSiaru, I think.\u201d\nElodin shook his head. \u201cSunny is leviriet in Siaru.\u201d\nI tried to think where I\u2019d learned the word. Had I stumbled onto it in the\nArchives. . .?\nBefore I could bring it to mind, Elodin spoke. \u201cI am preparing to teach a\nclass,\u201d he said casually, \u201cfor those interested in the delicate and subtle art of naming.\u201d He gave me a sideways look. \u201cIt occurs to me that it might not be a complete waste of your time.\u201d\n\u201cI might be interested,\u201d I said carefully.\nHe nodded. \u201cYou should read Teccam\u2019s Underlying Principles to prepare. Not a long book, but thick, if you follow me.\u201d\n\u201cIf you lend me a copy, I\u2019d like nothing better than to read it,\u201d I said. \u201cOtherwise, I\u2019ll have to muddle through without.\u201d He looked at me, uncomprehending. \u201cI\u2019ve been banned from the Archives.\u201d", "\u201cWhat, still?\u201d Elodin asked, surprised.\n\u201cStill.\u201d\nHe seemed indignant. \u201cIt\u2019s been what? Half a year?\u201d\n\u201cThree quarters of a year in three days\u2019 time,\u201d I said. \u201cMaster Lorren has\nmade his feelings clear on the issue of letting me back inside.\u201d\n\u201cThat,\u201d Elodin said with a strange protectiveness in his voice, \u201cis utter\nhorseshit. You\u2019re my Re\u2019lar now.\u201d\nElodin changed directions, heading over a piece of rooftop I usually\navoided because it was covered in clay roofing tiles. From there we hopped a narrow alley, made our way across the sloping roof of an inn, and stepped onto a broad roof of finished stone.\nEventually we came to a wide window with the warm glow of candlelight behind it. Elodin knocked on a pane of glass as sharply as if it were a door. Looking around, I realized we were standing atop the Masters\u2019 Hall.\nAfter a moment, I saw the tall, thin shape of Master Lorren block the candlelight behind the window. He worked the latch and the entire window swung open on a hinge.\n\u201cElodin, what can I do for you?\u201d Lorren asked. If he thought anything odd about the situation, I couldn\u2019t tell from looking at his face.\nElodin jerked a thumb over his shoulder at me. \u201cThe boy here says he\u2019s still banned from the Archives. Is that so?\u201d\nLorren\u2019s impassive eyes moved to me, then back to Elodin. \u201cIt is.\u201d\n\u201cWell let him back in,\u201d Elodin said. \u201cHe needs to read things. You\u2019ve made your point.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s reckless,\u201d Lorren said flatly. \u201cI\u2019d planned to keep him out for a year and a day.\u201d\nElodin sighed. \u201cYes yes, very traditional. Why don\u2019t you give him a second chance? I\u2019ll vouch for him.\u201d\nLorren eyed me for a long moment. I tried to look as responsible as I could, which wasn\u2019t very, considering I was standing on a rooftop in the middle of the night.\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Lorren said. \u201cTomes only.\u201d\n\u201cTombs is for feckless tits who can\u2019t chew their own food,\u201d Elodin said dismissively. \u201cMy boy\u2019s a Re\u2019lar. He has the feck of twenty men! He needs to explore the Stacks and discover all manner of useless things.\u201d\n\u201cI am not concerned about the boy,\u201d Lorren said with unblinking calm. \u201cMy concern is for the Archives itself.\u201d", "Elodin reached out and grabbed me by the shoulder, pushing me forward a bit. \u201cHow about this? If you catch him larking around again, I\u2019ll let you cut off his thumbs. That should set an example, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\nLorren gave the two of us a slow look. Then he nodded. \u201cVery well,\u201d he said, and closed his window.\n\u201cThere you go,\u201d Elodin said expansively.\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I demanded, wringing my hands. \u201cI ... What the hell?\u201d Elodin looked at me, puzzled. \u201cWhat? You\u2019re in. Problem solved.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t offer to let him cut off my thumbs!\u201d I said.\nHe raised an eyebrow. \u201cAre you planning on breaking the rules again?\u201d He\nasked pointedly.\n\u201cWh\u2014No. But . . .\u201d\n\u201cThen you don\u2019t have anything to worry about,\u201d he said. He turned and\ncontinued up the slope of the roof. \u201cProbably. I\u2019d still step carefully if I were you. I can never tell when Lorren is kidding.\u201d\nAs soon as I awoke the next day, I made my way to the office of the bursar and settled accounts with Riem, the pinch-faced man who held the University\u2019s purse strings. I paid my hard-won nine talents and five, securing my place in the University for one more term.\nNext I went to Ledgers and Lists where I signed up for observation in the Medica along with Physiognomy and Physic. Next was Ferrous and Cupric Metallurgy with Cammar in the Fishery. Last came Adept Sympathy with Elxa Dal.\nIt was only then I realized I didn\u2019t know the name of Elodin\u2019s class. I leafed through the ledger until I spotted Elodin\u2019s name, then ran my finger back to where the title of the class was listed in fresh dark ink: \u201cIntroduction to Not Being a Stupid Jackass.\u201d\nI sighed and penned my name in the single blank space beneath.\n \n"], "CHAPTER TWELVE": ["CHAPTER TWELVE\nThe Sleeping Mind\nWHEN I STIRRED AWAKE the next day, my first thought was of Elodin\u2019s class. There was an excited flutter in my stomach. After long months of trying to get Master Namer to teach me, I was finally going to get a chance to study naming. Real magic. Taborlin the Great magic.\nBut work came before play. Elodin\u2019s class didn\u2019t meet until noon. With Devi\u2019s debt hanging over my head, I needed to squeeze in a couple hours\u2019 work at the Fishery.\nEntering Kilvin\u2019s workshop, the familiar din of a half-hundred busy hands washed over me like music. While it was a dangerous place, I found the workshop oddly relaxing. Many students resented my quick rise through the ranks of the Arcanum, but I\u2019d earned a grudging respect from most of the other artificers.\nI saw Manet working near the kilns and started to wind my way through the busy worktables toward him. Manet always knew what work paid best.\n\u201cKvothe!\u201d\nThe huge room grew quiet, and I turned to see Master Kilvin standing in the doorway of his office. He made a curt beckoning gesture and stepped back inside his office.\nSound slowly filled the room as the students returned to their work, but I could feel their eyes on me as I made my way across the room, weaving between the worktables.\nAs I came closer, I saw Kilvin through the wide window of his office, writing on a wall-mounted slate. He was half a foot taller than me, with a chest like a barrel. His great bristling beard and dark eyes made him look even larger than he really was.\n \nI knocked politely on the doorframe, and Kilvin turned, setting down his chalk. \u201cRe\u2019lar Kvothe. Come in. Close the door.\u201d\nAnxiously, I stepped into the room and pulled the door shut behind me. The clatter and din of the workshop was cut off so completely that I expected Kilvin must have some cunning sygaldry in place that muffled the noise. The result was an almost eerie quiet in the room.\nKilvin picked up a piece of paper from the corner of his worktable. \u201cI have heard a distressing thing,\u201d he said. \u201cSeveral days ago, a girl came to Stocks. She was looking for a young man who had sold her a charm.\u201d He looked me in the eye. \u201cDo you know anything about this?\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cWhat did she want?\u201d\n\u201cWe do not know,\u201d Kilvin said. \u201cE\u2019lir Basil was working in Stocks at the time. He said the girl was young and seemed rather distressed. She was looking for\u2014\u201d He glanced down at the paper. \u201c\u2014a young wizard. She didn\u2019t know his name, but described him as being young, red-haired, and pretty.\u201d\nKilvin set down the piece of paper. \u201cBasil said she grew increasingly upset as they spoke. She looked frightened, and when he tried to get her name, she ran off crying.\u201d He crossed his huge arms in front of his chest, his face severe. \u201cSo I ask you plainly. Have you been selling charms to young women?\u201d\nThe question caught me by surprise. \u201cCharms?\u201d I asked. \u201cCharms for what?\u201d\n\u201cThat you should tell me,\u201d Kilvin said darkly. \u201cCharms for love, or luck. To help a woman catch with child, or to prevent the same. Amulets against demons and the like.\u201d\n\u201cCan such things be made?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Kilvin said firmly. \u201cWhich is why we do not sell them.\u201d His dark eyes settled heavily onto me. \u201cSo I ask you again: have you been selling charms to ignorant townsfolk?\u201d\nI was so unprepared for the accusation that I couldn\u2019t think of anything sensible to say in my defense. Then the ridiculousness of it struck me and I burst out laughing.\nKilvin\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cThis is not amusing, Re\u2019lar Kvothe. Not only are such things expressly forbidden by the University, but a student who would sell false charms . . .\u201d Kilvin trailed off, shaking his head. \u201cIt reveals a profound flaw of character.\u201d\n\u201cMaster Kilvin, look at me,\u201d I said, plucking at my shirt. \u201cIf I was tricking", "gullible townsfolk out of their money, I wouldn\u2019t have to wear secondhand homespun.\u201d\nKilvin looked over, as if noticing my clothes for the first time. \u201cTrue,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, one might think a student of lesser means would be more tempted to such actions.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought of it,\u201d I admitted. \u201cWith a penny\u2019s worth of iron and ten minutes easy sygaldry I could make a pendant that was cold to the touch. It wouldn\u2019t be hard to sell such a thing.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cBut I\u2019m well aware that would fall under Fraudulent Purveyance. I wouldn\u2019t risk that.\u201d\nKilvin frowned. \u201cA member of the Arcanum avoids such behavior because it is wrong, Re\u2019lar Kvothe. Not because there is too much risk.\u201d\nI gave him a forlorn smile. \u201cMaster Kilvin, if you had that much faith in my moral grounding we wouldn\u2019t be having this conversation.\u201d\nHis expression softened a little, and he gave me a small smile. \u201cI admit, I would not expect such of you. But I have been surprised before. I would be remiss in my duty if I did not investigate such things.\u201d\n\u201cDid this girl come to complain about the charm?\u201d I asked.\nKilvin shook his head. \u201cNo. As I said, she left no message. But I am at a loss as to why else a distressed young girl with a charm would come looking for you, knowing your description but not your name.\u201d He raised an eyebrow at me, making it a question.\nI sighed. \u201cDo you want my honest opinion, Master Kilvin?\u201d\nKilvin raised both eyebrows at that. \u201cAlways, Re\u2019lar Kvothe.\u201d\n\u201cI expect someone is trying to get me into trouble,\u201d I said. Compared to\ndosing me with an alchemical poison, spreading rumors was practically genteel behavior for Ambrose.\nKilvin nodded, absentmindedly smoothing down his beard with one hand. \u201cYes. I see.\u201d\nHe shrugged and picked up his piece of chalk. \u201cWell then. I consider this matter resolved for the moment.\u201d He turned back to the slate and glanced over his shoulder at me. \u201cI trust I will not be troubled by a horde of pregnant women waving iron pendants and cursing your name?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take steps to avoid that, Master Kilvin.\u201d\n \nI filled a few hours doing piecework in the Fishery, then made my way to the lecture hall in Mains where Elodin\u2019s class was being held. It was scheduled to begin at noon, but I was there a half hour early, the first to arrive.\nThe other students trickled in slowly. Seven of us in all. First came Fenton, my friendly rival from Advanced Sympathy. Then Fela arrived with Brean, a pretty girl of about twenty with sandy hair cut in the fashion of a boy\u2019s.\nWe chatted and introduced ourselves. Jarret was a shy Modegan I\u2019d seen in the Medica. I recognized the young woman with bright blue eyes and honey- colored hair as Inyssa, but it took me a while to remember where I\u2019d met her. She was one of Simmon\u2019s countless short-lived relationships. Last was Uresh, nearly thirty and a full El\u2019the. His complexion and accent marked him as coming all the way from the Lanett.\nThe noon bell struck, but Elodin was nowhere to be seen.\nFive minutes passed. Then ten. It wasn\u2019t until half past noon that Elodin breezed into the hall, carrying a loose armful of papers. He dropped them onto a table and began to pace back and forth directly in front of us.\n\u201cSeveral things should be made perfectly clear before we start,\u201d he said without any introduction or apology for his lateness. \u201cFirst, you must do as I say. You must do it to the best of your ability, even when you don\u2019t see the reasons for it. Questions are fine, but in the end: I say, you do.\u201d He looked around. \u201cYes?\u201d\nWe nodded or murmured affirmative noises.\n\u201cSecond, you must believe me when I tell you certain things. Some of the things I tell you may not be true. But you must believe them anyway, until I tell you to stop.\u201d He looked at each of us, \u201cYes?\u201d\nI wondered vaguely if he began every lecture this way. Elodin noticed the lack of an affirmative from my direction. He glared at me, irritated. \u201cWe aren\u2019t to the hard part yet,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019ll do my best to try,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWith answers like that we\u2019ll make you a barrister in no time,\u201d he said sarcastically. \u201cWhy not just do it, instead of doing your best to try?\u201d\nI nodded. It seemed to appease him and he turned back to the class as a whole. \u201cThere are two things you must remember. First, our names shape us, and we shape our names in turn.\u201d He stopped his pacing and looked out at us. \u201cSecond, even the simplest name is so complex that your mind could never begin to feel the boundaries of it, let alone understand it well enough for you to speak it.\u201d", "There was a long stretch of quiet. Elodin waited, staring at us.\nFinally Fenton took the bait. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, how can anyone be a namer?\u201d\n\u201cGood question,\u201d Elodin said. \u201cThe obvious answer is that it can\u2019t be done. That even the simplest of names is well beyond our reach.\u201d He held up a hand. \u201cRemember, I am not speaking of the small names we use every day. The calling names like \u2018tree\u2019 and \u2018fire\u2019 and \u2018stone.\u2019 I am talking about something else entirely.\u201d\nHe reached into a pocket and pulled out a river stone, smooth and dark. \u201cDescribe the precise shape of this. Tell me of the weight and pressure that forged it from sand and sediment. Tell me how the light reflects from it. Tell me how the world pulls at the mass of it, how the wind cups it as it moves through the air. Tell me how the traces of its iron will feel the calling of a loden-stone. All of these things and a hundred thousand more make up the name of this stone.\u201d He held it out to us at arm\u2019s length. \u201cThis single, simple stone.\u201d\nElodin lowered his hand and looked at us. \u201cCan you see how complex even this simple thing is? If you studied it for a long month, perhaps you would come to know it well enough to glimpse the outward edges of its name. Perhaps.\n\u201cThis is the problem namers face. We must understand things that are beyond our understanding. How can it be done?\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t wait for an answer and instead picked up some of the paper he\u2019d brought in with him, handing each of us several sheets. \u201cIn fifteen minutes I will toss this stone. I will stand here,\u201d he set his feet. \u201cFacing thus.\u201d He squared his shoulders. \u201cI will throw it underhand with about three grip of force behind it. I want you to calculate in what manner it will move through the air so you can have your hand in the proper place to catch it when the time comes.\u201d\nElodin set the stone on a desk. \u201cProceed.\u201d\nI set to the problem with a will. I drew triangles and arcs, I calculated, guessing at formulas I couldn\u2019t quite remember. It wasn\u2019t long before I grew frustrated at the impossibility of the task. Too much was unknown, too much was simply impossible to calculate.\nAfter five minutes on our own, Elodin encouraged us to work as a group. That was when I first saw Uresh\u2019s talent with numbers. His calculations had outstripped mine to such a degree that I couldn\u2019t understand much of what he", "was doing. Fela was much the same, though she had also sketched a detailed series of parabolic arcs.\nThe seven of us discussed, argued, tried, failed, tried again. At the end of fifteen minutes we were frustrated. Myself especially. I hate problems I cannot solve.\nElodin looked to us as a group. \u201cSo what can you tell me?\u201d\nSome of us started to give our half-answers or best guesses, but he waved us into silence. \u201cWhat can you tell me with certainty?\u201d\nAfter a moment Fela spoke up, \u201cWe don\u2019t know how the stone will fall.\u201d\nElodin clapped his hands approvingly. \u201cGood! That is the right answer. Now watch.\u201d\nHe went to the door and stuck his head out. \u201cHenri!\u201d he shouted. \u201cYes you. Come here for a second.\u201d He stepped back from the door and ushered in one of Jamison\u2019s runners, a boy no more than eight years old.\nElodin took a half-dozen steps away and turned to face the boy. He squared his shoulders and grinned a mad grin. \u201cCatch!\u201d he said, lofting the stone at the boy.\nStartled, the boy snatched it out of the air.\nElodin applauded wildly, then congratulated the bewildered boy before reclaiming the stone and hurrying him back out the door.\nOur teacher turned to face us. \u201cSo,\u201d Elodin asked. \u201cHow did he do it? How could he calculate in a second what seven brilliant members of the Arcanum could not figure in a quarter hour? Does he know more geometry than Fela? Are his numbers quicker than Uresh\u2019s? Should we bring him back and make him a Re\u2019lar?\u201d\nWe laughed a bit, relaxing.\n\u201cMy point is this. In each of us there is a mind we use for all our waking deeds. But there is another mind as well, a sleeping mind. It is so powerful that the sleeping mind of an eight-year-old can accomplish in one second what the waking minds of seven members of the Arcanum could not in fifteen minutes.\u201d\nHe made a sweeping gesture. \u201cYour sleeping mind is wide and wild enough to hold the names of things. This I know because sometimes this knowledge bubbles to the surface. Inyssa has spoken the name of iron. Her waking mind does not know it, but her sleeping mind is wiser. Something deep inside Fela understands the name of the stone.\u201d\nElodin pointed at me. \u201cKvothe has called the wind. If we are to believe the", "writings of those long dead, his is the traditional path. The wind was the name aspiring namers sought and caught when things were studied here so long ago.\u201d\nHe went quiet for a moment, looking at us seriously, his arms folded. \u201cI want each of you to think on what name you would like to find. It should be a small name. Something simple: iron or fire, wind or water, wood or stone. It should be something you feel an affinity toward.\u201d\nElodin strode toward the large slate mounted on the wall and began to write a list of titles. His handwriting was surprisingly tidy. \u201cThese are important books,\u201d he said. \u201cRead one of them.\u201d\nAfter a moment, Brean raised her hand. Then she realized it was pointless as Elodin still had his back to us. \u201cMaster Elodin?\u201d she asked hesitantly. \u201cWhich one should we read?\u201d\nHe looked over his shoulder, not pausing in his writing at all. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he said, plainly irritated. \u201cPick one. The others you should skim in a desultory fashion. Look at the pictures. Smell them if nothing else.\u201d He turned back to look at the slate.\nThe seven of us looked at each other. The only sound in the room was the tapping of Elodin\u2019s chalk. \u201cWhich one is the most important?\u201d I asked.\nElodin made a disgusted noise. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t read them.\u201d He wrote En Temerant Voistra on the board and circled it. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if this one is in the Archives at all.\u201d He put a question mark next to it and continued to write. \u201cI will tell you this. None of them are in Tomes. I made sure of that. You\u2019ll have to hunt for them in the Stacks. You\u2019ll have to earn them.\u201d\nHe finished the last title and took a step back, nodding to himself. There were twenty books in all. He drew stars next to three of them, underlined two others, and drew a sad face next to the last one on the list.\nThen he left, striding out of the room without another word, leaving us thinking on the nature of names and wondering what we had gotten ourselves into.", ""], "CHAPTER THIRTEEN": ["CHAPTER THIRTEEN\nThe Hunt\nDETERMINED TO MAKE A good showing of myself in Elodin\u2019s class, I tracked down Wilem and negotiated an exchange of future drinks for his help navigating the Archives.\nWe made our way through the cobbled streets of the University together, the wind gusting as the huge, windowless shape of the Archives loomed above us across the courtyard. The words Vorfelan Rhinata Morie were chiseled into the stone above the massive stone doors.\nAs we came closer, I realized my hands were sweaty. \u201cLord and lady, hold on for a second.\u201d I said as I stopped walking.\nWil raised an eyebrow at me.\n\u201cI\u2019m nervous as a new whore,\u201d I said. \u201cJust give me a moment.\u201d \u201cYou said Lorren lifted his ban two days ago,\u201d Wilem said. \u201cI thought\nyou\u2019d be inside as soon as you had permission.\u201d\n\u201cI was waiting for them to update the ledgers.\u201d I wiped my damp hands on\nmy shirt. \u201cI know something\u2019s going to happen,\u201d I said anxiously. \u201cMy name won\u2019t be in the book. Or Ambrose will be at the desk and I\u2019ll have some sort of relapse from that plum drug and end up kneeling on his throat and screaming.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see that,\u201d Wil said. \u201cBut Ambrose doesn\u2019t work today.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s something,\u201d I admitted, relaxing a bit. I pointed to the words above the door. \u201cDo you know what that means?\u201d\nWil glanced up. \u201cThe desire for knowledge shapes a man,\u201d he said. \u201cOr something close to that.\u201d\n\u201cI like that.\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cRight. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\nI pulled open the huge stone doors and entered a small antechamber, then Wil tugged open the inner doors and we stepped into the entry hall. In the middle of the room was a huge wooden desk with several large, leather- bound ledgers open atop it. Several imposing doors led off in different directions.", "Fela sat behind the desk, her curling hair pulled back into a tail. The red light from the sympathy lamps made her look different, but no less pretty. She smiled.\n\u201cHello Fela,\u201d I said, trying not to sound as nervous as I felt. \u201cI heard I\u2019m back in Lorren\u2019s good books. Could you check for me?\u201d\nShe nodded and began to flip through the ledger in front of her. Her face brightened, and she pointed. Then her expression went dark.\nI felt a sinking sensation in my stomach, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\u201cYou look like something\u2019s wrong, \u201dWil grumbled. \u201cWhat does it say?\u201d Fela hesitated, then spun the book around so we could read it: Kvothe,\nArliden\u2019s son. Red-haired. Fair complected. Young. Written next to this in the margin in a different script were the words, Ruh Bastard.\nI grinned at her. \u201cCorrect on all counts. Can I go in?\u201d\nShe nodded. \u201cDo you need lamps?\u201d she asked, opening a drawer.\n\u201cI do,\u201d Wil said, already writing his name in a separate ledger.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got my own,\u201d I said, pulling my small lamp from a pocket of my\ncloak.\nFela opened the admittance ledger and signed us in. My hand shook as I\nwrote, skittering the pen\u2019s nib embarrassingly, so it flicked ink across the page.\nFela blotted it away and closed the book. She smiled up at me. \u201cWelcome back,\u201d she said.\nI let Wilem lead the way through the Stacks and did my best to look properly amazed.\nIt wasn\u2019t a hard part to play. While I\u2019d had access to the Archives for some time, I\u2019d been forced to creep around like a thief. I had kept my lamp on its dimmest setting and avoided the main hallways for fear of accidentally running into someone.\nShelves covered every bit of the stone walls. Some hallways were broad and open with high ceilings, while others formed narrow lanes barely wide enough for two people to pass if they both turned sideways. The air was\n \nheavy with the smell of leather and dust, of old parchment and binding glue. It smelled of secrets.\nWilem led me through twisting shelves, up some stairs then through a long, wide hallway lined with books bound all in identical red leather. Finally we came to a door with dim red light showing around the edges.\n\u201cThere are rooms set aside for private study,\u201d Wilem said softly. \u201cReading holes. Sim and I use this one a lot. Not many people know about it.\u201d Wil knocked briefly on the door before he opened it to reveal a windowless room barely larger than the table and chairs it contained.\nSim sat at the table, the red light of his sympathy lamp making his face look ruddier than usual. His eyes grew wide when he saw me. \u201cKvothe? What are you doing in here?\u201d He turned to Wilem, horrified. \u201cWhat is he doing in here?\u201d\n\u201cLorren lifted his ban, \u201dWilem said. \u201cOur young boy has a reading list. He\u2019s planning his first book hunt.\u201d\n\u201cCongratulations!\u201d Sim beamed at me. \u201cCan I help? I\u2019m falling asleep here.\u201d He held out his hand.\nI tapped my temple. \u201cThe day I can\u2019t memorize twenty titles is the day I don\u2019t belong in the Arcanum,\u201d I said. Though that was only half the truth. The full truth was that I only owned a half-dozen precious sheets of paper. I couldn\u2019t afford to waste one on something like this.\nSim pulled a folded piece of paper out of his pocket along with a nub of pencil. \u201cI need things written down,\u201d he said. \u201cNot all of us memorize ballads for fun.\u201d\nI shrugged and began to jot them down. \u201cIt will probably go faster if we split my list three ways,\u201d I said.\nWilem gave me a look. \u201cYou think you can just walk around and find books by yourself?\u201d He looked at Sim, who was grinning widely.\nOf course. I wasn\u2019t supposed to know anything about the layout of the Stacks. Wil and Sim didn\u2019t know I\u2019d been sneaking in at nights for almost a month.\nIt\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t trust them, but Sim couldn\u2019t lie to save his life, and Wil worked as a scriv. I didn\u2019t want to force him to choose between my secret and his duty to Master Lorren.\nSo I decided to play dumb. \u201cOh, I\u2019ll muddle through,\u201d I said nonchalantly. \u201cIt can\u2019t be that hard to figure out.\u201d\n\u201cThere are so many books in the Archives,\u201d Wil said slowly, \u201cthat merely", "reading all the titles would take you a full span.\u201d He paused, looking at me intently. \u201cEleven full days without pause for food or sleep.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Sim asked. \u201cThat long?\u201d\nWil nodded. \u201cI worked it out a year ago. It helps stop the E\u2019lir\u2019s mewling when they must wait for me to fetch them a book.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cThere are books without titles too. And scrolls. And clays. And many languages.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a clay?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cClay tablet,\u201d Wil explained. \u201cThey were some of the only things to survive when Caluptena burned. Some have been transcribed, but not all.\u201d\n\u201cAll that\u2019s beside the point,\u201d Sim interjected. \u201cThe problem is the organization.\u201d\n\u201cCataloging,\u201d Wil said. \u201cThere have been many different systems over the years. Some masters prefer one, some prefer another.\u201d He frowned. \u201cSome create their own systems for organizing the books.\u201d\nI laughed. \u201cYou sound like they should be pilloried for it.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Wil grumbled. \u201cI would not weep over such a thing.\u201d\nSim looked at him. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame a master for trying to organize things\nin the best way possible.\u201d\n\u201cI can,\u201d Wilem said. \u201cIf the Archives were organized badly, it would be a\nuniform unpleasantness we could work with. But there have been so many different systems in the last fifty years. Books mislabeled. Titles mistranslated.\u201d\nHe ran his hands through his hair, sounding suddenly weary. \u201cAnd there are always new books coming in, needing to be cataloged. Always the lazy E\u2019lir in Tombs who want us to fetch for them. It is like trying to dig a hole in the bottom of a river.\u201d\n\u201cSo what you\u2019re saying,\u201d I said slowly, \u201cis that you find your time spent as a scriv to be both pleasant and rewarding.\u201d\nSim muffled a laugh in his hands.\n\u201cAnd then there are you people.\u201d Wil looked at me, his voice dangerous and low. \u201cStudents given the freedom in the Stacks. You come in, read half a book, then hide it so you can continue later at your own convenience. \u201dWil\u2019s hands made gripping motions as if clutching at the front of someone\u2019s shirt. Or perhaps a throat. \u201cThen you forget where you have put the book, and it is gone as surely as if you had burned it.\u201d\nWil pointed a finger at me. \u201cIf I ever discover you have done such a thing,\u201d he said, smoldering with anger, \u201cno God will keep you safe from me.\u201d", "I thought guiltily about three books I had hidden in just this way while I was studying for exams. \u201cI promise,\u201d I said. \u201cI won\u2019t ever do that.\u201d Again. Sim stood up from the table, rubbing his hands together briskly. \u201cRight.\nSimply said, it\u2019s a mess in here, but if you stick to the books they have listed in Tolem\u2019s catalog, you should be able to find what you\u2019re looking for. Tolem is the system we use now. Wil and I will show you where they keep the ledgers.\u201d\n\u201cAnd a few other things,\u201d Wil said. \u201cTolem is hardly comprehensive. Some of your books might require deeper digging.\u201d He turned to open the door.\nAs it turned out, only four books on my list were in the Tolem ledgers. After that, we were forced to leave the well-organized parts of the Stacks behind. Wil seemed to take the list as a personal challenge, so I learned a great deal about the Archives that day. Wil took me to the Dead Ledgers, the Backward Stair, the Bottom Wing.\nEven so, at the end of four hours we\u2019d only managed to track down the locations of seven books. Wil seemed frustrated by this, but I thanked him heartily, telling him he\u2019d given me everything I needed to continue the search on my own.\nOver the next several days, I spent almost every free moment I had in the Archives, hunting the books on Elodin\u2019s list. I wanted nothing more than to start this class with my best foot forward, and I was determined to read every book he had given us.\nThe first was a travelogue I found rather enjoyable. The second was some rather bad poetry, but it was short, and I forced my way through by gritting my teeth and occasionally closing one eye so as not to damage the entirety of my brain. Third was a book of rhetorical philosophy, ponderously written.\nThen came a book detailing wildflowers in northern Atur. A fencing manual with some rather confusing illustrations. Another book of poetry, this one thick as a brick and even more self-indulgent than the first.\nIt took hours, but I read them all. I even went so far as to take notes on two of my precious pieces of paper.\nNext came, as near as I could tell, the journal of a madman. While it\n \nsounds interesting, it was really only a headache pressed between covers. The man wrote in a tight script with no spaces between the words. No breaks for paragraphs. No punctuation. No consistent grammar or spelling.\nThat was when I began to skim. The next day when confronted with two books written in Modegan, a series of essays concerning crop rotation and a monograph on Vintish mosaics, I stopped taking notes.\nThe last handful of books I merely flipped through, wondering why Elodin would want us to read a two-hundred-year-old tax ledger from a barony in the Small Kingdoms, an outdated medical text, and a badly translated morality play.\nWhile I quickly lost my fascination with reading Elodin\u2019s books, I still delighted in hunting them down. I irritated more than a few scrivs with my constant questions:Who was in charge of reshelving? Where were the Vintish dictums kept? Who had the keys to the fourth basement scroll storage? Where did the damaged books go while they were waiting to be repaired?\nIn the end, I found nineteen of the books. All of them except En Temerant Voistra. And that one was not from lack of trying. At my best guess, the entire venture took nearly fifty hours of searching and reading.\nI arrived at Elodin\u2019s next class ten minutes early, proud as a priest. I brought my two pages of careful notes, eager to impress Elodin with my dedication and thoroughness.\nAll seven of us showed up for class before the noon bell. The door to the lecture hall was closed, so we stood in the hallway, waiting for Elodin to arrive.\nWe shared stories about our search through the Archives and speculated as to why Elodin considered these books important. Fela had been a scriv for years, and she had only found seventeen of them. Nobody had found En Temerant Voistra, or even a mention of it.\nElodin still hadn\u2019t arrived by the time the noon bell rang, and at fifteen minutes past the hour I grew tired of standing in the hallway and tried the door to the lecture hall. At first the handle didn\u2019t move at all, but when I jiggled it in frustration, the latch turned and the door opened a crack.\n\u201cThought it was locked,\u201d Inyssa said, frowning.\n\u201cJust stuck,\u201d I said, pushing it open.\nWe entered the huge, empty room and walked down the stairs to the front\nrow of seats. On the large slate in front of us, written in Elodin\u2019s oddly tidy handwriting was a single word: \u201cDiscuss.\u201d", "We settled into our seats and waited, but Elodin was nowhere to be seen. We looked at the slate, then at each other, at a loss for what exactly we were supposed to do.\nFrom the looks on everyone\u2019s faces, I wasn\u2019t the only one who was irritated. I\u2019d spent fifty hours digging up his damn useless books. I\u2019d done my part. Why wasn\u2019t he doing his?\nThe seven of us waited for the next two hours, chatting idly, waiting for Elodin to arrive.\nHe didn\u2019t.", ""], "CHAPTER FOURTEEN": ["CHAPTER FOURTEEN\nThe Hidden City\nWHILE THE HOURS I\u2019D wasted hunting for Elodin\u2019s books left me profoundly irritated, I emerged from the experience with a solid working knowledge of the Archives. The most important thing I learned was that it was not merely a warehouse filled with books. The Archives was like a city unto itself. It had roads and winding lanes. It had alleys and shortcuts.\nJust like a city, parts of the Archives teemed with activity. The Scriptorium held rows of desks where scrivs toiled over translations or copied faded texts into new books with fresh, dark ink. The Sorting Hall buzzed with activity as scrivs sifted and reshelved books.\nThe Buggery was not at all what I expected, thank goodness. Instead, it proved to be the place where new books were decontaminated before being added to the collection. Apparently all manner of creatures love books, some devouring parchment and leather, others with a taste for paper or glue. Bookworms were the least of them, and after listening to a few of Wilem\u2019s stories I wanted nothing more than to wash my hands.\nCataloger\u2019s Mew, the Bindery, Bolts, Palimpsest, all of them were busy as beehives, full of quiet, industrious scrivs.\nBut other parts of the Archives were quite the opposite of busy. The acquisitions office, for example, was tiny and perpetually dark. Through the window I could see that one entire wall of the office was nothing but a huge map with cities and roads marked in such detail that it looked like a snarled loom. The map was covered in a layer of clear alchemical lacquer, and there were notes written at various points in red grease pencil, detailing rumors of desirable books and the last known positions of the various acquisition teams.\nTomes was like a great public garden. Any student was free to come and read the books shelved there. Or they could submit a request to the scrivs, who would grudgingly head off into the Stacks to find if not the exact book you wanted, then at least something closely related.\nBut the Stacks comprised the vast majority of the Archives. That was", "where the books actually lived. And just like in any city, there were good neighborhoods and bad.\nIn the good neighborhoods everything was properly organized and cataloged. In these places a ledger-entry would lead you to a book as simply as a pointing finger.\nThen there were the bad neighborhoods. Sections of the Archives that were forgotten, or neglected, or simply too troublesome to deal with at the moment. These were places where books were organized under old catalogs, or under no catalog at all.\nThere were walls of shelves like mouths with missing teeth, where longgone scrivs had cannibalized an old catalog to bring books into whatever system was fashionable at the time. Thirty years ago two entire floors had gone from good neighborhood to bad when the Larkin ledger-books were burned by a rival faction of scrivs.\nAnd, of course, there was the four-plate door. The secret at the heart of the city.\nIt was nice to go strolling in the good neighborhoods. It was pleasant to go looking for a book and find it exactly where it should be. It was easy. Comforting. Quick.\nBut the bad neighborhoods were fascinating. The books there were dusty and disused. When you opened one, you might read words no eyes had touched for hundreds of years. There was treasure there, among the dross.\nIt was in those places I searched for the Chandrian.\nI looked for hours and I looked for days. A large part of the reason I had come to the University was because I wanted to discover the truth about them. Now that I finally had easy access to the Archives, I made up for lost time.\nBut despite my long hours of searching, I found hardly anything at all. There were several books of children\u2019s stories that featured Chandrian engaged in minor mischief like stealing pies and making milk go sour. Others had them bargaining like demons in Aturan morality plays.\nScattered through these stories were a few thin threads of fact, but nothing I didn\u2019t already know. The Chandrian were cursed. Signs showed their presence : blue flame, rot and rust, a chill in the air.\nMy hunt was made more difficult by the fact that I couldn\u2019t ask anyone for help. If word spread that I was spending my time reading children\u2019s stories, it would not improve my reputation.", "More important, one of the few things I knew about the Chandrian was that they worked to viciously repress any knowledge of their own existence. They\u2019d killed my troupe because my father had been writing a song about them. In Trebon they\u2019d destroyed an entire wedding party because some of the guests had seen pictures of them on a piece of ancient pottery.\nGiven these facts, talking about the Chandrian didn\u2019t seem like the wisest course of action.\nSo I did my own searching. After days, I abandoned hope of finding anything so helpful as a book about the Chandrian, or even anything so substantial as a monograph. Still, I read on, hoping to find a scrap of truth hidden somewhere. A single fact. A hint. Anything.\nBut children\u2019s stories are not rich in detail, and what few details I found were obviously fanciful. Where did the Chandrian live? In the clouds. In dreams. In a castle made of candy. What were their signs? Thunder. The darkening of the moon. One story even mentioned rainbows. Who would write that? Why make a child terrified of rainbows?\nNames were easier to come by, but all were obviously stolen from other sources. Almost all of these were names of demons mentioned in the Book of the Path, or from some play, primarily Daeonica. One painfully allegorical story named the Chandrian after seven well-known emperors from the days of the Aturan Empire. That, at least, gave me a brief, bitter laugh.\nEventually I discovered a slim volume called The Book of Secrets buried deep in the Dead Ledgers. It was an odd book: arranged like a bestiary but written like a children\u2019s primer. It had pictures of faerie-tale creatures like ogres, trow, and dennerlings. Each entry had a picture accompanied by a short, insipid poem.\nOf course, the Chandrian were the only entry without a picture. Instead there was just an empty page framed in decorative scrollwork. The accompanying poem was less than useless:\nThe Chandrian move from place to place, But they never leave a trace.\nThey hold their secrets very tight,\nBut they never scratch and they never bite. They never fight and they never fuss.\nIn fact they are quite nice to us.\nThey come and they go in the blink of an eye,", "Like a bright bolt of lightning out of the sky.\nIrritating as it was to read something like this, it made one point abundantly clear. To the rest of the world the Chandrian were nothing more than childish faerie stories. No more real than shamble-men or unicorns.\nI knew differently, of course. I had seen them with my own eyes. I had talked to black-eyed Cinder. I had seen Haliax wearing shadow all around him like a mantle.\nSo I continued my fruitless search. It didn\u2019t matter what the rest of the world believed. I knew the truth, and I\u2019ve never been one to give up easily.\nI settled into the rhythm of a new term. As before, I attended classes and played music at Anker\u2019s. But most of my time was spent in the Archives. I had lusted after them for so long that being able to walk through the front doors any time I wanted seemed almost unnatural.\nEven my continuing failure to find anything factual about the Chandrian didn\u2019t sour the experience. As I hunted, I became increasingly distracted by other books I found. A handwritten medicinal herbal with watercolor pictures of various plants. A small quarto book of four plays I\u2019d never heard of before. A remarkably engaging biography of Hevred the Wary.\nI spent entire afternoons in the reading holes, missing meals and neglecting my friends. More than once I was the last student out of the Archives before the scrivs locked the doors for the night. I would have slept there if such things were allowed.\nSome days, if my schedule was too tight for me to settle in for a long stretch of reading, I would simply walk the Stacks for a handful of minutes between classes.\nI was so infatuated with my new freedoms that I did not make it over the river into Imre for many days. When I did return to the Grey Man, I brought a calling card I\u2019d fashioned from a scrap of parchment. I thought Denna would be amused by it.\nBut when I arrived, the officious porter in the Grey Man\u2019s parlor told me no, he could not deliver my card. No, the young lady was no longer in residence. No, he could not take a message for her. No, he did not know\n \nwhere she had gone.", ""], "CHAPTER FIFTEEN": ["CHAPTER FIFTEEN\nInteresting Fact\nELODIN STRODE INTO THE lecture hall almost an hour late. His clothes were covered in grass stains, and there were dried leaves tangled in his hair. He was grinning.\nToday there were only six of us waiting for him. Jarret hadn\u2019t shown up for the last two classes. Given the scathing comments he\u2019d made before disappearing, I doubted he\u2019d be coming back.\n\u201cNow!\u201d Elodin shouted without preamble. \u201cTell me things!\u201d\nThis was his newest way to waste our time. At the beginning of every lecture he demanded an interesting fact he had never heard before. Of course, Elodin himself was the sole arbiter of what was interesting, and if the first fact you provided didn\u2019t measure up, or if he already knew it, he would demand another, and another, until you finally came up with something that amused him.\nHe pointed at Brean. \u201cGo!\u201d\n\u201cSpiders can breathe underwater,\u201d she said promptly.\nElodin nodded. \u201cGood.\u201d He looked at Fenton.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a river south of Vintas that flows the wrong way,\u201d Fenton said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a saltwater river that runs inland from the Centhe sea.\u201d\nElodin shook his head. \u201cAlready know about that.\u201d\nFenton looked down at a piece of paper. \u201cEmperor Ventoran once passed a\nlaw\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBoring,\u201d Elodin interjected, cutting him off.\n\u201cIf you drink more than two quarts of seawater you\u2019ll throw up?\u201d Fenton\nasked.\nElodin worked his mouth speculatively, as if he were trying to get a piece\nof gristle out of his teeth. Then he gave a satisfied nod. \u201cThat\u2019s a good one.\u201d He pointed to Uresh.\n\u201cYou can divide infinity an infinite number of times, and the resulting pieces will still be infinitely large,\u201d Uresh said in his odd Lenatti accent. \u201cBut", "if you divide a non-infinite number an infinite number of times the resulting pieces are non-infinitely small. Since they are non-infinitely small, but there are an infinite number of them, if you add them back together, their sum is infinite. This implies any number is, in fact, infinite.\u201d\n\u201cWow,\u201d Elodin said after a long pause. He leveled a serious finger at the Lenatti man. \u201cUresh. Your next assignment is to have sex. If you do not know how to do this, see me after class.\u201d He turned to look at Inyssa.\n\u201cThe Yllish people never developed a written language,\u201d she said.\n\u201cNot true,\u201d Elodin said. \u201cThey used a system of woven knots.\u201d He made a complex motion with his hands, as if braiding something. \u201cAnd they were doing it long before we started scratching pictograms on the skins of sheep.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say they lacked recorded language,\u201d Inyssa muttered. \u201cI said written language.\u201d\nElodin managed to convey his vast boredom in a simple shrug.\nInyssa frowned at him. \u201cFine. There\u2019s a type of dog in Sceria that gives birth through a vestigial penis,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWow,\u201d Elodin said. \u201cOkay. Yeah.\u201d He pointed to Fela.\n\u201cEighty years back the Medica discovered how to remove cataracts from eyes,\u201d Fela said.\n\u201cI already know that,\u201d Elodin said, waving his hand dismissively.\n\u201cLet me finish,\u201d Fela said. \u201cWhen they figured out how to do this, it meant they could restore sight to people who had never been able to see before. These people hadn\u2019t gone blind, they had been born blind.\u201d\nElodin cocked his head curiously.\nFela continued. \u201cAfter they could see, they were shown objects. A ball, a cube, and a pyramid all sitting on a table.\u201d Fela made the shapes with her hands as she spoke. \u201cThen the physickers asked them which one of the three objects was round.\u201d\nFela paused for effect, looking at all of us. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t tell just by looking at them. They needed to touch them first. Only after they touched the ball did they realize it was the round one.\u201d\nElodin threw his head back and laughed delightedly. \u201cReally?\u201d he asked her.\nShe nodded.\n\u201cFela wins the prize!\u201d Elodin shouted, throwing up his hands. He reached into his pocket and brought out something brown and oblong, pressing it into her hands.", "She looked at it curiously. It was a milkweed pod.\n\u201cKvothe hasn\u2019t gone yet,\u201d Brean said.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Elodin said in an offhand way. \u201cKvothe is crap at\nInteresting Fact.\u201d\nI scowled as loudly as I could.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Elodin said. \u201cTell me what you have.\u201d\n\u201cThe Adem mercenaries have a secret art called the Lethani,\u201d I said. \u201cIt is\nthe key to what makes them such fierce warriors.\u201d\nElodin cocked his head to one side. \u201cReally?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said flippantly, hoping to irritate him. \u201cLike I said, it\u2019s\nsecret.\u201d\nElodin seemed to consider this for a moment, then shook his head. \u201cNo.\nInteresting, but not a fact. It\u2019s like saying the Cealdish moneylenders have a secret art called Financia that makes them such fierce bankers. There\u2019s no substance to it.\u201d He looked at me again, expectantly.\nI tried to think of something else, but I couldn\u2019t. My head was full of faerie tales and dead-ended research into the Chandrian.\n\u201cSee?\u201d Elodin said to Brean. \u201cHe\u2019s crap.\u201d\n\u201cI just don\u2019t know why we\u2019re wasting our time with this,\u201d I snapped.\n\u201cDo you have better things to do?\u201d Elodin asked.\n\u201cYes!\u201d I exploded angrily. \u201cI have a thousand more important things to do!\nLike learning about the name of the wind!\u201d\nElodin held up a finger, attempting to strike a sage pose and failing\nbecause of the leaves in his hair. \u201cSmall facts lead to great knowing,\u201d he intoned. \u201cJust as small names lead to large names.\u201d\nHe clapped his hands and rubbed them together eagerly. \u201cRight! Fela! Open your prize and we can give Kvothe the lesson he so greatly desires.\u201d\nFela cracked the dry husk of the milkweed pod. The white fluff of the floating seeds spilled out into her hands.\nMaster Namer motioned for her to toss it into the air. Fela threw it, and everyone watched the mass of white fluff sail toward the high ceiling of the lecture hall, then fall back heavily to the ground.\n\u201cGoddammit,\u201d Elodin said. He stalked over to the bundle of seeds, picked it up, and waved it around vigorously until the air was full of gently floating puffs of milkweed seed.\nThen Elodin started to chase the seeds wildly around the room, trying to snatch them out of the air with his hands. He clambered over chairs, ran", "across the lecturer\u2019s dais, and jumped onto the table at the front of the room. All the while he grabbed at the seeds. At first he did it one-handed, like you\u2019d catch a ball. But he met with no success, and so he started clapping at\nthem, the way you\u2019d swat a fly. When this didn\u2019t work either, he tried to catch them with both hands, the way a child might cup a firefly out of the air.\nBut he couldn\u2019t get hold of one. The more he chased, the more frantic he became, the faster he ran, the wilder he grabbed. This went on for a full minute. Two minutes. Five minutes. Ten.\nIt might have gone on for the entire class period, but eventually he tripped over a chair and tumbled painfully to the stone floor, tearing open the leg of his pants and bloodying his knee.\nClutching his leg, he sat on the ground and let loose with a string of angry cursing the like of which I had never heard in my entire life. He shouted and snarled and spat. He moved through at least eight languages, and even when I couldn\u2019t understand the words he used, the sound of it made my gut clench and the hair on my arms stand up. He said things that made me sweat. He said things that made me sick. He said things I didn\u2019t know it was possible to say.\nI expect this might have continued, but while drawing an angry breath, he sucked one of the floating milkweed seeds into his mouth and began to cough and choke violently.\nEventually he spat out the seed, caught his breath, got to his feet, and limped out of the lecture hall without saying another word.\nThis was not a particularly odd day\u2019s class under Master Elodin.\nAfter Elodin\u2019s class I ate a bit of lunch at Anker\u2019s, then went to my shift in the Medica, watching more experienced El\u2019the diagnose and treat incoming patients. After that I headed over the river with the hope of finding Denna. It was my third trip in as many days, but it was a crisp, sunny day, and after all my time in the Archives, I felt the need to stretch my legs a bit.\nI stopped at the Eolian first, though it was far too early for Denna to be there. I chatted with Stanchion and Deoch before moving on to a few of the other inns I knew she occasionally frequented: Taps, Barrel and Bale, and Dog in the Wall. She wasn\u2019t at any of those either.\n \nI wandered through a few public gardens, their trees almost entirely devoid of leaves. Then I visited all the instrument shops I could find, browsing the lutes and asking if they\u2019d seen a pretty dark-haired woman looking at harps. They hadn\u2019t.\nIt was fully dark by then. So I stopped by the Eolian again and wandered slowly through the crowd. Denna was still nowhere to be seen, but I did meet up with Count Threpe. We shared a drink and listened to a few songs before I left.\nI pulled my cloak more tightly around my shoulders as I started back to the University. Imre\u2019s streets were busier now than they had been during the day, and despite the chill in the air, there was a festival feel to the town. Music of a dozen different kinds poured from the doorways of inns and theaters. People crowded in and out of restaurants and exhibition halls.\nThen I heard a laugh rise high and bright over the low murmuring of the crowds. I would have recognized it anywhere. It was Denna\u2019s laugh. I knew it like the backs of my own hands.\nI turned around, feeling a smile spread across my face. This was always the way of it. I only seemed to be able to find her after I\u2019d given up hope.\nI scanned the faces in the milling throng and found her easily. Denna stood by the doorway of a small caf\u00e9, wearing a long dress of dark blue velvet.\nI took a step toward her, then stopped. I watched as Denna spoke to someone standing behind the open door of a carriage. The only part of her companion I could see was the very top of his head. He was wearing a hat with a tall white plume.\nA moment later, Ambrose closed the carriage door. He gave her a wide, charming smile and said something that made her laugh. Lamplight glittered on the gold brocade of his jacket, and his gloves were dyed the same dark, royal purple as his boots. The color should have looked garish on him, but it didn\u2019t.\nAs I stood staring, a passing two-horse fetter cart nearly knocked me flat and trampled me, which would have been fair, as I was standing in the middle of the road. The driver cursed and flicked out with his horse whip as he went past. It caught me on the back of the neck, but I didn\u2019t even feel it.\nI regained my balance and looked up in time to see Ambrose kiss Denna\u2019s hand. Then, moving gracefully, he offered her his arm and they entered the caf\u00e9, together.", ""], "CHAPTER SIXTEEN": ["CHAPTER SIXTEEN\nUnspoken Fear\nAFTER SEEING AMBROSE AND Denna in Imre, I fell into a dark mood. On the walk back to the University my head spun with thoughts of them. Was Ambrose doing this purely out of spite? How had it happened? What was Denna thinking?\nAfter a largely sleepless night, I tried not to think of it. Instead I burrowed deep into the Archives. Books are a poor substitute for female companionship, but they are easier to find. I consoled myself by hunting through the dark corners of the Archives for the Chandrian. I read until my eyes burned and my head felt thick and cramped.\nNearly a span passed, and I did little but attend classes and pillage the Archives. For my pains I gained lungs full of dust, a persistent headache from hours of reading by sympathy light, and a knot between my shoulder blades from hunching over a low table while I paged through the faded remains of the Gilean ledgers.\nI also found a single mention of the Chandrian. It was in a handwritten octavo titled A Quainte Compendium of Folke Belief.At my best guess, the book was two hundred years old.\nThe book was a collection of stories and superstitions gathered by an amateur historian in Vintas. Unlike The Mating Habits of the Common Draccus, it made no attempt to prove or disprove these beliefs. The author had simply collected and organized the stories with occasional brief commentaries about how beliefs seemed to change from region to region.\nIt was an impressive volume, obviously comprising years of research. There were four chapters about demons. Three chapters for faeries: one of which was entirely devoted to tales of Felurian. There were pages on the shamble-men, rendlings, and the trow. The author recorded songs about the grey ladies and white riders. A lengthy section on barrow draugar. There were six chapters on folk magic: eight ways to cure warts, twelve ways to talk to the dead, twenty-two love charms . . .", "The entire entry on the Chandrian was less than half a page:\nOf the Chaendrian there is little to be said. Every Man knows of them. Every child chants their song. Yet folke tell no stories.\nFor the price of a small beer a Farmer will talk two hours on Dannerlings. But mention the Chaendrian and his mouth goes tight as a Spinner\u2019s Asse and he is touching iron and pushing back his chair.\nMany think it bad luck to speak of the Fae, yet still folke do. What makes the Chaendrian different I knowe notte. One rather drunk Tanner in the towne of Hillesborrow said in hushed tones, \u201cIf you talk of them, they come for you.\u201d This seems the unspoken fear of these common folke.\nSo I write what I have gleaned, all common and inspecific. The Chaendrian are a groupe of various number. (Likely seven, given their name.) They appear and commit diverse violence for no clear reason.\nThere are signs which herald their Arrival, but there is no agreement as to these. Blue flame is the most common, but I have also heard of wine going sour, blindness, crops withering, unseasonable storms, miscarriage, and the sun going dark in the sky.\nAltogether, I have found them a Frustrating and Profitless area of Inquirey.\nI closed the book. Frustrating and profitless had a familiar ring to it.\nThe worst part wasn\u2019t that I already knew everything written in the entry. The worst part was that this was the best source of information I\u2019d managed to discover in over a hundred long hours of searching.", ""], "CHAPTER SEVENTEEN": ["CHAPTER SEVENTEEN\nInterlude\u2014Parts\nKVOTHE HELD UP HIS hand, and Chronicler lifted his pen from the paper. \u201cLet\u2019s pause there for a moment,\u201d Kvothe said, nodding toward the\nwindow. \u201cI can see Cob coming down the road.\u201d\nKvothe stood and brushed off the front of his apron. \u201cMight I suggest the\ntwo of you take a moment to compose yourselves?\u201d He nodded to Chronicler. \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve just been doing something you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\nKvothe walked calmly to stand behind the bar. \u201cNothing could be further from the truth, of course. Chronicler, you are bored, waiting for work. That is why your writing gear is out. You wish you weren\u2019t stuck without a horse in this nowhere town. But you are, and you\u2019re going to make the best of it.\u201d\nBast grinned. \u201cOoh! Give me something, too!\u201d\n\u201cPlay to your strengths, Bast.\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cYou\u2019re drinking with our only customer because you\u2019re a shiftless layabout nobody would ever dream of asking for help in the fields.\u201d\nBast grinned eagerly. \u201cAm I bored too?\u201d\n\u201cOf course you are, Bast. What else is there to be?\u201d He folded the linen cloth and lay it on the bar. \u201cI, on the other hand, am too busy to be bored. I am bustling about, tending to the hundred small tasks that keep the inn running smoothly.\u201d\nHe looked at the two of them. \u201cChronicler, slouch back in your chair. Bast, if you can\u2019t stop grinning, at least start telling our friend the story about the three priests and the miller\u2019s daughter.\u201d\nBast\u2019s grin widened. \u201cThat\u2019s a good one.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone have their parts?\u201d Kvothe picked up the cloth from the bar and walked through the doorway into the kitchen, saying, \u201cEnter Old Cob. Stage left.\u201d\nThere was the thump of feet on the wooden landing, then Old Cob stomped irritably into the Waystone Inn. He glanced past the table where Bast was grinning and making gestures to accompany some story, then made his way", "to the bar. \u201cHello? You in there, Kote?\u201d\nAfter a second the innkeeper came bustling in from the kitchen, drying his\nwet hands on his apron. \u201cHello there, Cob. What can I do for you?\u201d \u201cGraham sent the little Owens boy to fetch me,\u201d Cob said, irritated. \u201cYou\nhave any idea why I\u2019m here instead of haulin\u2019 oats?\u201d\nKote shook his head. \u201cI thought he was bringing in the Murrions\u2019 wheat\ntoday.\u201d\n\u201cDamn foolishness,\u201d Cob muttered. \u201cWe\u2019re in for rain tonight, and I\u2019m\nstanding here with dry oats stacked in my field.\u201d\n\u201cSince you\u2019re here anyway,\u201d the innkeeper said hopefully. \u201cCan I interest\nyou in some cider? Pressed it fresh this morning.\u201d\nSome of the irritation faded from the old man\u2019s weathered face. \u201cSince I\u2019m\nwaiting anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cMug of cider would be proper nice.\u201d\nKote went into the back room and returned with a pottery jug. There was\nthe sound of more feet on the landing outside and Graham came through the door with Jake, Carter, and the smith\u2019s prentice all in tow.\nCob turned to glare at them. \u201cWhat\u2019s so damned important it\u2019s worth hauling me into town this time of morning?\u201d he demanded. \u201cDaylight\u2019s burning, a\u2014\u201d\nThere was a sudden burst of laugher from the table where Chronicler and Bast sat. Everyone turned to see Chronicler flushing a bright red, laughing and covering his mouth with one hand. Bast was laughing too, pounding at the table.\nGraham led the others to the bar. \u201cI found out Carter and the boy are helping the Orrisons take their sheep to market,\u201d he said. \u201cOff to Baedn, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\nCarter and the smith\u2019s prentice nodded.\n\u201cI see.\u201d Old Cob looked down at his hands. \u201cYou\u2019ll be missing his funeral then.\u201d\nCarter nodded solemnly, but Aaron\u2019s expression went stricken. He looked from face to face, but everyone else was standing very still, watching the old farmer by the bar.\n\u201cGood,\u201d Cob said at last, looking up at Graham. \u201cIt\u2019s good you fetched us in.\u201d He saw the boy\u2019s face and snorted. \u201cYou look like you just killed your cat, boy. Mutton goes to market. Shep knew that. He wouldn\u2019t think one jot less of you for doing what needs doing.\u201d\nHe reached up to pat the smith\u2019s prentice on the back. \u201cWe\u2019ll all have a", "drink together to send \u2019im off proper. That\u2019s the important thing. What happens in the church tonight is just a bunch of priestly speechifying. We know how to say good-bye better than that.\u201d He looked behind the bar. \u201cBring us out some of his favorite, Kote.\u201d\nThe innkeeper was already moving, gathering wooden mugs and filling them with a dark brown beer from a smaller keg behind the bar.\nOld Cob held up his mug and the others followed suit. \u201cTo our Shep.\u201d\nGraham spoke first. \u201cWhen we were kids, I broke my leg when we were out hunting,\u201d he said. \u201cI told him to run off for help, but he wouldn\u2019t leave me. He rigged a little sled together out of pure nothing and cussedness. Dragged me the whole way back to town.\u201d\nEveryone drank.\n\u201cHe introduced me to my missus,\u201d Jake said.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I ever thanked him proper for that.\u201d\nEveryone drank.\n\u201cWhen I was sick with the croup, he came out to visit me every day,\u201d Carter said. \u201cNot many folk did. Brought me soup his wife made, too.\u201d\nEveryone drank.\n\u201cHe was nice to me when I first came here,\u201d the smith\u2019s prentice said. \u201cHe would tell me jokes. And once I ruined a wagon couple he\u2019d brought in for me to fix, and he never told Master Caleb.\u201d He swallowed hard and looked around nervously. \u201cI really liked him.\u201d\nEveryone drank.\n\u201cHe was braver than all of us,\u201d Cob said. \u201cHe was the first to stick a knife to that fella last night. If the bastard had been any way normal, that would have been an end to it.\u201d\nCob\u2019s voice shook a bit, and for a moment he looked small and tired and every bit as old as he was. \u201cBut that weren\u2019t the case. These en\u2019t good days to be a brave man. But he was brave all the same. I wish I\u2019d been brave and dead instead, and him home right now, kissing his young wife.\u201d\nThere was a murmur from the others, and they all drank to the bottom of their mugs. Graham coughed a bit before he set his down on the bar.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to say,\u201d the smith\u2019s prentice said softly.\nGraham patted him on the back, smiling. \u201cYou did fine, boy.\u201d\nThe innkeeper cleared his throat, and everyone\u2019s eyes turned to him. \u201cI\nhope you won\u2019t think me too forward,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know him as well as you. Not enough for the first toast, but maybe enough for the second.\u201d He", "fidgeted with his apron strings, as if embarrassed for speaking up at all. \u201cI know it\u2019s early, but I\u2019d dearly like to share a tumble of whiskey with you on Shep\u2019s account.\u201d\nThere was a murmur of assent and the innkeeper pulled glasses from beneath the bar and began to fill them. Not with bottle whiskey either\u2014the red-haired man tapped it from one of the massive barrels resting on the counter behind the bar. Barrel whiskey was a penny a swallow, so they raised their glasses with more earnest warmth than might have otherwise been the case.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this toast going to be then?\u201d Graham asked. \u201cTo the end of a pisser of a year?\u201d Jake said. \u201cThat\u2019s no kind of toast,\u201d Old Cob grumbled at him. \u201cTo the king?\u201d Aaron said.\n\u201cNo,\u201d the innkeeper said, his voice surprisingly firm. He held up his glass. \u201cTo old friends who deserved better than they got.\u201d\nThe men on the other side of the bar nodded solemnly and tossed back their drinks.\n\u201cLord and lady, that\u2019s a lovely tumble,\u201d Old Cob said respectfully, his eyes watering slightly. \u201cYou\u2019re a gentleman, Kote. And I\u2019m glad to know you.\u201d\nThe smith\u2019s prentice set his glass down only to have it tip onto its side and roll across the bar. He snatched it up before it skittered over the edge and turned it over, eyeing its rounded bottom suspiciously.\nJake laughed a loud farmer\u2019s laugh at his bewilderment while Carter made a point of setting his glass on the bar topside-down. \u201cI don\u2019t know how they do it in Rannish,\u201d Carter said to the boy. \u201cBut round here there\u2019s a reason we call it a tumble.\u201d\nThe smith\u2019s prentice looked properly abashed and turned his tumble upside down to match the others on the bar. The innkeeper gave him a reassuring smile before gathering up the glasses and disappearing into the kitchen.\n\u201cRight then,\u201d Old Cob said briskly, rubbing his hands together. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a whole evening of this after the two of you get back from Baedn. But the weather won\u2019t wait on me, and I don\u2019t doubt the Orrisons are eager to be on the road.\u201d\nAfter they filtered out of the Waystone in a loose group, Kvothe emerged from the kitchen and returned to the table where Bast and Chronicler sat.\n\u201cI liked Shep,\u201d Bast said quietly. \u201cCob might be a bit of a crusty old cuss, but he knows what he\u2019s talking about most of the time.\u201d", "\u201cCob doesn\u2019t know half of what he thinks he does,\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cYou saved everyone last night. If not for you, it would have gone through the room like a farmer threshing wheat.\u201d\n\u201cThat just isn\u2019t true, Reshi,\u201d Bast said, his tone plainly offended. \u201cYou would have stopped it. That\u2019s what you do.\u201d\nThe innkeeper shrugged the comment away, unwilling to argue. Bast\u2019s mouth formed into a hard, angry line, his eyes narrowing.\n\u201cStill,\u201d Chronicler said softly, breaking the tension before it grew too thick. \u201cCob was right. It was a brave thing to do. You have to respect that.\u201d\n\u201cNo I don\u2019t,\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cCob was right about that. These aren\u2019t good times to be brave.\u201d He motioned for Chronicler to pick up his pen. \u201cStill, I wish I\u2019d been braver and Shep was home kissing his young wife, too.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER EIGHTEEN": ["CHAPTER EIGHTEEN\nWine and Blood\nEVENTUALLY WIL AND SIM pulled me from the warm embrace of the Archives. I struggled and cursed them, but they were firm in their convictions, and the three of us braved the chill wind on the road to Imre.\nWe made our way to the Eolian, claiming a table near the eastern hearth where we could watch the stage and keep our backs warm. After a drink or two I felt the book-longing fade to a dull ache. The three of us talked and played cards, and eventually I began to enjoy myself despite the fact that Denna was doubtless out there somewhere, hanging on Ambrose\u2019s arm.\nAfter several hours I sat slouched in my chair, drowsy and warm from the nearby fire while Wil and Sim bickered about whether the high king of Modeg was a true ruling monarch or merely a figurehead. I was nearly asleep when a heavy bottle knocked down hard onto our table followed by the delicate chime of wineglasses.\nDenna stood next to our table. \u201cPlay along,\u201d she said under her breath. \u201cYou\u2019ve been waiting for me. I\u2019m late and you\u2019re upset.\u201d\nBlearily, I struggled upright in my seat and tried to blink myself awake.\nSim leaped to the challenge. \u201cIt\u2019s been an hour,\u201d he said, scowling fiercely. He tapped the table firmly with two fingers. \u201cDon\u2019t think buying me a drink is going to fix matters. I want an apology.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not entirely my fault,\u201d Denna said, radiating embarrassment. She turned and gestured to the bar.\nI looked, worried I would see Ambrose standing there, watching me smugly in his goddamn hat. But it was only a balding Cealdish man. He made a short, odd bow toward us, halfway between acknowledgment and apology.\nSim scowled at him, then turned back to Denna and made a grudging gesture to the empty chair across from me. \u201cFine. So are we going to play corners or what?\u201d\nDenna sank down into the chair, sitting with her back to the room. Then leaned over to kiss Simmon on the forehead. \u201cPerfect,\u201d she said.", "\u201cI was scowling too,\u201dWilem said.\nDenna slid him the bottle. \u201cAnd for that, you may pour.\u201d She set the glasses in front of each of us. \u201cA gift from my overly persistent suitor.\u201d She gave an irritated sigh. \u201cThey always need to give you something.\u201d She eyed me speculatively. \u201cYou\u2019re curiously mute.\u201d\nI rubbed a hand over my face. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see you tonight,\u201d I said. \u201cYou caught me nearly napping.\u201d\nWilem poured a pale pink wine then passed around the glasses while Denna examined the etching on the top of the bottle. \u201cCerbeor,\u201d she mused. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if this is a decent vintage.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not, actually,\u201d Simmon said matter-of-factly as he took his glass. \u201cCerbeor is Aturan. Only wines from Vintas have a vintage, technically.\u201d He took a sip.\n\u201cReally?\u201d I asked, looking at my own glass.\nSim nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s a common misuse of the word.\u201d\nDenna took a drink and nodded to herself. \u201cGood wine, though,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIs he still at the bar?\u201d\n\u201cHe is,\u201d I said without looking.\n\u201cWell then,\u201d she smiled. \u201cIt seems you\u2019re stuck with me.\u201d\n\u201cHave you ever played corners?\u201d Sim asked hopefully.\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid not,\u201d Denna said. \u201cBut I\u2019m a quick study.\u201d\nSim explained the rules with help from Wil and myself. Denna asked a few\npointed questions, showing she understood the gist of it. I was glad. Since she was sitting across the table from me, she was going to be my partner.\n\u201cWhat do you usually play for?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cDepends,\u201d Wil said. \u201cSometimes we play by the hand. Sometimes by the set.\u201d\n\u201cFor a set of hands then,\u201d Denna said. \u201cHow much?\u201d\n\u201cWe can do a practice set first,\u201d Sim said, brushing his hair out of his eyes. \u201cSince you\u2019re just learning and all.\u201d\nHer eyes narrowed. \u201cI don\u2019t need any special treatment.\u201d She reached into a pocket and brought a coin up onto the table. \u201cA jot too much for you boys?\u201d\nIt was too much for me, especially with a partner who had just learned the game. \u201cBe careful with these two,\u201d I said. \u201cThey play for blood.\u201d\n\u201cIn point of fact,\u201d Wilem said. \u201cI have no use for blood, and play for money instead.\u201d He fingered through his purse until he found a jot, which he pressed firmly onto the table. \u201cI am willing to play a practice game, but if she", "finds the thought insulting, I will thrash her and take whatever she is willing to lay on the table.\u201d\nDenna grinned at that. \u201cYou\u2019re my kind of guy, Wil.\u201d\nThe first hand went fairly well. Denna mislaid a trick, but we couldn\u2019t have won anyway, as the cards were against us. But the second hand she made a mistake in the bidding. Then, when Sim corrected her, she got flustered and bid wildly. Then she accidentally led out of turn, not a huge mistake, but she led the jack of hearts, which let everyone know exactly what sort of hand she had. She realized it too, and I heard her mutter something distinctly unladylike under her breath.\nTrue to their word, Wil and Sim moved in ruthlessly to take advantage of the situation. Given the weak cards in my hand, there wasn\u2019t much I could do but sit and watch as they won the next two tricks and began to close on her like hungry wolves.\nExcept they couldn\u2019t. She pulled a clever card force, then produced the king of hearts, which didn\u2019t make any sense as she\u2019d tried to lead the jack before. Then she produced the ace, too.\nI realized her fumbling misplay had been an act slightly before Wil and Sim. I managed to keep it off my face until I saw the dim realization creep onto their expressions. Then I started to laugh.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be smug,\u201d she said to me. \u201cI had you fooled, too. You looked like you were going to be sick when I showed the jack.\u201d She put her hand in front of her mouth and made her eyes wide and innocent. \u201cOh my, I\u2019ve never played corners before. Could you teach me? Is it true that sometimes people play for money?\u201d\nDenna snapped down another card onto the table and gathered in the trick. \u201cPlease. You lot should be glad I\u2019m giving you a slap on the hand instead of the profound full-night fleecing you deserve.\u201d\nShe mopped up the rest of the hand relentlessly, and it gave us such a solid lead that the rest of the set was a forgone conclusion. Denna never missed a trick after that, and played with enough cunning flair to make Manet seem like a dray horse by comparison.\n\u201cThat was instructional,\u201d Wil said as he slid his jot toward Denna. \u201cI might need to lick my wounds a bit.\u201d\nDenna lifted her glass in a salute. \u201cTo the gullibility of the well-educated.\u201d We touched our glasses to hers and drank.\n\u201cYou lot have been curiously absent,\u201d Denna said. \u201cI\u2019ve been keeping an", "eye out for you for almost two span.\u201d\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d Sim asked.\nDenna gave Wil and Sim a calculating look. \u201cYou two are students at the\nUniversity too, aren\u2019t you? The special one that teaches magic?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s us,\u201d Sim said agreeably. \u201cWe are chock full of arcane secrets.\u201d \u201cWe tinker with dark forces better left alone,\u201d Wil said nonchalantly. \u201cIt\u2019s called the Arcanum, by the way,\u201d I pointed out.\nDenna nodded seriously as she leaned forward, her expression intent.\n\u201cBetween the three of you, I\u2019m guessing you know how most of it works.\u201d She looked at us. \u201cSo tell me. How does it work?\u201d\n\u201cIt?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cMagic,\u201d she said. \u201cReal magic.\u201d\nWil, Sim, and I exchanged glances.\n\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d I said.\nDenna shrugged and leaned back in her chair. \u201cI have all the time in the\nworld,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I need to know how it works. Show me. Do some magic.\u201d\nThe three of us shifted uncomfortably in our seats. Denna laughed. \u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked. \u201cDoes it disturb some cosmic balance?\u201d\n\u201cIt disturbs the constables,\u201d I said. \u201cThey don\u2019t take kindly to that sort of\nthing over here.\u201d\n\u201cThe masters at the University don\u2019t care for it much either,\u201d Wil said.\n\u201cThey\u2019re very mindful of the University\u2019s reputation.\u201d\n\u201cOh come now,\u201d Denna said. \u201cI heard a story about how our man Kvothe\ncalled up some sort of demon wind.\u201d She jerked her thumb at the door behind her. \u201cRight in the courtyard outside.\u201d\nHad Ambrose told her that? \u201cIt was just a wind,\u201d I said. \u201cNo demon involved.\u201d\n\u201cThey whipped him for it, too,\u201dWil said.\nDenna looked at him as if she couldn\u2019t tell if he were joking, then shrugged. \u201cWell I wouldn\u2019t want to get anyone in trouble,\u201d she said with glaring insincerity. \u201cBut I am powerfully curious. And I have secrets I am willing to offer in trade.\u201d\nSim perked up at this. \u201cWhat sort of secrets?\u201d\n\u201cAll the vast and varied secrets of womankind,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cI happen to know several things that can help improve your failing relations", "with the gentler sex.\u201d\nSim leaned closer to Wil and asked in a stage whisper. \u201cDid she say\nfailing, or flailing?\u201d\nWil pointed at his own chest, then Sim\u2019s. \u201cMe: failing. You: flailing.\u201d Denna raised one eyebrow and cocked her head to one side, looking at the\nthree of us expectantly.\nI cleared my throat uncomfortably. \u201cWe\u2019re discouraged from sharing\nArcanum secrets. It\u2019s not strictly against the laws of the University\u2014\u201d \u201cIt is, actually,\u201d Simmon interrupted, giving me an apologetic look.\n\u201cSeveral laws.\u201d\nDenna gave a dramatic sigh, looking up at the high ceiling. \u201cI thought as\nmuch,\u201d she said. \u201cYou lot just talk a good game. Admit it, you can\u2019t turn cream into butter.\u201d\n\u201cI happen to know for a fact that Sim can turn cream into butter,\u201d I said. \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t like to because he\u2019s lazy.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to teach me magic,\u201d Denna said. \u201cI just need to know how it works.\u201d\nSim looked at Wil. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t fall under Unsanctioned Divulgence, would it?\u201d\n\u201cIllicit Revelation,\u201d Wil said grimly.\nDenna leaned forward conspiratorially, resting her elbows on the table. \u201cIn that case,\u201d she said. \u201cI am also willing to finance a night of extravagant drinking, far above and beyond the simple bottle you see before you.\u201d She turned her gaze to Wil. \u201cOne of the bartenders here has recently discovered a dusty stone bottle in the basement. Not only is it fine old scutten, drink of the kings of Cealdim, it is a Merovani as well.\u201d\nWilem\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change, but his dark eyes glittered.\nI looked around the largely empty room. \u201cOrden is a slow night. We shouldn\u2019t have any trouble if we keep things quiet.\u201d I looked at the other two.\nSim was grinning his boyish grin. \u201cIt seems reasonable. A secret for a secret.\u201d\n\u201cIf it is truly a Merovani,\u201d Wilem said. \u201cI am willing to risk offending the masters\u2019 sensibilities somewhat.\u201d\n\u201cRight then,\u201d Denna said with a wide grin. \u201cYou first.\u201d\nSim leaned forward in his chair. \u201cSympathy is probably the easiest to get a grip on,\u201d he said, then paused as if uncertain how to proceed.\nI stepped in. \u201cYou know how a block and tackle lets you lift something too", "heavy for you to lift by hand?\u201d\nDenna nodded.\n\u201cSympathy lets us do things like that,\u201d I said. \u201cBut without all the awkward\nrope and pulleys.\u201d\nWilem dropped a pair of iron drabs onto the table and muttered a binding.\nHe pushed the right-hand one with a finger, and the left-hand one slid across the table at the same time, mimicking the motion.\nDenna\u2019s eyes went at little wide at this, and while she didn\u2019t gasp, she did draw a long breath through her nose. It only then occurred to me that she\u2019d probably never seen anything like this before. Given my studies, it was easy to forget that someone could live mere miles from the University without ever having any exposure to even the most basic sympathy.\nTo her credit, Denna recovered from her surprise without missing a beat. With only the slightest hesitation, she reached out a finger to touch one of the drabs. \u201cThis is how the bell in my room worked,\u201d she mused.\nI nodded.\nWil slid his drab across the table, and Denna picked it up. The other drab rose off the table too, bobbing in midair. \u201cIt\u2019s heavy,\u201d she said, then nodded to herself. \u201cRight, because it\u2019s like a pulley. I\u2019m lifting both of them.\u201d\n\u201cHeat, light, and motion are all just energy,\u201d I said. \u201cWe can\u2019t create energy or make it disappear. But sympathy lets us move it around or change it from one type into another.\u201d\nShe put the drab back down on the table and the other followed suit. \u201cAnd this is useful how?\u201d\nWil grunted with vague amusement. \u201cIs a waterwheel useful?\u201d he asked. \u201cIs a windmill?\u201d\nI reached into the pocket of my cloak. \u201cHave you ever seen a sympathy lamp?\u201d I asked.\nShe nodded.\nI slid my hand lamp across the table to her. \u201cThey work under the same principle. They take a little bit of heat and turn it into light. It converts one type of energy into another.\u201d\n\u201cLike a moneychanger,\u201d Wil said.\nDenna turned the lamp over in her hands curiously. \u201cWhere does it get the heat?\u201d\n\u201cThe metal itself holds heat,\u201d I explained. \u201cIf you leave it on, you\u2019ll eventually feel the metal get chilly. If it gets too cold, it won\u2019t work.\u201d I", "pointed. \u201cI made that one, so it\u2019s pretty efficient. Just the heat from your hand should be enough to keep it working.\u201d\nDenna flicked the switch and dull red light shone out in a narrow arc. \u201cI can see how heat and light are related,\u201d she said thoughtfully. \u201cThe sun is bright and warm. Same with a candle.\u201d She frowned. \u201cBut motion doesn\u2019t fit into it. A fire can\u2019t push something.\u201d\n\u201cThink about friction,\u201d Sim chimed in. \u201cWhen you rub something it gets hot.\u201d He demonstrated by running his hand back and forth vigorously across the fabric of his pants. \u201cLike this.\u201d\nHe continued rubbing his thigh enthusiastically, unaware of the fact that, since it was happening below the level of the table, it looked more than slightly obscene. \u201cIt\u2019s all just energy. If you keep doing it, you\u2019ll feel it get hot.\u201d\nDenna somehow kept a straight face. But Wilem started to laugh, covering his face with one hand, as if embarrassed to be sitting at the same table with Sim.\nSimmon froze and flushed red with embarrassment.\nI came to his rescue. \u201cIt\u2019s a good example. The hub of a wagon wheel will be warm to the touch. That heat comes from the motion of the wheel. A sympathist can make the energy go the other way, from heat into motion.\u201d I pointed to the lamp. \u201cOr from heat into light.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re energy moneychangers. But how do you make it happen?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a special way of thinking called Alar,\u201d Wilem said. \u201cYou believe something so strongly that it becomes so.\u201d He lifted up one drab and the other followed it. \u201cI believe these two drabs are connected, so they are.\u201d Suddenly the other drab clattered to the tabletop. \u201cIf I stop believing, it stops being so.\u201d\nDenna picked up the drab. \u201cSo it\u2019s like faith?\u201d she said skeptically. \u201cMore like strength of will,\u201d Sim said.\nShe cocked her head. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you call it strength of will, then?\u201d \u201cAlar sounds better,\u201dWilem said.\nI nodded. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have impressive sounding names for things, no one would take us seriously.\u201d\nDenna nodded appreciatively, a smile tugging at the corners of her lovely mouth. \u201cAnd that\u2019s it then? Energy and strength of will?\u201d\n\u201cAnd the sympathetic link,\u201d I said. \u201cWil\u2019s waterwheel analogy is a good one. The link is like a pipe leading to the waterwheel. A bad link is like a", "pipe full of holes.\u201d\n\u201cWhat makes a good link?\u201d Denna asked.\n\u201cThe more similar two objects are, the better the link. Like this.\u201d I poured\nan inch of the pale wine into my cup and dipped my finger into it. \u201cHere is a perfect link to the wine,\u201d I said. \u201cA drop of the wine itself.\u201d\nI stood and walked to the nearby hearth. I murmured a binding and let a drop fall from my finger onto the hot metal andiron holding the burning logs.\nI sat back down just as the wine in my glass started to steam, then boil.\n\u201cAnd that,\u201dWilem said grimly, \u201cis why you never want a sympathist to get a drop of your blood.\u201d\nDenna looked at Wilem, then back to the glass, her face going pale.\n\u201cBlack hands, Wil,\u201d Simmon said with a horrified look. \u201cWhat a thing to say.\u201d He looked at Denna. \u201cNo sympathist would ever do something like that,\u201d he said earnestly. \u201cIt\u2019s called malfeasance, and we don\u2019t do it. Ever.\u201d\nDenna managed a smile, though it was a bit strained. \u201cIf no one ever does it, why is there a name for it?\u201d\n\u201cThey used to,\u201d I said. \u201cBut not anymore. Not for a hundred years.\u201d\nI let the binding go and the wine stopped boiling. Denna reached out and touched the nearby bottle. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t this wine boil too?\u201d she asked, puzzled. \u201cIt\u2019s the same wine.\u201d\nI tapped my temple. \u201cThe Alar. My mind provides the focus and direction.\u201d\n\u201cIf that\u2019s a good link,\u201d she asked, \u201cwhat\u2019s a bad one?\u201d\n\u201cHere, let me show you.\u201d I pulled out my purse, guessing coins would seem less alarming after Wilem\u2019s comment. \u201cSim, do you have a hard penny?\u201d\nHe did, and I arranged two lines of coins on the table in front of Denna. I pointed to a pair of iron drabs and murmured a binding. \u201cLift it up,\u201d I said.\nShe picked up one drab and the other followed it.\nI pointed to the second pair: a drab and my single remaining silver talent. \u201cNow that one.\u201d\nDenna picked up the second drab and the talent followed it into the air. She moved both hands up and down like the arms of a scale. \u201cThis second one\u2019s heavier.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cDifferent metals. They\u2019re less similar, so you have to put more energy into it.\u201d I pointed to the drab and the silver penny and muttered a third binding.", "Denna put the first two drabs into her left hand, and picked up the third in her right. The silver penny followed it into the air. She nodded to herself. \u201cAnd this one\u2019s heavier still because it\u2019s a different shape and a different metal.\u201d\n\u201cExactly,\u201d I said. I pointed to the fourth and final pair: a drab and a piece of chalk.\nDenna almost couldn\u2019t get her fingers underneath the drab to pick it up. \u201cIt\u2019s heavier than all the others together,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be three pounds!\u201d\n\u201cIron to chalk is a lousy link, \u201dWilem said. \u201cBad transference.\u201d\n\u201cBut you said energy couldn\u2019t be created or destroyed,\u201d Denna said. \u201cIf I have to struggle to lift this tiny piece of chalk, where does the extra energy go?\u201d\n\u201cClever,\u201d Wilem chuckled. \u201cSo clever. I went a year before I thought to ask that.\u201d He eyed her in admiration. \u201cSome energy is lost into the air.\u201d He waved one hand. \u201cSome goes into the objects themselves, and some goes into the body of the sympathist who is controlling the link.\u201d He frowned. \u201cThat can get dangerful.\u201d\n\u201cDangerous,\u201d Simmon corrected gently.\nDenna looked at me. \u201cSo right now you\u2019re believing each of these drabs is connected to each of these other things?\u201d\nI nodded.\nShe moved her hands around. The coins and chalk bobbed in the air. \u201cIsn\u2019t that . . . hard?\u201d\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Wilem said. \u201cBut our Kvothe is a bit of a showoff.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve been so quiet,\u201d Sim said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you could hold four bindings at once. That\u2019s impressive as hell.\u201d\n\u201cI can do five if I need to,\u201d I said. \u201cBut that\u2019s pretty much my limit.\u201d\nSim smiled at Denna. \u201cOne more thing. Watch this!\u201d He pointed at the floating piece of chalk.\nNothing happened.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Sim said plaintively. \u201cI\u2019m trying to show her something.\u201d \u201cThen show her,\u201d I said smugly, leaning back in my chair.\nSim took a deep breath and stared hard at the piece of chalk. It trembled. Wil leaned close to Denna and explained. \u201cOne sympathist can oppose\nanother\u2019s Alar,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is just a matter of firmly believing that a drab is not the same as a silver penny at all.\u201d", "Wil pointed, and the penny clattered to the tabletop.\n\u201cFoul,\u201d I protested, laughing. \u201cTwo on one isn\u2019t fair.\u201d\n\u201cIt is in this case,\u201d Simmon said, and the chalk trembled again.\n\u201cFine,\u201d I said, taking a deep breath. \u201cDo your worst.\u201d\nThe chalk dropped to the table quickly, followed by the drab. But the silver\ntalent stayed where it was.\nSim sat back in his chair. \u201cYou\u2019re creepy,\u201d he said, shaking his head.\n\u201cFine, you win. \u201dWilem nodded and relaxed as well.\nDenna looked at me. \u201cSo your Alar is stronger than theirs put together?\u201d \u201cProbably not,\u201d I said graciously. \u201cIf they had practice working together\nthey could probably beat me.\u201d\nHer eyes ranged over the scattered coins. \u201cSo that\u2019s it?\u201d she asked,\nsounding slightly disappointed. \u201cIt\u2019s all just energy moneychanging?\u201d \u201cThere are other arts,\u201d I said. \u201cSim does alchemy, for example.\u201d \u201cWhile I,\u201d Wilem said, \u201cfocus on being pretty.\u201d\nDenna looked us over again, her eyes serious. \u201cIs there a type of magic\nthat\u2019s just . . .\u201d She wiggled her fingers vaguely. \u201cJust sort of writing things down?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s sygaldry,\u201d I said. \u201cLike that bell in your room. It\u2019s like permanent sympathy.\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s still moneychanging, right?\u201d she asked. \u201cJust energy?\u201d\nI nodded.\nDenna looked embarrassed as she asked, \u201cWhat if someone told you they\nknew a type of magic that did more than that? A magic where you sort of wrote things down, and whatever you wrote became true?\u201d\nShe looked down nervously, her fingers tracing patterns on the tabletop. \u201cThen, if someone saw the writing, even if they couldn\u2019t read it, it would be true for them. They\u2019d think a certain thing, or act a certain way depending on what the writing said.\u201d She looked up at us again, her expression a strange mix of curiosity, hope, and uncertainty.\nThe three of us looked at each other. Wilem shrugged.\n\u201cSounds a damn sight easier than alchemy,\u201d Simmon said. \u201cI\u2019d rather do that than spend all day unbinding principles.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like faerie-tale magic,\u201d I said. \u201cStorybook stuff that doesn\u2019t really exist. I certainly never heard about anything like that at the University.\u201d\nDenna looked down at the tabletop where her fingers still traced patterns against the wood. Her mouth was pursed slightly, her eyes distant.", "I couldn\u2019t tell if she was disappointed or simply thoughtful. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d\nDenna looked up at me and her expression quickly slid into a wry smile. She shrugged away the question. \u201cIt was just something I heard,\u201d she said dismissively. \u201cI thought it sounded too good to be true.\u201d\nShe looked over her shoulder. \u201cI seem to have outlasted my overenthusiastic suitor,\u201d she said.\nWil held up the flat of his hand. \u201cWe had an arrangement,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was drink involved, and a woman\u2019s secret.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll have a word with the barman before I leave,\u201d Denna said, her eyes dancing with amusement. \u201cAs for the secret: There are two ladies sitting behind you. They\u2019ve been making eyes at you for most of the evening. The one in green fancies Sim, while the one with short blond hair seems to have a thing for Cealdish men who focus on being pretty.\u201d\n\u201cWe have already made note of them,\u201d Wilem said without turning to look. \u201cUnfortunately, they are already in the company of a young Modegan gentleman.\u201d\n\u201cThe gentleman is not with them in any romantic sense,\u201d Denna said. \u201cWhile the ladies have been eyeing you, the gentleman has been making it abundantly clear that he prefers redheads.\u201d She lay her hand on my arm possessively. \u201cUnfortunately for him, I have already staked my claim.\u201d\nI fought the urge to look at the table. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she said to Wil and Sim. \u201cI\u2019ll send Deoch over to distract the Modegan. That will leave the door open for the two of you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Deoch going to do?\u201d Simmon said with a laugh. \u201cJuggle?\u201d Denna gave him a frank look.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Simmon said. \u201cWh . . . Deoch isn\u2019t sly.\u201d\nDenna blinked at him. \u201cHe and Stanchion own the Eolian together,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cDidn\u2019t you know that?\u201d\n\u201cThey own the place,\u201d Sim said. \u201cThey\u2019re not, you know, together.\u201d Denna laughed. \u201cOf course they are.\u201d\n\u201cBut Deoch is up to his neck in women,\u201d Simmon protested. \u201cHe . . . he\ncan\u2019t\u2014\u201d\nDenna looked at him as if he were simple, then to Wil and myself. \u201cThe\ntwo of you knew, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\nWilem shrugged. \u201cI hadn\u2019t any knowledge of it. But small wonder he is a\nBasha. He is attractive enough.\u201d Wil hesitated, frowned. \u201cBasha. What is a", "word for that here? A man who is intimate with both women and men?\u201d \u201cLucky?\u201d Denna suggested. \u201cTired? Ambidextrous?\u201d\n\u201cAmbisextrous,\u201d I corrected.\n\u201cThat won\u2019t do,\u201d Denna chided me. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have impressive sounding\nnames for things, no one will take us seriously.\u201d\nSim blinked at her, obviously unable to come to grips with the situation. \u201cYou see,\u201d Denna said slowly, as if explaining to a child. \u201cIt\u2019s all just\nenergy. And we can direct it in different ways.\u201d She blossomed into a brilliant smile, as if realizing the perfect way to explain the situation to him. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you do this.\u201d She began to vigorously rub her hands up and down her thighs, mimicking his earlier motion. \u201cIt\u2019s all just energy.\u201d\nBy this point Wilem was hiding his face in his hands, his shoulders shaking with silent laughter. Simmon\u2019s expression was still incredulous and confused, but now it was also a furious, blushing red.\nI got to my feet and took Denna\u2019s elbow. \u201cLeave the poor boy alone,\u201d I said as I steered her gently toward the door. \u201cHe\u2019s from Atur. They\u2019re laced a little tightly in those parts.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER NINETEEN": ["CHAPTER NINETEEN\nGentlemen and Thieves\nIT WAS LATE WHEN Denna and I left the Eolian, and the streets were empty. In the distance I heard fiddle music and the hollow clopping of a horse\u2019s hooves on cobblestones.\n\u201cSo what rock have you been hiding under?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cThe usual rock,\u201d I said, then a thought occurred to me. \u201cDid you come looking for me at the University? At the big square building that smells like coal smoke?\u201d\nDenna shook her head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t begin to know where to find you there. It\u2019s like a maze. If I can\u2019t catch you playing at Anker\u2019s, I know I\u2019m out of luck.\u201d She looked at me curiously. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cSomeone showed up asking for me,\u201d I said with a dismissive gesture. \u201cShe said I\u2019d sold her a charm. I thought it might be you.\u201d\n\u201cI did come looking for you a while back,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I never mentioned your abundant charm.\u201d\nThe conversation lulled and silence swelled between us. I couldn\u2019t help but think of her walking arm in arm with Ambrose. I didn\u2019t want to know any more about it, but at the same time, it was the only thing in my head.\n\u201cI came to visit you at the Grey Man,\u201d I said, just to fill the air between us. \u201cBut you\u2019d already gone.\u201d\nShe nodded. \u201cKellin and I had a bit of a falling out.\u201d\n\u201cNothing too bad, I hope.\u201d I gestured to her throat. \u201cI notice you still have the necklace.\u201d\nDenna touched the teardrop emerald absentmindedly. \u201cNo. Nothing terrible. You can say this for Kellin, he\u2019s a traditionalist. When he gives a gift, he sticks to it. He said the color flattered me, and I should keep the earrings too.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI\u2019d feel better if he hadn\u2019t been so gracious. Still, they\u2019re nice to have. A safety net of sorts. They\u2019ll make my life easier if I don\u2019t hear from my patron soon.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re still hoping to hear from him?\u201d I asked. \u201cAfter what happened in", "Trebon? After he\u2019s been out of contact for more than a month with no word at all?\u201d\nDenna shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s just his way. I told you, he\u2019s a secretive sort. It\u2019s not odd for him to be gone for long stretches of time.\u201d\n\u201cI have a friend who is trying to find me a patron,\u201d I said. \u201cI could have him look for you too.\u201d\nShe looked up at me, her eyes unreadable. \u201cIt\u2019s sweet that you think I deserve better, but I really don\u2019t. I have a good voice, but that\u2019s it. Who would hire a half-trained musician without even an instrument to her name?\u201d\n\u201cAnyone with ears to hear you,\u201d I said. \u201cAnyone with eyes to see.\u201d\nDenna looked down, her hair falling around her face like a curtain. \u201cYou\u2019re sweet,\u201d she said quietly, making an odd fidgeting gesture with her hands.\n\u201cWhat ended up souring things with Kellin?\u201d I asked, steering the conversation somewhere safer.\n\u201cI spent too much time entertaining gentlemen callers,\u201d she said dryly.\n\u201cYou should have explained to him that I\u2019m nothing remotely resembling a gentleman,\u201d I said. \u201cThat might have eased his mind.\u201d But I knew I couldn\u2019t have been the problem. I\u2019d only managed to visit once. Had it been Ambrose that had come calling? I could picture him in the lavish sitting room all too easily. That damn hat of his hanging casually off the corner of a chair as he drank chocolate and told jokes.\nDenna\u2019s mouth quirked. \u201cIt was mostly Geoffrey he objected to,\u201d she said. \u201cApparently I was supposed to sit quiet and alone in my little box until he came to call on me.\u201d\n\u201cHow is Geoffrey?\u201d I asked to be polite. \u201cHas he managed to get a second thought into his head yet?\u201d\nI expected to get a laugh, but Denna merely sighed. \u201cHe has, but none of them are particularly good thoughts.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cHe came to Imre to make a name for himself with his poetry, but lost his shirt gambling.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard that story before,\u201d I said. \u201cHappens all the time over at the University.\u201d\n\u201cThat was just the beginning,\u201d she said. \u201cHe figured he could win his money back, of course. First came the pawnshop. Then he borrowed money and lost that too.\u201d She made a conciliatory gesture. \u201cThough in all fairness, he didn\u2019t gamble that away. Some bitch rooked him. Caught him with the weeping widow of all things.\u201d", "I looked at her, puzzled. \u201cThe what?\u201d\nDenna looked at me sideways, then shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple rook,\u201d she said. \u201cA young woman stands outside a pawnshop all flustered and teary, then when some rich gent walks by she explains how she came to the city to sell her wedding ring. She needs money for taxes, or to repay a moneylender.\u201d\nShe waved her hands impatiently. \u201cThe details don\u2019t matter. What matters is when she got to town, she asked someone else to pawn the ring for her. Because she doesn\u2019t know a thing about bargaining, of course.\u201d\nDenna stopped walking in front of a pawnshop window, her face a mask of distress. \u201cI thought I could trust him!\u201d she said. \u201cBut he just pawned it and ran off with the money! There\u2019s the ring right there!\u201d She pointed dramatically at the shop\u2019s window.\n\u201cBut,\u201d Denna continued, holding up a finger. \u201cLuckily, he sold the ring for a fraction of what it\u2019s worth. It\u2019s a family heirloom worth forty talents, but the pawnshop is selling it for four.\u201d\nDenna stepped close and lay her hand on my chest, looking up at me with wide, imploring eyes. \u201cIf you bought the ring, we could sell it for at least twenty. I\u2019d give you your four talents back right away.\u201d\nShe stepped back and shrugged. \u201cThat sort of thing.\u201d\nI frowned. \u201cHow is that a rook? I\u2019ll catch on as soon as we go to the assessor.\u201d\nDenna rolled her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s not how it works. We agree to meet tomorrow at noon. But by the time I get there, you\u2019ve already bought the ring yourself and run off with it.\u201d\nI suddenly understood. \u201cAnd you split the money with the owner of the pawnshop?\u201d\nShe patted my shoulder. \u201cI knew you\u2019d catch on sooner or later.\u201d\nIt seemed fairly watertight except for one thing. \u201cSeems you\u2019d need a special combination of trustworthy-yet-crooked pawnshop as a partner.\u201d\n\u201cTrue,\u201d she admitted. \u201cThey\u2019re usually marked though.\u201d Denna pointed to the top of the nearby pawnshop\u2019s doorframe. There were a series of marks that could easily be mistaken for random scratches in the paint.\n\u201cAh,\u201d I hesitated for half a moment before adding, \u201cIn Tarbean, markings like that meant this was a safe place to fence . . .\u201d I groped for an appropriate euphemism. \u201cQuestionably acquired goods.\u201d\nIf Denna was startled by my confession she gave no sign of it. She merely", "shook her head and pointed more closely to the markings, moving her finger as she went. \u201cThis says, \u2018Reliable owner. Open to simple rooks. Even split.\u2019 \u201d She glanced around at the rest of the doorframe and the shop\u2019s sign. \u201cNothing about fencing goods from uncle.\u201d\n\u201cI never knew how to read them,\u201d I admitted. I glanced sideways at her, careful to keep any judgment out of my tone. \u201cAnd you know how this sort of thing works because . . .?\u201d\n\u201cI read it in a book,\u201d she said sarcastically. \u201cHow do you think I know about it?\u201d\nShe continued walking down the street. I joined her.\n\u201cI don\u2019t usually play it as a widow,\u201d Denna said, almost as an afterthought. \u201cI\u2019m too young for that. For me it\u2019s my mother\u2019s ring. Or grandmother\u2019s.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cYou change it to whatever feels right at the time.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if the gent is honest?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhat if he shows up at noon, willing to help?\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen often,\u201d she with a wry twist to her mouth. \u201cOnly once for me. Caught me completely by surprise. Now I set things up in advance with the owner just in case. I\u2019m happy to rook some greedy bastard who tries to take advantage of a young girl. But I\u2019m not about to take money off someone who\u2019s trying to help.\u201d Her expression went hard. \u201cUnlike the bitch who got hold of Geoffrey.\u201d\n\u201cShowed up at noon, did he?\u201d\n\u201cOf course he did,\u201d she said. \u201cJust gave her the money. \u2018No need to pay me back, miss. You go save the family farm.\u2019 \u201d Denna ran her hands through her hair, looking up at the sky. \u201cA farm! That doesn\u2019t even make any sense! Why would a farmer\u2019s wife have a diamond necklace?\u201d She glanced over at me. \u201cWhy are the sweet ones such idiots with women?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s noble,\u201d I said. \u201cCan\u2019t he just write home?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s never been on good terms with his family,\u201d she said. \u201cLess so now. His last letter didn\u2019t have any money, just the news that his mother was sick.\u201d\nSomething in her voice caught my ear. \u201cHow sick?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cSick.\u201d Denna didn\u2019t look up. \u201cVery sick. And of course he\u2019s already sold his horse and can\u2019t afford passage on a ship.\u201d She sighed again. \u201cIt\u2019s like watching one of those awful Tehlin dramas unfold. The Path Ill-Chosen or something of the sort.\u201d\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, all he has to do is stumble into a church at the end of the fourth act,\u201d I said. \u201cHe\u2019ll pray, learn his lesson, and live the rest of his days a", "clean and virtuous boy.\u201d\n\u201cIt would be different if he came to me for advice.\u201d She made a frustrated\ngesture. \u201cBut no, he stops by afterward to tell me what he\u2019s done. The guild moneylender cut off his credit, so what does he do?\u201d\nMy stomach twisted. \u201cHe goes to a gaelet,\u201d I said.\n\u201cAnd he was happy when he told me!\u201d Denna looked at me, her expression despairing. \u201cLike he\u2019d finally figured a way out of this mess.\u201d She shivered. \u201cLet\u2019s go in here.\u201d She pointed to a small garden. \u201cThere\u2019s more wind tonight than I thought.\u201d\nI set down my lute case and shrugged out of my cloak. \u201cHere, I\u2019m fine.\u201d\nDenna looked like she was going to object for a moment, then drew it around herself. \u201cAnd you say you\u2019re not a gentleman,\u201d she chided.\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I said. \u201cI just know it will smell better after you\u2019ve worn it.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d she said wisely. \u201cAnd then you will sell it to a perfumery and make your fortune.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s been my plan all along,\u201d I admitted. \u201cA cunning and elaborate scheme. I\u2019m more thief than a gentleman, you see.\u201d\nWe sat down on a bench out of the wind. \u201cI think you\u2019ve lost a buckle,\u201d she said.\nI looked down at my lute case. The narrow end was gaping open, and the iron buckle was nowhere to be seen.\nI sighed and absentmindedly reached for one of the inner pockets of my cloak.\nDenna made a tiny noise. Nothing loud, just a startled indrawn breath as she looked suddenly up at me, her eyes wide and dark in the moonlight.\nI pulled my hand back as if burned by a fire, stammering an apology.\nDenna began to laugh quietly. \u201cWell that\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d she said softly to herself.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking. I\u2019ve got some wire in there that I can use to hold this closed for now.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course.\u201d Her hands moved inside the cloak for a moment, then she held out a piece of wire.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said again.\n\u201cI was just startled,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you were the sort to grab hold of a lady without some warning first.\u201d\nI looked down at the lute, embarrassed, and made my hands busy, running the wire through a hole the buckle had left and twisting it tightly shut.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely lute,\u201d Denna said after a long, quiet moment. \u201cBut that case is an absolute shambles.\u201d\n\u201cI tapped myself out buying the lute itself,\u201d I said, then looked up as if suddenly struck with an idea. \u201cI know! I\u2019ll ask Geoffrey to give me the name of his gaelet! Then I can afford two cases!\u201d\nShe swatted at me playfully, and I moved to sit next to her on the bench.\nThings were quiet for a moment, then Denna looked down at her hands and repeated a fidgeting gesture she\u2019d made several times during our talk. Only now did I realize what she was doing. \u201cYour ring,\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat happened to it?\u201d\nDenna gave me an odd look.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had a ring for as long as I\u2019ve known you.\u201d I explained. \u201cSilver with a pale blue stone.\u201d\nHer forehead furrowed. \u201cI know what it looked like. How did you?\u201d\n\u201cYou wear it all the time,\u201d I said, trying to sound casual, as if I didn\u2019t know every detail of her. As if I didn\u2019t know her habit of twirling it on her finger while she was anxious or lost in thought. \u201cWhat happened to it?\u201d\nDenna looked down at her hands. \u201cA young gentleman has it,\u201d she said. \u201cAh,\u201d I said. Then, because I couldn\u2019t help myself, I added. \u201cWho?\u201d\n\u201cI doubt you\u2014\u201d She paused, then looked up at me. \u201cActually, you might\nknow him. He goes to the University too. Ambrose Jakis.\u201d\nMy stomach was suddenly filled with acid and ice.\nDenna looked away. \u201cHe has a rough charm about him,\u201d she explained.\n\u201cMore rough than charm, really. But . . .\u201d She trailed off into a shrug.\n\u201cI see,\u201d I said. Then, \u201cIt must be fairly serious.\u201d\nDenna gave me a quizzical look, then realization spread onto her face and\nshe burst out laughing. She shook her head, waving her hands in violent negation. \u201cOh no. God no. Nothing like that. He came calling a few times. We went to a play. He invited me out for dancing. He\u2019s remarkably light on his feet.\u201d\nShe drew a deep breath and let it out in a sigh. \u201cThe first night he was very genteel. Witty even. The second night, slightly less so.\u201d Her eyes narrowed. \u201cOn the third night he got pushy. Things went sour after that. I had to leave my rooms at the Boar\u2019s Head because he kept showing up with trinkets and poems.\u201d\nA feeling of vast relief flooded me. For the first time in days I felt like I was able to take a full lungful of air. I felt a smile threatening to burst out", "onto my face and fought it down, fearing it would be so wide I\u2019d look like an absolute madman.\nDenna gave me a wry look. \u201cYou\u2019d be amazed at how similar arrogance and confidence look at first glance. And he was generous, and rich, which is a nice combination.\u201d She held up her naked hand. \u201cThe fitting was loose on my ring, and he said he\u2019d have it repaired.\u201d\n\u201cI take it he wasn\u2019t nearly so generous after things went sour?\u201d\nHer red mouth made another wry smile. \u201cNot nearly.\u201d\n\u201cI might be able to do something,\u201d I said. \u201cIf the ring\u2019s important to you.\u201d \u201cIt was important,\u201d Denna said, giving me a frank look. \u201cBut what would\nyou do, exactly? Remind him, one gentleman to another, that he should treat women with dignity and respect?\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cGood luck.\u201d\nI simply gave her my most charming smile. I\u2019d already told her the truth of things: I was no gentleman. I was a thief.", ""], "CHAPTER TWENTY": ["CHAPTER TWENTY\nThe Fickle Wind\nTHE NEXT EVENING FOUND me at the Golden Pony, arguably the finest inn on the University side of the river. It boasted elaborate kitchens, a fine stable, and a skilled obsequious staff. It was the sort of upscale establishment only the wealthiest students could afford.\nI wasn\u2019t inside, of course. I was crouched in the deep shadows of the roof, trying not to dwell on the fact that what I was planning went well beyond the bounds of Conduct Unbecoming. If I was caught breaking into Ambrose\u2019s rooms, I would undoubtedly be expelled.\nIt was a clear autumn night with a strong wind. A mixed blessing. The sound of rustling leaves would cover any small noises I might make, but I worried the flapping edges of my cloak might draw attention.\nOur plan was a simple one. I had slipped a sealed note under Ambrose\u2019s door. It was an unsigned, flirtatious request for a meeting in Imre. Wil had written it, as Sim and I judged he had the most feminine handwriting.\nIt was a goose chase, but I guessed Ambrose would take the bait. I would have preferred to have someone distract him personally, but the fewer people involved the better. I could have asked Denna to help, but I wanted it to be a surprise when I returned her ring.\nWil and Sim were my lookouts, Wil in the common room, Sim in the alley by the back door. It was their job to let me know when Ambrose left the building. More importantly, they would alert me if he came back before I\u2019d finished searching his rooms.\nI felt a sharp tug in my right-hand pocket as the oak twig gave two distinct twitches. After a moment the signal was repeated. Wilem was letting me know Ambrose had left the inn.\nIn my left pocket was a piece of birch. Simmon held a similar one where he stood watch over the inn\u2019s back door. It was a simple, effective signaling system if you knew enough sympathy to make it work.\nI crawled down the slope of the roof, moving carefully over the heavy clay", "tiles. I knew from my younger days in Tarbean that they tended to crack and slide and could make you lose your footing.\nI made it to the lip of the roof, fifteen feet off the ground. Hardly a dizzying height, but more than enough to break a leg or a neck. A narrow piece of roof ran beneath the long row of second-story windows. There were ten in all, and the middle four belonged to Ambrose.\nI flexed my fingers a couple times to loosen them, then began to edge along the narrow strip of roof.\nThe secret is to concentrate on what you\u2019re doing. Don\u2019t look at the ground. Don\u2019t look over your shoulder. Ignore the world and trust it to return the favor. This was the real reason I was wearing my cloak. If I were spotted I would be nothing more than a dark shape in the night, impossible to identify. Hopefully.\nThe first window was dark, and the second had its curtains drawn. But the third was dimly lit. I hesitated. If you\u2019re fair-skinned like me, you never want to peer into a window at night. Your face will stand out against the dark like the full moon. Rather than risk peering in, I dug around in the pockets of my cloak until I found a piece of scrap tin from the Fishery that I\u2019d buffed into a makeshift mirror. Then I carefully used it to peer around the corner and through the window.\nInside there were a few dim lamps and a canopy bed as big as my entire room back in Anker\u2019s. The bed was occupied. Actively occupied. What\u2019s more, there seemed to be more naked limbs than two people could account for. Unfortunately, my piece of tin was small, and I couldn\u2019t view the scene in its full complexity, otherwise I might have learned some very interesting things.\nI briefly considered going back and coming at Ambrose\u2019s rooms from the other side, but the wind gusted suddenly, sending leaves skipping across the cobblestones and trying to claw me away from my narrow footing. Heart pounding, I decided to risk passing this window. I guessed the people inside had better things to do than stargazing.\nI pulled the hood of my cloak down and held the edges in my teeth, covering my face while leaving my hands free. Thus blinded, I inched my way past the window, listening intently for any signs I\u2019d been spotted. There were a few surprised noises, but they didn\u2019t seem to have anything to do with me.\nThe first of Ambrose\u2019s windows was elaborate stained glass. Pretty, but", "not designed to open. The next was perfect: a wide, double window. I pulled a thin piece of copper wire from one of the pockets of my cloak and used it to trip the simple latch holding it closed.\nWhen the window wouldn\u2019t open, I realized that Ambrose had added a drop bar as well. That took several long minutes of tricky work, one-handed in the near-total dark. Thankfully, the wind had died down, at least for the moment.\nThen, once I\u2019d worked my way past the drop bar, the window still wouldn\u2019t budge. I began to curse Ambrose\u2019s paranoia as I searched for the third lock, hunting for nearly ten minutes before I realized the window was simply stuck shut.\nI tugged on it a couple times, which isn\u2019t as easy as it sounds. They don\u2019t put handles on the outside, you realize. Eventually I got overenthusiastic and pulled too hard. The window sprang open and my weight shifted backward. I leaned off the edge of the roof, fighting every reflex that urged me to move my foot back and regain my balance, knowing there was nothing but fifteen feet of empty air behind me.\nDo you know the feeling when you tip your chair too far and begin to fall backward? The sensation was something like that, mixed with self- recrimination and the fear of death. I flailed my arms, knowing it wouldn\u2019t help, my mind gone suddenly blank with panic.\nThe wind saved me. It gusted as I teetered on the edge of the roof, giving me just enough of a push that I could regain my balance. One of my flailing arms caught the now-open window and I scrambled desperately inside, not caring how much noise I made.\nOnce through the window I crouched on the floor, breathing hard. My heart was just beginning to slow when the wind caught the window and slammed it closed above my head, startling me all over again.\nI brought out my sympathy lamp, thumbed the switch to a dim setting, and swept the narrow arc of light around the room. Kilvin had been right to call it a thief \u2019s lamp. It was perfect for this sort of skulking about.\nIt was miles to Imre and back, and I trusted Ambrose\u2019s curiosity would keep him waiting for his secret admirer for at least half an hour. Normally looking for something as small as a ring would be a full day\u2019s job. But I guessed Ambrose wouldn\u2019t even think of hiding it. In his mind, it wasn\u2019t something he\u2019d stolen. He would consider it either a trinket or a trophy.\nI set about methodically searching Ambrose\u2019s rooms. The ring wasn\u2019t on", "his chest of drawers or the bedside table. It wasn\u2019t in any of his desk drawers, or on his jewelry tray in his dressing room. He didn\u2019t even have a locked jewelry box, mind you, just a tray with all manner of pins, rings, and chains scattered carelessly across it.\nI left everything where it was, which isn\u2019t to say I didn\u2019t think about robbing the bastard blind. Just a few pieces of his jewelry could pay my tuition for a year. But it went against my plan: get in, find the ring, and get out. So long as I left no evidence of my visit, I guessed Ambrose would simply assume he\u2019d lost the ring if he noticed it was gone at all. It was the perfect sort of crime: no suspicion, no pursuit, no consequences.\nBesides, it\u2019s notoriously difficult to fence jewelry in a town as small as Imre. It would be far too easy for someone to trace it back to me.\nThat said, I\u2019ve never claimed to be a priest, and there were plenty of opportunities for mischief in Ambrose\u2019s rooms. So I indulged myself. While checking Ambrose\u2019s pockets, I weakened a few seams so there was a fair chance of him splitting his pants up the back the next time he sat down or mounted his horse. I loosened the handle on his chimney\u2019s flue so it would eventually fall off, and his room would fill with smoke while he scrambled to reattach it.\nI was trying to think of something to do to his damned irritating plumed hat when the oak twig in my pocket twitched violently, making me jump. Then it twitched again and broke sharply in half. I cursed bitterly under my breath. Ambrose couldn\u2019t have been gone for more than twenty minutes. What had brought him back so soon?\nI clicked off my sympathy lamp and stuffed it into my cloak. Then I scurried into the next room to make my escape through the window. It was irritating to go through all the trouble of getting in just to leave again, but as long as Ambrose didn\u2019t know anyone had broken into his rooms, I could simply come back another night.\nBut the window didn\u2019t open. I pushed harder, wondering if it had jammed itself shut when the wind had slammed it.\nThen I glimpsed a thin strip of brass running along the inside of the windowsill. I couldn\u2019t read the sygaldry in the dim light, but I know wards when I see them. That explained why Ambrose was back so soon. He knew someone had broken in. What\u2019s more, the best sort of wards wouldn\u2019t just warn of an intruder, they could hold a door or window shut to seal a thief in.\nI bolted for the door, hands scrabbling in the pockets of my cloak, looking", "for something long and slender I could use to foul the lock. Not finding anything suitable, I snatched a pen from his writing desk, jammed it into the keyhole, then jerked it hard sideways, breaking the metal head off inside the lock. A moment later I heard a grating metallic noise as Ambrose attempted to unlock the door from his side, fumbling and cursing when he couldn\u2019t get his key to fit.\nBy that point I was already back at the window, shining my lamp back and forth along the strip of brass and murmuring runes under my breath. It was simple enough. I could render it useless by scratching out a handful of connecting runes, then open the window and escape.\nI hurried back to the sitting room and snatched the letter opener off his desk, knocking over the capped inkwell in my hurry. I was just about to begin eliding runes when I realized how stupid that would be. Any petty thief could break into Ambrose\u2019s rooms, but the number of people who knew enough sygaldry to foul a ward was much lower. I might as well sign my name on his window frame.\nI took a moment to collect my thoughts, then returned the letter opener to the desk and replaced the inkwell. I returned and examined the long brass strip more closely. Breaking something is simple, understanding it is harder.\nThis is doubly true when you are confronted with the sounds of muttered cursing from behind a door, accompanied by the clack and rattle of someone trying to unjam a lock.\nThen the hallway went quiet, which was even more unnerving. I finally managed to puzzle out the sequence of wards as I heard several sets of footsteps in the hall. I broke my mind into three pieces and focused my Alar as I pushed against the window. My hands and feet grew cold as I pulled heat from my body to counteract the ward, trying not to panic as I heard a loud thump as something heavy struck the door.\nThe window swung open, and I scrambled backward over the sash and onto the roof as something struck the door again and I heard the sharp crack of splintering wood. I still could have made it away safely, but when I set my right foot down on the roof, I felt a clay tile crack under my weight. As my foot slid, I grabbed the windowsill with both hands to steady myself.\nThen the wind gusted, catching the open window and flinging it toward my head. I brought up my arm to protect my face, and it struck my elbow instead, smashing one of the small panes of glass. The impact pushed me sideways onto my right foot, which slid the rest of the way out from underneath me.", "Then, since all my other options seemed to be exhausted, I decided it would be best if I fell off the roof.\nActing on pure instinct, my hands scrabbled madly. I dislodged a few more clay tiles, then caught hold of the lip of the roof. My grip wasn\u2019t good, but it slowed and spun me so that I didn\u2019t land on my head or my back. Instead I landed facedown, like a cat.\nExcept a cat\u2019s legs are all the same length. I landed on my hands and knees. My hands merely stung, but my knees striking the cobblestones hurt as badly as anything I\u2019d ever felt in my entire young life. The pain was blinding, and I heard myself yelp like a dog that\u2019s been kicked.\nA second later a hail of heavy red roofing tiles fell around me. Most shattered on the cobblestones, but one clipped the back of my head, while another caught me square on the elbow, making my entire forearm go numb.\nI didn\u2019t spare it a moment\u2019s thought. A broken arm would heal, but expulsion from the University would last a lifetime. I pulled my hood up and forced myself to my feet. Using one hand to make sure the hood of my cloak stayed in place, I staggered a few steps until I was under the eaves of the Golden Pony, out of sight of the upstairs window.\nThen I was running, running, running. . . .\nEventually I made my careful, limping way onto the rooftops and let myself into my room by the window. It was slow going, but I had little choice. I couldn\u2019t walk past everyone in the taproom disheveled, limping, and generally looking as if I\u2019d just fallen off a roof.\nOnce I caught my breath and spent some time abusing myself for several types of blinding idiocy, I took stock of my wounds. The good news was that I hadn\u2019t broken either of my legs, but I had splendid bruises blooming just below each knee. The tile that had grazed my head had left a lump, but hadn\u2019t cut me. And while my elbow throbbed with a dull ache, my hand was no longer numb.\nThere was a knock at the door. I froze for a moment, then drew the birch twig from my pocket, muttered a quick binding, and jerked it back and forth.\nI heard a startled noise from out in the hall, followed by Wilem\u2019s low laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny,\u201d I heard Sim say. \u201cLet us in.\u201d\n \nI let them in. Simmon sat on the edge of the bed, and Wilem took the chair by the desk. I closed the door and sat on the other half of the bed. Even with all of us seated, the tiny room was crowded.\nWe eyed each other soberly for a moment, then Simmon spoke up. \u201cApparently Ambrose startled a thief in his rooms tonight. Fellow jumped out a window rather than get caught.\u201d\nI gave a brief, humorless laugh. \u201cHardly. I was almost out when the window blew shut on me.\u201d I gestured awkwardly. \u201cKnocked me off the roof.\u201d\nWilem let out a relieved sigh. \u201cI thought I botched the binding.\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cI had plenty of warning. I just wasn\u2019t as careful as I should have been.\u201d\n\u201cWhy was he back so early?\u201d Simmon asked, looking at Wilem. \u201cDid you hear anything when he came in?\u201d\n\u201cIt probably occurred to him that my handwriting is not especially feminine,\u201d Wilem said.\n\u201cHe had wards on his windows,\u201d I said. \u201cProbably linked to a ring or something he carries with him. They must have tipped him off as soon as I opened the window.\u201d\n\u201cDid you get it?\u201dWilem asked.\nI shook my head.\nSimmon craned his neck to get a better look at my arm. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d I followed his eyes, but didn\u2019t see anything. Then I tugged at my shirt and\nnoticed that it was stuck to the back of my arm. With all my other pains, I hadn\u2019t noticed it.\nMoving gingerly, I pulled my shirt up over my head. The elbow of the shirt was torn and speckled with blood. I cursed bitterly. I only owned four shirts, and now this one was ruined.\nI tried to get a look at my the injury, and quickly realized that you couldn\u2019t get a look at the back of your own elbow, no matter how much you wanted to. Eventually I held it up for Simmon\u2019s inspection.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not much,\u201d he said, holding his fingers a little more than two inches apart. \u201cThere\u2019s only one cut and it\u2019s hardly bleeding. The rest of it\u2019s just scraped up. It looks like you scuffed it hard against something.\u201d\n\u201cClay tile from the roof fell on me,\u201d I said.\n\u201cLucky,\u201d Wilem grunted. \u201cWho else could fall off a roof and end up with nothing more than a few scrapes?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve got bruises on my knees the size of apples,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll be lucky if I", "can walk tomorrow.\u201d But deep down I knew he was right. The clay tile that had landed on my elbow could easily have broken my arm. The broken edges of the clay tiles were sometimes sharp as knives, so if it had hit me differently, it could have cut me down to the bone. I hate clay roofing tiles.\n\u201cWell, it could have been worse,\u201d Simmon said briskly as he came to his feet. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the Medica and get you patched up.\u201d\n\u201cKraem no,\u201d Wilem said. \u201cHe can\u2019t go to the Medica. They will be asking to see if anyone is hurt.\u201d\nSimmon sat down again. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said, sounding vaguely disgusted with himself. \u201cI knew that.\u201d He looked me over. \u201cAt least you\u2019re not hurt anywhere that people can see.\u201d\nI looked at Wilem. \u201cYou have a problem with blood, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nHis expression grew slightly offended. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say . . .\u201d His eyes darted to my elbow and his face grew a little pale despite his dark Cealdish complexion. His mouth made a thin line. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cFair enough.\u201d I started to cut my ruined shirt into strips of cloth. \u201cCongratulations Sim. You\u2019ve been promoted to field medic.\u201d I opened a drawer and brought out hook needle and gut, iodine, and a small pot of goose grease.\nSim looked at the needle, then back at me, eyes wide.\nI gave him my best smile. \u201cIt\u2019s easy. I\u2019ll talk you through it.\u201d\nI sat on the floor with my arm over my head while Simmon washed, stitched, and bandaged my elbow. He surprised me by being nowhere near as squeamish as I\u2019d expected. His hands were more careful and confident than those of many students in the Medica who did this sort of thing all the time.\n\u201cSo the three of us were here, playing breath all night?\u201d Wil asked, pointedly avoiding looking in my direction.\n\u201cSounds good,\u201d Sim said. \u201cCan we say I won?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cPeople must have seen Wil at the Pony. Lie and they\u2019ll catch me for sure.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Sim said. \u201cWhat do we say then?\u201d\n\u201cThe truth.\u201d I pointed at Wil. \u201cYou were at the Pony during the excitement, then came here to tell me about it.\u201d I nodded to the small table,\n \nwhere a mass of gears, springs, and screws were spread in disarray. \u201cI showed you the harmony clock I found, and you both gave me advice on how to fix it.\u201d\nSim seemed disappointed. \u201cNot very exciting.\u201d\n\u201cSimple lies are best,\u201d I said, getting to my feet. \u201cThanks again, both of you. This could have gone terribly wrong without the two of you looking out for me.\u201d\nSimmon got to his feet and opened the door. Wil stood as well, but didn\u2019t turn to leave. \u201cI heard a strange rumor the other night,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnything interesting?\u201d I asked.\nHe nodded. \u201cVery. I remember hearing that you were done antagonizing a certain powerful member of the nobility. I was surprised that you had finally decided to let sleeping dogs lie.\u201d\n\u201cCome on, Wil,\u201d Simmon said. \u201cAmbrose isn\u2019t sleeping. He\u2019s a dog with the froth that deserves to be put down.\u201d\n\u201cHe more resembles an angry bear,\u201d Wilem said. \u201cOne you seem determined to prod with a burning stick.\u201d\n\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d Sim said hotly. \u201cIn two years as a scriv has he ever called you anything other than a filthy shim? And what about that time he almost blinded me by mixing my salts? Kvothe will be working the plum bob out of his system for\u2014\u201d\nWil held up his hand and nodded to acknowledge Simmon\u2019s point. \u201cI know this to be true, which is why I let myself be drawn into such foolishness. I merely wish to make a point.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cYou realize you have gone well over the hill concerning this Denna girl, don\u2019t you?\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE": ["CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE\nPiecework\nTHE PAIN IN MY knees kept me from any sort of decent sleep that night. So when the sky outside my window started to show the first pale light of coming dawn I gave up, got dressed, and made my slow, painful way to the outskirts of town, looking for willow bark to chew. Along the way I discovered several new, exciting bruises I hadn\u2019t been aware of the night before.\nThe walk was pure agony, but I was glad I was making it in the early morning dark, when the streets were empty. There was bound to be a lot of talk about last night\u2019s excitement at the Golden Pony. If anyone saw me limping, it would be too easy for them to jump to the right conclusions.\nLuckily, the trip loosened the stiffness in my legs and the willow bark took the edge off the pain. By the time the sun was fully up I felt well enough to appear in public. So I headed to the Fishery hoping to get in a few hours of piecework before Adept Sympathy. I needed to start earning money for next term\u2019s tuition and Devi\u2019s loan, not to mention bandages and a new shirt.\nJaxim wasn\u2019t in the Stocks when I arrived, but I recognized the student there. We had entered the University at the same time and bunked close to each other for a little while in the Mews. I liked him. He wasn\u2019t one of the nobility who drifted blithely through the school, carried by his family\u2019s name and money. His parents were wool merchants, and he worked to pay his tuition.\n\u201cBasil,\u201d I said. \u201cI thought you made E\u2019lir last term. What are you doing in the Stocks?\u201d\nHe flushed a little, looking embarrassed. \u201cKilvin caught me adding water to acid.\u201d\nI shook my head, giving a stern scowl. \u201cThis is contrary to proper\n \nprocedure, E\u2019lir Basil,\u201d I said dropping my voice an octave. \u201cAn artificer must move with perfect care in all things.\u201d\nBasil grinned. \u201cYou\u2019ve got his accent.\u201d He opened the ledger book. \u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not feeling up for anything more complicated than piecework right now,\u201d I said. \u201cHow about\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHold on,\u201d Basil interrupted, frowning down at the ledger book.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nHe spun the ledger around to face me and pointed. \u201cThere\u2019s a note next to\nyour name.\u201d\nI looked. Penciled in Kilvin\u2019s strangely childlike scrawl was: \u201cNo\nmaterials or tools to Re\u2019lar Kvothe. Send him to me. Klvn.\u201d\nBasil gave me a sympathetic look. \u201cIt\u2019s acid to water,\u201d he joked gently.\n\u201cDid you forget, too?\u201d\n\u201cI wish I had,\u201d I said. \u201cThen I\u2019d know what was going on.\u201d\nBasil looked around nervously, then leaned forward and spoke in a low\nvoice. \u201cListen, I saw that girl again.\u201d\nI blinked at him stupidly. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThe girl that came in here looking for you,\u201d he prompted. \u201cThe young one\nthat was looking for the redheaded wizard who sold her a charm?\u201d\nI closed my eyes and rubbed at my face. \u201cShe came back? This is the last\nthing I need right now.\u201d\nBasil shook his head. \u201cShe didn\u2019t come in,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least not that I\nknow of. But I\u2019ve seen her a couple times outside. She hangs around the courtyard.\u201d He jerked his head toward the southern exit of the Fishery.\n\u201cDid you tell anyone?\u201d I asked.\nBasil looked profoundly offended. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that to you,\u201d he said. \u201cBut she might have talked to someone else. You should really get rid of her. Kilvin will spit nails if he thinks you\u2019ve been selling charms.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve got no idea who she is. What does she look like?\u201d\n\u201cYoung,\u201d Basil said with a shrug. \u201cNot Cealdish. I think she had light hair. She wears a blue cloak with the hood up. I tried to walk over and talk to her, but she just ran away.\u201d\nI rubbed my forehead. \u201cWonderful.\u201d\nBasil shrugged sympathetically. \u201cJust thought I\u2019d warn you. If she actually comes in here and asks for you, I\u2019ll have to tell Kilvin.\u201d He grimaced", "apologetically. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m in enough trouble as it is.\u201d \u201cI understand,\u201d I said. \u201cThanks for the warning.\u201d\nWhen I walked into the workshop, I was immediately struck by a strange quality of the light in the room. The first thing I did was look up, checking to see if Kilvin had added a new lamp to the array of glass spheres hanging up among the rafters. I hoped the change in light was due to a new lamp. Kilvin\u2019s mood was always foul when one of his lamps went unexpectedly dark.\nScanning the rafters, I didn\u2019t see any dark lamps. It took me a long moment to realize the strange quality of the light was due to actual sunlight slanting in through the low windows on the eastern wall. Normally I didn\u2019t come to work until later in the day.\nThe workshop was almost eerily quiet this early in the morning. The huge room seemed hollow and lifeless with only a handful of students working on projects. That combined with the odd light and the unexpected summons from Kilvin, made me rather uneasy as I crossed the room heading toward Kilvin\u2019s office.\nDespite the early hour, a small forge in the corner of Kilvin\u2019s office was already well-stoked. Heat billowed past me as I stood in the open doorway. It felt good after the early winter chill outside. Kilvin stood with his back to me, working the bellows with a relentless rhythm.\nI knocked loudly on the frame of the door to get his attention. \u201cMaster Kilvin? I just tried to check some materials out of Stocks. Is anything the matter?\u201d\nKilvin glanced over in my direction. \u201cRe\u2019lar Kvothe. I will be a moment. Come in.\u201d\nI stepped into his office and swung the heavy door closed behind me. If I was in trouble, I\u2019d rather not have anyone listening in.\nKilvin continued to work the bellows for a long moment. It was only when he drew out a long tube that I realized it wasn\u2019t a forge he was firing, it was a small glasswork. Moving deftly, he drew out a blob of molten glass on the end of his tube, then proceeded to blow an increasingly large bubble of glass.\nAfter a minute the glass lost its orange glow. \u201cBellows,\u201d Kilvin said\n \nwithout looking at me, putting the tube back into the mouth of the glasswork. I scrambled to obey, working the bellows in a steady rhythm until the glass\nwas glowing orange again. Kilvin motioned me to stop, pulled it out, and puffed at the tube for another long moment, spinning the glass until the bubble was large as a sweetmelon.\nHe set it back in the glasswork again, and I pumped the bellows without being asked. By the third time we repeated this, I was wringing with sweat. I wished I hadn\u2019t closed Kilvin\u2019s door, but I didn\u2019t want to leave the bellows for the time it would take for me to open it again.\nKilvin didn\u2019t seem to notice the heat. The glass bubble grew large as my head, then big as a pumpkin. But the fifth time he drew it from the heat and began to blow, it sagged on the end of the tube, deflating and falling to the floor.\n\u201cKist, crayle, en kote,\u201d he swore furiously. He threw down the metal tube where it rang sharply against the stone floor. \u201cKraemet brevetan Aerin!\u201d\nI fought down the sudden urge to laugh. My Siaru wasn\u2019t perfect, but I was fairly certain Kilvin had said, Shit in God\u2019s beard.\nThe bearlike master stood for a long moment, looking down at the ruined glass on the floor. Then he let out a long, irritated breath through his nose, pulled off his goggles, and turned to look at me.\n\u201cThree sets of synchronized bells, brass,\u201d he said without preamble. \u201cOne tap and catch, iron. Four heat funnels, iron. Six siphons, tin.Twenty-two panes of twice-tough glass and other assorted piecework.\u201d\nIt was a list of all the work I had done this term in the Fishery. Simple things I could finish and sell back to Stocks for a quick profit.\nKilvin looked at me with his dark eyes. \u201cDoes this work please you, Re\u2019lar Kvothe?\u201d\n\u201cThe projects are easy enough, Master Kilvin,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou are now a Re\u2019lar,\u201d he said, his voice heavy with reproach. \u201cAre you content to coast idly, making toys for the lazy rich?\u201d he asked. \u201cIs that what you desire from your time in the Fishery? Easy work?\u201d\nI could feel the sweat beading up in my hair and running down my back. \u201cI am somewhat leery of venturing off on my own,\u201d I said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t particularly approve of the modifications I made to my hand lamp.\u201d\n\u201cThose are coward\u2019s words,\u201d Kilvin said. \u201cWill you never leave the house because you were scolded once?\u201d He looked at me. \u201cI ask you again. Bells. Castings. Does this work please you, Re\u2019lar Kvothe?\u201d", "\u201cThe thought of paying next term\u2019s tuition pleases me, Master Kilvin.\u201d Sweat was running down my face. I tried to wipe it away with my sleeve, but my shirt was already soaked through. I glanced at Kilvin\u2019s office door.\n\u201cAnd the work itself?\u201d Kilvin prompted. There was sweat beading on the dark skin of his forehead, but he didn\u2019t seem otherwise bothered by the heat.\n\u201cTruthfully, Master Kilvin?\u201d I asked, feeling a little light-headed.\nHe looked a bit offended. \u201cI value truth in all things, Re\u2019lar Kvothe.\u201d \u201cThe truth is I\u2019ve made eight deck lamps this last year, Master Kilvin. If I\nhave to make another, I expect I might shit myself from pure boredom.\u201d Kilvin huffed something that could have been a laugh, then smiled widely at me. \u201cGood. That is how a Re\u2019lar should feel.\u201d He pointed one thick finger\nat me. \u201cYou are clever, and you have good hands. I expect great things from you. Not drudgery. Make something clever and it will earn you more than a lamp. Certainly more than piecework. Leave that to the E\u2019lir.\u201d He gestured dismissively at the window that looked out over the workshop.\n\u201cI\u2019ll do my best, Master Kilvin,\u201d I said. My voice sounded strange to my own ears, distant and tinny. \u201cDo you mind if I open the door and get some fresh air in here?\u201d\nKilvin grunted an agreement, and I took a step toward the door. But my legs felt loose and my head spun. I staggered and almost fell headlong onto the floor, but I managed to catch the edge of the worktable and merely went to my knees instead.\nWhen my bruised knees hit the stone floor it was excruciating. But I didn\u2019t shout or cry out. In fact, the pain seemed to be coming from a long way off.\nI awoke confused, with a mouth as dry as sawdust. My eyes were gummy and my thoughts so sluggish it took me a long moment to recognize the distinctive antiseptic tang in the air. That, combined with the fact that I was lying naked under a sheet, let me know I was in the Medica.\nI turned my head and saw short blond hair and the dark physicker\u2019s uniform. I relaxed back onto the pillow. \u201cHello Mola,\u201d I croaked.\nShe turned and gave me a serious look. \u201cKvothe,\u201d she said formally. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d\nStill bleary, I had to think about it. \u201cThick,\u201d I said. Then, \u201cThirsty.\u201d\n \nMola brought me a glass and helped me drink. It was sweet and gritty. It took me a long moment to finish it, but by the time I was done, I felt halfway human again.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cYou fainted in the Artificery,\u201d she said. \u201cKilvin carried you over here himself. It was rather touching, actually. I had to shoo him away.\u201d\nI felt my entire body flush with shame at the thought of being carried through the streets of the University by the huge master. I must have looked like a rag doll in his arms. \u201cI fainted?\u201d\n\u201cKilvin explained you were in a hot room,\u201d Mola said. \u201cAnd you\u2019d sweat through your clothes. You were dripping wet.\u201d She gestured to where my shirt and pants lay wadded on the table.\n\u201cHeat exhaustion?\u201d I said.\nMola held up a hand to quiet me. \u201cThat was my first diagnosis,\u201d she said. \u201cOn further examination, I\u2019ve decided you\u2019re actually suffering from an acute case of jumping out of a window last night.\u201d She gave me a pointed look.\nI suddenly became self-conscious. Not of my near-nakedness, but of the obvious injuries I\u2019d received when I\u2019d fallen off the roof of the Golden Pony. I glanced at the door and was relieved to see it was closed. Mola stood watching me, her expression carefully blank.\n\u201cHas anyone else seen?\u201d I asked.\nMola shook her head. \u201cWe\u2019ve been busy today.\u201d\nI relaxed a bit. \u201cThat\u2019s something then.\u201d\nHer expression was grim. \u201cThis morning, Arwyl gave orders to report any\nsuspicious injuries. It\u2019s no secret why. Ambrose himself has offered a sizable reward to whoever helps him catch a thief who broke into his rooms and stole several valuables, including a ring his mother gave him on her deathbed.\u201d\n\u201cThat bastard,\u201d I said hotly. \u201cI didn\u2019t steal anything.\u201d\nMola raised an eyebrow. \u201cAs easy as that? No denial? No . . . anything?\u201d\nI exhaled through my nose, trying to get my temper under control. \u201cI\u2019m not\ngoing to insult your intelligence. It\u2019s pretty obvious I didn\u2019t fall down some stairs.\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cLook, Mola. If you tell anyone, they\u2019ll expel me. I didn\u2019t steal anything. I could have, but I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cThen why . . .\u201d She hesitated, obviously uncomfortable. \u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d\nI sighed. \u201cWould you believe I was doing a favor for a friend?\u201d\nMola gave me a shrewd look, her green eyes searching mine. \u201cWell, you", "do seem to be in the favor business lately.\u201d\n\u201cI . . . what?\u201d I asked, my thoughts moving too sluggishly to follow what\nshe was saying.\n\u201cThe last time you were here, I treated you for burns and smoke inhalation\nafter pulling Fela out of a fire.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s not really a favor. Anyone would have done that.\u201d Mola gave me a searching look. \u201cYou really believe that, don\u2019t you?\u201d She\nshook her head a little, then picked up a hardback and made a few notes on it, no doubt filling out her treatment report. \u201cWell, I consider it a favor. Fela and I bunked together back when we were both new here. Despite what you think, it\u2019s not something a lot of people would have done.\u201d\nThere was a knock and Sim\u2019s voice came from the hallway. \u201cCan we come in?\u201d Without waiting for an answer, he opened the door and led an uncomfortable looking Wilem into the room.\n\u201cWe heard . . .\u201d Sim paused and turned to look at Mola. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be okay, right?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Mola said. \u201cProvided his temperature levels out.\u201d She picked up a key-gauge and stuck it in my mouth. \u201cI know this will be hard for you, but try to keep your mouth shut for a minute.\u201d\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d Simmon said with a grin, \u201cWe heard Kilvin took you somewhere private and showed you something that made you faint like a little sissy girl.\u201d\nI scowled at him, but kept my mouth shut.\nMola turned back to Wil and Sim. \u201cHis legs are going to hurt for a while, but there\u2019s no permanent damage. His elbow should be fine too, though the stitching\u2019s a mess. What the hell were you guys doing in Ambrose\u2019s rooms, anyway?\u201d\nWilem simply looked at her, characteristically dark-eyed and stoic.\nNo such luck with Sim. \u201cKvothe needed to get a ring for his ladylove,\u201d he chirped cheerfully.\nMola turned to look at me, her expression furious. \u201cYou have a hell of a lot of nerve to lie right to my face,\u201d she said, her eyes flat and angry as a cat\u2019s. \u201cThank goodness you didn\u2019t want to insult my intelligence or anything.\u201d\nI took a deep breath and reached up to take the key-gauge out of my mouth. \u201cGoddammit Sim,\u201d I said crossly. \u201cSome day I\u2019m going to teach you to lie.\u201d\nSim looked back and forth between the two of us, flushed with panic and", "embarrassment. \u201cKvothe has a thing for a girl over the river,\u201d he said defensively. \u201cAmbrose took a ring of hers and won\u2019t give it back. We just\u2014\u201d\nMola cut him off with a sharp gesture. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just tell me that?\u201d she demanded of me, irritated. \u201cEveryone knows what Ambrose is like with women!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t tell you,\u201d I said. \u201cIt sounded like a very convenient lie. There\u2019s also the fact that it is not one whit of your goddamn business.\u201d\nHer expression hardened. \u201cYou come off pretty high and mighty for\u2014\u201d\n\u201cStop. Just stop,\u201d Wilem said, startling both of us out of our argument. He turned to Mola, \u201cWhen Kvothe came here unconscious, what did you do first?\u201d\n\u201cI checked his pupils for signs of head trauma,\u201d Mola said automatically. \u201cWhat the hell does that have to do with anything?\u201d\nWilem gestured in my direction. \u201cLook at his eyes now.\u201d\nMola looked at me. \u201cThey\u2019re dark,\u201d she said, sounding surprised. \u201cDark green. Like a pine bough.\u201d\nWil continued. \u201cDon\u2019t argue with him when his eyes go dark like that. No good comes of it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the noise a rattlesnake makes,\u201d Sim said.\n\u201cMore like hackles on a dog, \u201dWilem corrected. \u201cIt shows when he\u2019s ready to bite.\u201d\n\u201cAll of you can go straight to hell,\u201d I said. \u201cOr you can give me a mirror so I can see what you\u2019re talking about. I don\u2019t care which.\u201d\nWil ignored me. \u201cOur little Kvothe has a flash-pan temper, but once he\u2019s had a minute to cool down, he will realize the truth.\u201d Wilem gave me a pointed look. \u201cHe\u2019s not upset because you didn\u2019t trust him, or that you tricked Sim. He\u2019s upset because you found out what asinine lengths he is willing to go to in order to impress a woman.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cIs asinine the right word?\u201d\nI took a deep breath and let it out. \u201cPretty much,\u201d I admitted.\n\u201cI chose it because it sounded like ass,\u201d Wil said.\n\u201cI knew you two had to be involved,\u201d Mola said with a hint of apology in\nher voice. \u201cHonestly, the three of you are thick as thieves, and I do mean that in all its various clever implications.\u201d She walked around the side of the bed and looked critically at my wounded elbow. \u201cWhich one of you stitched him up?\u201d\n\u201cMe.\u201d Sim grimaced. \u201cI know I made a mess of it.\u201d", "\u201cMess would be generous.\u201d Mola said, looking it over critically. \u201cIt looks like you were trying to stitch your name onto him and kept misspelling it.\u201d\n\u201cI think he did quite well,\u201d Wil said, meeting her eye. \u201cConsidering his lack of training, and the fact that he was helping a friend under less than ideal circumstances.\u201d\nMola flushed. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cWorking here, it\u2019s easy to forget that not everyone . . .\u201d She turned to Sim. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nSim ran his hand through his sandy hair. \u201cI suppose you could make it up to me sometime,\u201d he said, grinning boyishly. \u201cLike maybe tomorrow afternoon? When you let me buy you lunch?\u201d He looked at her hopefully.\nMola rolled her eyes and sighed, somewhere between amusement and exasperation. \u201cFine.\u201d\n\u201cMy work here is done,\u201dWil said gravely. \u201cI\u2019m leaving. I hate this place.\u201d \u201cThanks Wil,\u201d I said.\nHe gave a perfunctory wave over one shoulder and closed the door behind\nhim.\nMola agreed to leave mention of my suspicious injuries off her report and stuck to her original diagnosis of heat exhaustion. She also cut away Sim\u2019s stitches, then recleaned, resewed, and rebandaged my arm. Not a pleasant experience, but I knew it would heal more quickly under her experienced care.\nIn closing, she advised me to drink more water, get some sleep, and suggested that in the future I refrain from strenuous physical activity in a hot room the day after falling off a roof.\n \n"], "CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO": ["CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO\nSlipping\nUP UNTIL THIS POINT in the term, Elxa Dal had been teaching us theory in Adept Sympathy. How much light could be produced from ten thaums of continuous heat using iron? Using basalt? Using human flesh? We memorized tables of figures and learned how to calculate escalating squares, angular momentum, and compounded degradations.\nSimply said, it was mind-numbing.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I knew it was essential information. Bindings of the sort we\u2019d shown Denna were simple. But when things grew complicated, a skilled sympathist needed to do some fairly tricky calculations.\nIn terms of energy, there isn\u2019t much difference between lighting a candle and melting it into a puddle of tallow. The only difference is one of focus and control. When the candle is sitting in front of you, these things are easy. You simply stare at the wick and stop pouring in heat when you see the first flicker of flame. But if the candle is a quarter mile away, or in a different room, focus and control are exponentially more difficult to maintain.\nAnd there are worse things than melted candles waiting for a careless sympathist. The question Denna had asked in the Eolian was all-important: \u201cWhere does the extra energy go?\u201d\nAs Wil had explained, some went into the air, some went into the linked items, and the rest went into the sympathist\u2019s body. The technical term for it was \u201cthaumic overfill,\u201d but even Elxa Dal tended to refer to it as slippage.\nEvery year or so some careless sympathist with a strong Alar channeled enough heat through a bad link to spike his body temperature and drive himself fever-mad. Dal told us of one extreme case where a student managed to cook himself from the inside out.\nI mentioned the last to Manet the day after Dal shared the story with our class. I expected him to join me in some healthy scoffing, but it turned out Manet had actually been a student back when it had happened.\n\u201cSmelled like pork,\u201d Manet said grimly. \u201cDamnedest thing. Felt bad for", "him of course, but you can only feel so much pity for an idiot. A little slippage here and there, you hardly notice, but he must have slipped two hundred thousand thaums inside two seconds.\u201d Manet shook his head, not looking up from the piece of tin he was engraving. \u201cWhole wing of Mains reeked. Nobody could use those rooms for a year.\u201d\nI stared at him.\n\u201cThermal slippage is fairly common though,\u201d Manet continued. \u201cNow kinetic slippage . . .\u201d He raised his eyebrows appreciatively. \u201cTwenty years back some damn fool El\u2019the got drunk and tried to lift a manure cart onto the roof of the Masters\u2019 Hall on a bet. Tore his own arm off at the shoulder.\u201d\nManet bent back over his piece of tin, engraving a careful rune. \u201cTakes a special kind of stupid to do something like that.\u201d\nThe next day I was especially attentive to what Dal had to say.\nHe drilled us mercilessly. Calculations for enthaupy. Charts showing distance of decay. Equations that described the entropic curves a skilled sympathist needs to understand on an almost instinctive level.\nBut Dal was no fool. So before we grew bored and sloppy, he turned it into a competition.\nHe made us draw heat from odd sources, from red-hot irons, from blocks of ice, from our own blood. Lighting candles in distant rooms was the easiest of it. Lighting one of a dozen identical candles was harder. Lighting a candle you\u2019d never actually seen in an unknown location . . . it was like juggling in the dark.\nThere were contests of precision. Contests of finesse. Contests of focus and control. After two span, I was the highest ranked student in our class of twenty-three Re\u2019lar. Fenton nipped at my heels in second place.\nAs luck would have it, the day after my assault on Ambrose\u2019s rooms was the same day we began dueling in Adept Sympathy. Dueling required all the subtlety and control of our previous competitions, with the added challenge of having another student actively opposing your Alar.\nSo, despite my recent trip to the Medica for heat exhaustion, I melted a hole through a block of ice in a distant room. Despite two nights of scant sleep, I raised the temperature of a pint of mercury exactly ten degrees. Despite my throbbing bruises and the stinging itch of my bandaged arm, I tore the king of spades in half while leaving the other cards in the deck untouched.\nAll of these things I did in less than two minutes, despite the fact that", "Fenton set the whole of his Alar to oppose me. It is not for nothing that they came to call me Kvothe the Arcane. My Alar was like a blade of Ramston steel.\n\u201cIt\u2019s rather impressive,\u201d Dal said to me after class. \u201cIt\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve had a student go undefeated for so long. Will anyone even bet against you anymore?\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cThat dried up a long time ago.\u201d\n\u201cThe price of fame.\u201d Dal smiled, then looked a little more serious. \u201cI wanted to warn you before I announce it to the class. Next span I\u2019ll probably start setting students against you in pairs.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to go against Fenton and Brey at the same time?\u201d I asked.\nDal shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019ll start with the two lowest ranked duelists. It will be a nice lead-in to the teamwork exercises we\u2019ll be doing later in the term.\u201d He smiled. \u201cAnd it will keep you from growing complacent.\u201d Dal gave me a sharp look, his smile fading. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d\n\u201cJust a chill,\u201d I said unconvincingly as I shivered. \u201cCould we go stand by the brazier?\u201d\nI stood as close as I could without pressing myself against the hot metal, spreading my hands over the glimmering bowl of hot coals. After a moment the chill passed and I noticed Dal looking at me curiously.\n\u201cI ended up in the Medica with a bit of heat exhaustion earlier today,\u201d I admitted. \u201cMy body\u2019s just a bit confused. I\u2019m fine now.\u201d\nHe frowned. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t come to class if you aren\u2019t feeling well,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you certainly shouldn\u2019t be dueling. Sympathy of this sort stresses the body and mind. You shouldn\u2019t risk compounding that with an illness.\u201d\n\u201cI felt fine when I came to class,\u201d I lied. \u201cMy body is just reminding me I owe it a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d\n\u201cSee that you give it one,\u201d he said sternly, spreading his own hands to the fire. \u201cIf you drive yourself too hard you\u2019ll pay for it later. You\u2019ve been looking a little ragged lately. Ragged isn\u2019t the right word, really.\u201d\n\u201cWeary?\u201d I guessed.\n\u201cYes. Weary.\u201d He eyed me speculatively, smoothing his beard with a hand. \u201cYou have a gift for words. It\u2019s one of the reasons you ended up with Elodin,\n \nI expect.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t say anything to that. I must have said it quite loudly too, because\nDal gave me a curious look. \u201cHow are your studies progressing with Elodin?\u201d he asked casually.\n\u201cWell enough,\u201d I hedged.\nHe looked at me.\n\u201cNot as well as I might hope,\u201d I admitted. \u201cStudying with Master Elodin\nisn\u2019t what I expected.\u201d\nDal nodded. \u201cHe can be difficult.\u201d\nA question sprang up in me. \u201cDo you know any names, Master Dal?\u201d He nodded solemnly.\n\u201cWhat are they?\u201d I pressed.\nHe stiffened slightly, then relaxed as he turned his hands back and forth\nover the fire. \u201cThat isn\u2019t really a polite question,\u201d he said gently. \u201cWell, not impolite, it\u2019s just the sort of question you don\u2019t ask. Like asking a man how often he makes love to his wife.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cNo need to be,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for you to know. It\u2019s a holdover from older times, I think. Back when we had more to fear from our fellow arcanists. If you knew what names your enemy knew, you could guess his strengths, his weaknesses.\u201d\nWe were both silent for a moment, warming ourselves by the coals. \u201cFire,\u201d he said after a long moment. \u201cI know the name of fire. And one other.\u201d\n\u201cOnly two?\u201d I blurted without thinking.\n\u201cAnd how many do you know?\u201d He mocked me gently. \u201cYes, only two. But two is a great number of names to know these days. Elodin says it was different, long ago.\u201d\n\u201cHow many does Elodin know?\u201d\n\u201cEven if I knew, it would be exceptionally bad form for me to tell you that,\u201d he said with a hint of disapproval. \u201cBut it\u2019s safe to say he knows a few.\u201d\n\u201cCould you show me something with the name of fire?\u201d I asked. \u201cIf that\u2019s not inappropriate?\u201d\nDal hesitated for a moment, then smiled. He looked intently into the brazier between us, closed his eyes, then gestured to the unlit brazier across the room. \u201cFire.\u201d He spoke the word like a commandment and the distant brazier roared up in a pillar of flame.", "\u201cFire?\u201d I said puzzled. \u201cThat\u2019s it? The name of fire is fire?\u201d\nElxa Dal smiled and shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I actually said. Some part of you just filled in a familiar word.\u201d\n\u201cMy sleeping mind translated it?\u201d\n\u201cSleeping mind?\u201d He gave me a puzzled look.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Elodin calls the part of us that knows names,\u201d I explained. Dal shrugged and ran a hand over his short black beard. \u201cCall it what you\nwill. The fact that you heard me say anything is probably a good sign.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m bothering with naming sometimes,\u201d I groused. \u201cI\ncould have lit that brazier with sympathy.\u201d\n\u201cNot without a link,\u201d Dal pointed out. \u201cWithout a binding, a source of\nenergy . . .\u201d\n\u201cIt still seems pointless,\u201d I said. \u201cI learn things every day in your class.\nUseful things. I don\u2019t have a thing to show for all the time I\u2019ve spent on naming. Yesterday you know what Elodin lectured about?\u201d\nDal shook his head.\n\u201cThe difference between being naked and being nude,\u201d I said flatly. Dal burst into laughter. \u201cI\u2019m serious. I fought to be in his class, but now all I can do is think about all the time I\u2019m wasting there, time I could be spending on more practical things.\u201d\n\u201cThere are things more practical than names,\u201d Dal admitted. \u201cBut watch.\u201d He focused on the brazier in front of us again, then his eyes grew distant. He spoke again, whispering this time, then slowly lowered his hand until it was inches above the hot coals.\nThen, with an intent expression on his face, Dal pressed his hand deep into the heart of the fire, nestling his spread fingers into the orange coals as if they were nothing more than loose gravel.\nI realized I was holding my breath and let it out softly, not wanting to break his concentration. \u201cHow?\u201d\n\u201cNames,\u201d Dal said firmly, and drew his hand back out of the fire. It was smudged with white ash, but perfectly unharmed. \u201cNames reflect true understanding of a thing, and when you truly understand a thing you have power over it.\u201d\n\u201cBut fire isn\u2019t a thing unto itself,\u201d I protested. \u201cIt\u2019s merely an exothermal chemical reaction. It . . .\u201d I spluttered to a stop.\nDal drew in a breath, and for a moment it looked as if he would explain. Then he laughed instead, shrugging helplessly. \u201cI don\u2019t have the wit to", "explain it to you. Ask Elodin. He\u2019s the one who claims to understand these things. I just work here.\u201d\nAfter Dal\u2019s class, I made my way over the river to Imre. I didn\u2019t find Denna at the inn where she was staying, so I headed to the Eolian despite the fact that I knew it was too early to find her there.\nThere were barely a dozen people inside, but I did see a familiar face at the far end of the bar, talking to Stanchion. Count Threpe waved, and I walked over to join them.\n\u201cKvothe my boy!\u201d Threpe said enthusiastically. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in a mortal age.\u201d\n\u201cThings have been rather hectic on the other side of the river,\u201d I said, setting down my lute case.\nStanchion looked me over. \u201cYou look it,\u201d he said frankly. \u201cYou look pale. You should get more red meat. Or more sleep.\u201d He pointed to a nearby stool. \u201cBarring that, I\u2019ll stand you a mug of metheglin.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll thank you for that,\u201d I said, climbing onto a stool. It felt wonderful to take the weight off my aching legs.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s meat and sleep you need,\u201d Threpe said ingratiatingly. \u201cYou should come to dinner at my estate. I promise wonderful food and conversation so dull you can drowse straight through it and not worry about missing a thing.\u201d He gave me an imploring look. \u201cCome now. I\u2019ll beg if I must. It won\u2019t be more than ten people. I\u2019ve been dying to show you off for months now.\u201d\nI picked up the mug of metheglin and looked at Threpe. His velvet jacket was a royal blue, and his suede boots were dyed to match. I couldn\u2019t show up for a formal dinner at his home dressed in secondhand road clothes, which were the only sort I owned.\nThere was nothing ostentatious about Threpe, but he was a noble born and raised. It probably didn\u2019t even occur to him that I didn\u2019t have any fine clothes. I didn\u2019t blame him for assuming that. The vast majority of the students at the University were at least modestly wealthy. How else could they afford tuition?\nThe truth was, I\u2019d like nothing better than a fine dinner and the chance to interact with some of the local nobility. I\u2019d love to banter over drinks, repair\n \nsome of the damage Ambrose had done to my reputation, and maybe catch the eye of a potential patron.\nBut I simply couldn\u2019t afford the price of admission. A suit of passably fine clothes would cost at least a talent and a half, even if I bought them from a fripperer. Clothes do not make the man, but you need the proper costume if you want to play the part.\nSitting behind Threpe, Stanchion made an exaggerated nodding motion with his head.\n\u201cI\u2019d love to come to dinner,\u201d I said to Threpe. \u201cI promise. Just as soon as things settle down a bit over at the University.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d Threpe said enthusiastically. \u201cI\u2019m going to hold you to it, too. No backing out. I\u2019ll get you a patron, my boy. A proper one. I swear it.\u201d\nBehind him, Stanchion nodded approvingly.\nI smiled at both of them and took another drink of metheglin. I glanced at the stairway to the second tier.\nStanchion saw my look. \u201cShe\u2019s not here,\u201d he said apologetically. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen her in a couple days, actually.\u201d\nA handful of people came through the door of the Eolian and shouted something in Yllish. Stanchion waved at them and got to his feet. \u201cDuty calls,\u201d he said, wandering off to greet them.\n\u201cSpeaking of patrons,\u201d I said to Threpe. \u201cThere\u2019s something I\u2019ve been wanting to ask your opinion about.\u201d I lowered my voice. \u201cSomething I\u2019d rather you kept between the two of us.\u201d\nThrepe\u2019s eyes glittered curiously as he leaned close.\nI took another drink of metheglin while I gathered my thoughts. The drink was hitting me more quickly than I\u2019d expected. It was quite nice, actually, as it dulled the ache of my many injuries. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you know most every potential patron within a hundred miles of here.\u201d\nThrepe shrugged, not bothering with false modesty. \u201cA fair number. Everyone who\u2019s earnest about it. Everyone with money, anyway.\u201d\n\u201cI have a friend,\u201d I said. \u201cA musician who is just starting out. She has natural talent but not much training. Someone has approached her with an offer of help and a promise of eventual patronage. . . .\u201d I trailed off, not sure how to explain the rest.\nThrepe nodded. \u201cYou want to know if he\u2019s a legitimate sort,\u201d he said. \u201cReasonable concern. Some folk feel a patron has a right to more than music.\u201d He gestured to Stanchion. \u201cIf you want stories, ask him about the", "time Duchess Samista came here on holiday.\u201d He gave a chuckle that was almost a moan, rubbing at his eyes. \u201cTiny gods help me, that woman was terrifying.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s my worry,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s trustworthy.\u201d\n\u201cI can ask around if you like,\u201d Threpe said. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the issue,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t know his name. I don\u2019t think she\nknows it either.\u201d\nThrepe frowned at this. \u201cHow can she not know his name?\u201d \u201cHe gave her a name,\u201d I said. \u201cBut she doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s real.\nApparently he\u2019s particular about his privacy and gave her strict instructions never to tell anyone about him,\u201d I said. \u201cThey never meet in the same place twice. Never in public. He\u2019s gone for months at a time.\u201d I looked up at Threpe. \u201cHow does that sound to you?\u201d\n\u201cWell it\u2019s hardly ideal,\u201d Threpe said, disapproval heavy in his voice. \u201cThere\u2019s every chance this fellow isn\u2019t a proper patron at all. It sounds like he might be taking advantage of your friend.\u201d\nI nodded glumly. \u201cThat was my thought too.\u201d\n\u201cThen again,\u201d Threpe said, \u201csome patrons do work in secret. If they find someone with talent, it\u2019s not unknown for them to nurture them in private, and then . . .\u201d He made a dramatic flourish with one hand. \u201cIt\u2019s like a magic trick. You suddenly produce a brilliant musician out of thin air.\u201d\nThrepe gave me a fond smile. \u201cI thought that\u2019s what someone had done with you,\u201d he admitted. \u201cYou came out of nowhere and got your pipes. I thought someone had been keeping you hidden away until you were ready to make your grand appearance.\u201d\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that,\u201d I said.\n\u201cIt does happen,\u201d Threpe said. \u201cBut strange meeting places and the fact that she\u2019s not sure of his name?\u201d He shook his head, frowning. \u201cIf nothing else, it\u2019s rather indecorous. Either this fellow is having a bit of fun pretending to be an outlaw, or he\u2019s genuinely dodgy.\u201d\nThrepe seemed to think for a moment, tapping his fingers on the bar. \u201cTell your friend to be careful and keep her wits about her. It\u2019s a terrible thing when a patron takes advantage of a woman. That\u2019s a betrayal. But I\u2019ve known men who did little but pose as patrons to gain a woman\u2019s trust.\u201d He frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s worse.\u201d\n \nI was halfway back to the University, with Stonebridge just beginning to loom in the distance, when I began to feel an unpleasant prickling heat run up my arm. At first I thought it was the pain of the twice-stitched cuts on my elbow, as they\u2019d been itching and burning all day.\nBut instead of fading, the heat continued to spread up my arm and along the left side of my chest. I began to sweat, as if from a sudden fever.\nI stripped off my cloak, letting the chill air cool me, and began to unbutton my shirt. The autumn breeze helped, and I fanned myself with my cloak. But the heat grew more intense, painful even, as if I\u2019d spilled boiling water across my chest.\nLuckily, this section of road ran parallel to a stream that fed into the nearby Omethi River. Unable to think of a better plan, I kicked off my boots, unshouldered my lute, and jumped into the water.\nThe chill of the stream made me gasp and sputter, but it cooled my burning skin. I stayed there, trying not to feel like an idiot while a young couple walked past, holding hands and pointedly ignoring me.\nThe strange heat moved through my body, like there was a fire inside me trying to find a way out. It started along my left side, then wandered down to my legs, then back up to my left arm. When it moved to my head, I ducked underwater.\nIt stopped after a few minutes, and I climbed out of the stream. Shivering, I wrapped myself in my cloak, glad no one else was on the road. Then, since there was nothing else to do, I shouldered my lute case and began the long walk back to the University dripping wet and terribly afraid.", ""], "CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE": ["CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE\nPrinciples\n\u201cI DID TELL MOLA,\u201d I said as I shuffled the cards. \u201cShe said it was all in my head and pushed me out the door.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I can only guess what that feels like,\u201d Sim said bitterly.\nI looked up, surprised by the uncharacteristic sharpness in his voice, but before I could ask what was the matter, Wilem caught my eye and shook his head, warning me away. Knowing Sim\u2019s history, I guessed it was another quick, painful end to another quick, painful relationship.\nI kept my mouth shut and dealt another hand of breath. The three of us were killing time, waiting for the room to fill up before I started playing for my typical Felling night crowd at Anker\u2019s.\n\u201cWhat do you think is the matter?\u201dWilem asked.\nI hesitated, worried that if I spoke my fears aloud it might somehow make them true. \u201cI might have exposed myself to something dangerous in the Fishery.\u201d\nWil looked at me. \u201cSuch as?\u201d\n\u201cSome of the compounds we use,\u201d I said. \u201cThey\u2019ll go straight through your skin and kill you in eighteen slow ways.\u201d I thought back to the day my tenten glass had cracked in the Fishery. Of the single drop of transporting agent that had landed on my shirt. It was only a tiny drop, barely larger than the head of a nail. I was so certain it hadn\u2019t touched my skin. \u201cI hope that\u2019s not it. But I don\u2019t know what else it might be.\u201d\n\u201cIt could be a lingering effect from the plum bob,\u201d Sim said grimly. \u201cAmbrose isn\u2019t much of an alchemist. And from what I understand, one of the main ingredients is lead. If he factored it himself, some latent principles could be affecting your system. Did you eat or drink anything different today?\u201d\nI thought about it. \u201cI had a fair bit of metheglin at the Eolian,\u201d I admitted. \u201cThat stuff will make anyone ill,\u201d Wil said darkly.\n\u201cI like it,\u201d Sim said. \u201cBut it\u2019s practically a nostrum all by itself. There\u2019s a", "lot of different tincturing going on in there. Nothing alchemical, but you\u2019ve got nutmeg, thyme, clove\u2014all manner of spices. Could be that one of them triggered some of the free principles lurking in your system.\u201d\n\u201cWonderful,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cAnd how do I go about fixing that, exactly?\u201d Sim spread his hands helplessly.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d I said. \u201cStill, it sounds better than metal\npoisoning.\u201d\nSimmon proceeded to take four tricks in a row with a clever card force,\nand by the end of the hand he was smiling again. Sim was never really given to extended brooding.\nWil squared his cards away, and I pushed my chair back from the table. \u201cPlay the one about the drunk cow and the butter churn,\u201d Sim said.\nI couldn\u2019t help but crack a smile. \u201cMaybe later,\u201d I said as I picked up my\nincreasingly shabby lute case and made my way to the hearth amid the sound of scattered, familiar applause. It took me a long moment to open the case, untwisting the copper wire I was still using in place of a buckle.\nFor the next two hours I played. I sang: \u201cCopper Bottom Pot,\u201d \u201cLilac Bough,\u201d and \u201cAunt Emme\u2019s Tub.\u201d The audience laughed and clapped and cheered. As I fingered my way through the songs, I felt my worries slough away. My music has always been the best remedy for my dark moods. As I sang, even my bruises seemed to pain me less.\nThen I felt a chill, as if a strong winter wind was blowing down the chimney behind me. I fought off a shiver and finished the last verse of \u201cApplejack,\u201d which I\u2019d finally played to keep Sim happy. When I struck the last chord, the crowd applauded and conversation slowly welled up to fill the room again.\nI looked behind me at the fireplace, but the fire was burning cheerfully with no sign of a draft. I stepped down off the hearth, hoping a little walk would chase my chill away. But as soon as I took a few steps, I realized that wasn\u2019t the case. The cold settled straight into my bones. I turned back to the fireplace, spreading my hands to warm them.\nWil and Sim appeared at my side. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Sim asked. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re going to be sick.\u201d\n\u201cSomething like that,\u201d I said, clenching my teeth to keep them from chattering. \u201cGo tell Anker I\u2019m feeling ill and have to cut it short tonight. Then light a candle off this fire and bring it up to my room.\u201d I looked up at their serious faces. \u201cWil, can you help me get out of here? I don\u2019t want to", "make a scene.\u201d\nWilem nodded and gave me his arm. I leaned on him and concentrated on\nkeeping my body from shaking as we made our way to the stairs. No one paid us much attention. I probably looked more drunk than anything. My hands were numb and heavy. My lips felt icy cold.\nAfter the first flight of stairs, I couldn\u2019t keep my shaking under control any longer. I could still walk, but the thick muscles in my legs twitched with every step.\nWil stopped. \u201cWe should go the Medica.\u201d While he didn\u2019t sound different, his Cealdish accent was thicker, and he was starting to drop words. A sign he was genuinely worried.\nI shook my head firmly and leaned forward, knowing he\u2019d have to help me up the stairs or let me fall. Wilem put an arm around me and half-steadied, half-carried me the rest of the way.\nOnce in my tiny room, I staggered onto the bed. Wil wrapped a blanket around my shoulders.\nThere were footsteps in the hallway and Sim peered nervously around the door. He held a stub of candle, sheltering the flame with his other hand as he walked. \u201cI\u2019ve got it. What do you want it for, anyway?\u201d\n\u201cThere.\u201d I pointed to the table beside the bed. \u201cYou lit it off the fire?\u201d\nSim\u2019s eyes were frightened. \u201cYour lips,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not a good color.\u201d\nI pried a splinter from the rough wood of the bedside table and jabbed it hard into the back of my hand. Blood welled up and I rolled the long splinter around in it, getting it wet. \u201cClose the door,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou are not doing what I think you\u2019re doing,\u201d Sim said firmly.\nI jabbed the long splinter down into the soft wax of the candle alongside the burning wick. It sputtered a little bit, then the flame wrapped around it. I muttered two bindings, one right after the other, speaking slowly so my numb lips didn\u2019t slur the words.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Sim demanded. \u201cAre you trying to cook yourself?\u201d When I didn\u2019t answer him, he stepped forward as if he would knock the candle over.\nWil caught his arm. \u201cHis hands are like ice,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cHe\u2019s cold. Really cold.\u201d\nSim\u2019s eyes darted nervously between the two of us. He took a step back. \u201cJust . . . just be careful.\u201d", "But I was already ignoring him. I closed my eyes and bound the candle flame to the fire downstairs. Then I carefully made the second connection between the blood on the splinter and the blood in my body. It was very much like what I\u2019d done with the drop of wine at the Eolian. With the obvious exception that I didn\u2019t want my blood to boil.\nAt first there was just a brief tickle of heat, not nearly enough. I concentrated harder and felt my entire body relax as warmth flooded through me. I kept my eyes closed, keeping my attention on the bindings until I could take several long, deep breaths without any shuddering or shaking.\nI opened my eyes and saw my two friends looking on expectantly. I smiled at them. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d\nBut before I got the words out, I began to sweat. I was suddenly too warm, nauseatingly warm. I broke both bindings as quickly as you jerk your hand away from a hot iron stove.\nI took a few deep breaths, then got to my feet and walked over to the window. I opened it and leaned heavily on the sill, enjoying the chill autumn air that smelled of dead leaves and coming rain.\nThere was a long moment of silence.\n\u201cThat looked like binder\u2019s chills,\u201d Simmon said. \u201cReally bad binder\u2019s chills.\u201d\n\u201cIt felt like the chills,\u201d I said.\n\u201cMaybe your body has lost the ability to regulate its own temperate?\u201d Wilem suggested.\n\u201cTemperature,\u201d Sim corrected him absently.\n\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t account for the burn across my chest,\u201d I said.\nSim cocked his head. \u201cBurn?\u201d\nI was wet with sweat now, so I was glad for an excuse to unbutton my shirt\nand pull it off over my head. A large portion of my chest and upper arm was a bright red, a sharp contrast to my ordinarily pale skin. \u201cMola said it was a rash, and I was being fussy as an old woman. But it wasn\u2019t there before I jumped into the river.\u201d\nSimmon leaned close to look. \u201cI still think it\u2019s unbound principles,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can do bizarre things to a person. We had an E\u2019lir last term that wasn\u2019t careful with his factoring. He ending up not being able to sleep or focus his eyes for almost two span.\u201d\nWilem slouched into a chair. \u201cWhat makes a man cold, then hot, then cold again?\u201d", "Sim gave a halfhearted smile. \u201cSounds like a riddle.\u201d\n\u201cI hate riddles,\u201d I said, reaching for my shirt. Then I yelped, clutching at the bare bicep of my left arm. Blood welled out between my fingers.\nSim bolted to his feet, looking around frantically, obviously at a loss for what to do.\nIt felt like I\u2019d been stabbed by an invisible knife. \u201cGod. Blackened. Damn.\u201d I gritted out between my clenched teeth. I pulled my hand away and saw the small, round wound in my arm that had come from nowhere.\nSimmon\u2019s expression was horrified, his eyes wide, his hands covering his mouth. He said something, but I was too busy concentrating to listen. I already knew what he was saying, anyway: malfeasance. Of course. This was all malfeasance. Someone was attacking me.\nI lowered myself into the Heart of Stone and brought all my Alar to bear.\nBut my unknown attacker wasn\u2019t wasting any time. There was a sharp pain in my chest near the shoulder. It didn\u2019t break the skin this time, but I watched a blotch of dark blue blossom under my skin.\nI hardened my Alar and the next stab was little more than a pinch. Then I quickly broke my mind into three pieces and gave two of them the job of maintaining the Alar that protected me.\nOnly then did I let out a deep sigh. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\nSimmon gave a laugh that choked off into a sob. His hands still covered his mouth. \u201cHow can you say that?\u201d he demanded, plainly horrified.\nI looked down at myself. Blood was still welling up through my fingers, running down the back of my hand and my arm.\n\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d I said to him. \u201cHonestly, Sim.\u201d\n\u201cBut malfeasance,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just isn\u2019t done.\u201d\nI sat down on the edge of my bed, keeping pressure on my wound. \u201cI think\nwe have some pretty clear proof otherwise.\u201d\nWilem sat back down. \u201cI am with Simmon. I would never have believed\nthis.\u201d He made an angry gesture. \u201cArcanists do not do this anymore. It is insane.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cWhy are you smiling?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m relieved,\u201d I said honestly. \u201cI was worried I\u2019d given myself cadmium poisoning, or I had some mysterious disease. This is just someone trying to kill me.\u201d\n\u201cHow could someone do it?\u201d Simmon asked. \u201cI don\u2019t mean morally. How did someone get hold of your blood or hair?\u201d\nWilem looked at Simmon. \u201cWhat did you do with the bandages after you", "stitched him up?\u201d\n\u201cI burned them,\u201d Sim said defensively. \u201cI\u2019m not an idiot.\u201d\nWil made a calming gesture. \u201cI\u2019m just narrowing our options. It probably\nisn\u2019t the Medica either. They\u2019re careful about that sort of thing.\u201d Simmon stood up. \u201cWe have to tell someone.\u201d He looked at Wilem.\n\u201cWould Jamison still be in his office at this time of night?\u201d\n\u201cSim,\u201d I said. \u201cHow about we just wait for a while?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Simmon said. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cThe only evidence I have are my injuries,\u201d I said. \u201cThat means they\u2019ll\nwant someone at the Medica to examine me. And when that happens . . .\u201d With one hand still clamped over my bloody arm, I waved my bandaged elbow. \u201cI look remarkably like someone who fell off a roof just a couple days ago.\u201d\nSim\u2019s sat back down in his chair. \u201cIt\u2019s only been three days, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cI\u2019d be expelled. And Mola would be in trouble for not mentioning my injuries. Master Arwyl isn\u2019t forgiving about that sort of thing. The two of you would probably be implicated too. I don\u2019t want that.\u201d\nWe were quiet for a moment. The only sound was the distant clamor of the busy taproom below. I sat down on the bed.\n\u201cDo we even need to discuss who\u2019s doing this?\u201d Sim asked.\n\u201cAmbrose,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s always Ambrose. He must have found some of my blood on a piece of roofing tile. I should have thought of that days ago.\u201d\n\u201cHow would he know it was yours?\u201d Simmon asked.\n\u201cBecause I hate him,\u201d I said bitterly. \u201cOf course he knows it was me.\u201d Wil was slowly shaking his head. \u201cNo. It\u2019s not like him.\u201d\n\u201cNot like him?\u201d Simmon demanded. \u201cHe had that woman dose Kvothe\nwith the plum bob. That\u2019s as bad as poison. He hired those men to jump Kvothe in the alley last term.\u201d\n\u201cMy point exactly,\u201d Wilem said. \u201cAmbrose doesn\u2019t do things to Kvothe. He arranges for other people to do them. He got some woman to dose him. He paid thugs to knife you. I expect he didn\u2019t even do that, really. I\u2019ll bet someone else set it up for him.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all the same,\u201d I said. \u201cWe know he\u2019s behind it.\u201d\nWilem frowned at me. \u201cYou\u2019re not thinking straight. It\u2019s not that Ambrose isn\u2019t a bastard. He is. But he\u2019s a clever bastard. He\u2019s careful to distance himself from anything he does.\u201d\nSim looked uncertain. \u201cWil has a point. When you were hired on as house", "musician at the Horse and Four, he didn\u2019t buy the place and fire you. He had Baron Petre\u2019s son-in-law do it. No connection to him at all.\u201d\n\u201cNo connection here either,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point of sympathy. It\u2019s indirect.\u201d\nWil shook his head again. \u201cIf you got knifed in an alley people would be shocked. But such things happen all the time all over the world. But if you fell down in public and started gushing blood from malfeasance? People would be horrified. The masters would suspend classes. Rich merchants and nobles would hear of it and pull their children from their studies. They\u2019d bring the constables over from Imre.\u201d\nSimmon rubbed his forehead and looked up at the ceiling thoughtfully. Then he nodded to himself, first slowly, then with more certainty. \u201cIt makes sense,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Ambrose had found some blood, he could have turned it over to Jamison and had him dowse out the thief. There wouldn\u2019t have been any need to get folks in the Medica to look for suspicious injuries and such.\u201d\n\u201cAmbrose likes his revenge,\u201d I pointed out grimly. \u201cHe could have hidden the blood from Jamison. Kept it for himself.\u201d\nWilem was shaking his head.\nSim sighed. \u201cWil\u2019s right. There aren\u2019t that many sympathists, and everyone knows Ambrose is carrying a grudge against you. He\u2019s too careful to do something like this. It would point right to him.\u201d\n\u201cBesides,\u201d Wilem said. \u201cHow long has this been going on? Days and days. Do you honestly think Ambrose could go this long without rubbing your nose in it? Not even a little?\u201d\n\u201cYou have a point,\u201d I admitted reluctantly. \u201cThat\u2019s not like him.\u201d\nI knew it had to be Ambrose. I could feel it deep in my gut. In a strange way I almost wanted it to be him. It would make things so much simpler.\nBut wanting something doesn\u2019t make it so. I took a deep breath and forced myself to think about it rationally.\n\u201cIt would be reckless of him,\u201d I admitted at last. \u201cAnd he isn\u2019t the sort to get his hands dirty.\u201d I sighed. \u201cFine. Wonderful. As if one person trying to ruin my life wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d\n\u201cWho could it be?\u201d Simmon asked. \u201cYour average person can\u2019t do this sort of thing with hair, am I right?\u201d\n\u201cDal could,\u201d I said. \u201cOr Kilvin.\u201d\n\u201cIt is probably safe to assume,\u201d Wilem said dryly, \u201cthat none of the masters are trying to kill you.\u201d", "\u201cThen it has to be someone with his blood,\u201d Sim said.\nI tried to ignore the sinking sensation in the pit of my stomach. \u201cThere is someone with my blood,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think she could be responsible.\u201d\nWil and Sim turned to look at me, and I immediately regretted saying anything. \u201cWhy would someone have your blood?\u201d Sim asked.\nI hesitated, then realized there was no way to avoid telling them at this point. \u201cI borrowed money from Devi at the beginning of the term.\u201d\nNeither one of them reacted the way I expected. Which is to say, neither one reacted at all.\n\u201cWho\u2019s Devi?\u201d Sim asked.\nI started to relax. Maybe they hadn\u2019t heard of her. That would certainly make things easier. \u201cShe\u2019s a gaelet who lives across the river,\u201d I said.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Simmon said easily. \u201cWhat\u2019s a gaelet?\u201d\n\u201cRemember when we went to see The Ghost and the Goosegirl?\u201d I asked him. \u201cKetler was a gaelet.\u201d\n\u201cOh, a copper hawk,\u201d Sim said, his face brightening with realization, then darkening again as he realized the implications. \u201cI didn\u2019t know there were any of those sort of people around here.\u201d\n\u201cThose sort of people are everywhere,\u201d I said. \u201cThe world wouldn\u2019t work without them.\u201d\n\u201cWait,\u201d Wilem said suddenly, holding up his hand. \u201cDid you say, your . . .\u201d He paused, struggling to remember the appropriate word in Aturan. \u201cYour loaner, your gatessor was named Devi?\u201d His Cealdish accent was thick around her name, so it sounded like \u201cDavid.\u201d\nI nodded. This was the reaction I\u2019d expected.\n\u201cOh God,\u201d Simmon said, aghast. \u201cYou mean Demon Devi, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nI sighed. \u201cSo you\u2019ve heard of her.\u201d\n\u201cHeard of her?\u201d Sim said, his voice going shrill. \u201cShe was expelled during\nmy first term! It left a real impression.\u201d\nWilem simply closed his eyes and shook his head, as if he couldn\u2019t bear to\nlook at someone as stupid as me.\nSim threw his hands into the air. \u201cShe was expelled for malfeasance! What\nwere you thinking?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201dWilem said to Simmon. \u201cShe was expelled for Conduct\nUnbecoming. There was no proof of malfeasance.\u201d\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think it was her,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019s quite nice, actually.\nFriendly. Besides, it\u2019s only a six talent loan, and I\u2019m not late paying her back.", "She doesn\u2019t have any reason to do something like this.\u201d\nWilem gave me a long, steady look. \u201cJust to explore all possibilities,\u201d he\nsaid slowly. \u201cWould you do something for me?\u201d I nodded.\n\u201cThink back on your last few conversings with her,\u201d Wilem said. \u201cTake a moment and sift them piece by piece and see if you remember doing or saying something that might have offended or upset her.\u201d\nI thought back on our last conversation, playing it through in my head. \u201cShe was interested in a certain piece of information that I didn\u2019t give her.\u201d\n\u201cHow interested?\u201d Wilem\u2019s voice was slow and patient, as if he were talking to a rather dimwitted child.\n\u201cRather interested,\u201d I said.\n\u201cRather does not indicate a degree of intensity.\u201d\nI sighed. \u201cFine. Extremely interested. Interested enough to\u2014\u201d I stopped. Wilem arched a knowing eyebrow at me. \u201cYes? What have you just\nremembered?\u201d\nI hesitated. \u201cShe might have also offered to sleep with me,\u201d I said. Wilem nodded calmly, as if he had expected something of the sort. \u201cAnd\nyou responded to this young woman\u2019s generous offer in what way?\u201d\nI felt my cheeks get hot. \u201cI . . . I sort of just ignored it.\u201d\nWilem closed his eyes, his expression conveying a vast, weary dismay. \u201cThis is so much worse than Ambrose,\u201d Sim said, putting his head in his\nhands. \u201cDevi doesn\u2019t have to worry about the masters or anything. They say she could do an eight-part binding! Eight!\u201d\n\u201cI was in a tight space,\u201d I said a little testily. \u201cI didn\u2019t have anything to use as collateral. I\u2019ll admit it wasn\u2019t a great idea. After all this is done, we can have a symposium on how stupid I am. But for now can we just move on?\u201d I gave them a pleading look.\nWilem rubbed at his eyes with one hand and gave a weary nod.\nSimmon made an effort to get rid of his horrified expression with only marginal success. He swallowed. \u201cFair enough. What are we going to do?\u201d\n\u201cRight now it doesn\u2019t really matter who is responsible,\u201d I said, cautiously checking to see if my arm had stopped bleeding. It had, and I peeled my bloody hand away. \u201cI\u2019m going to take some precautionary measures.\u201d I made a shooing motion. \u201cYou two go get some sleep.\u201d\nSim rubbed his forehead, chuckling to himself. \u201cBody of God, you\u2019re irritating sometimes. What if you\u2019re attacked again?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s already happened twice while we\u2019ve been sitting here,\u201d I said easily. \u201cIt tingles a bit.\u201d I grinned at his expression. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Sim. Honestly. There\u2019s a reason I\u2019m the top-ranked duelist in Dal\u2019s class. I\u2019m perfectly safe.\u201d\n\u201cAs long as you\u2019re awake,\u201d Wilem interjected, his dark eyes serious. My grin grew stiff. \u201cAs long as I\u2019m awake,\u201d I repeated. \u201cOf course.\u201d Wilem stood up and made a show of brushing himself off. \u201cSo. Clean\nyourself and take your precautionary measures.\u201d He gave me a pointed look. \u201cShall young master Simmon and I expect Dal\u2019s top-ranked duelist in my room tonight?\u201d\nI felt myself flush with embarrassment. \u201cWhy, yes. That would be greatly appreciated.\u201d\nWil gave me an exaggerated bow, then opened the door and made his way out into the hall.\nSim was wearing a wide grin by now. \u201cIt\u2019s a date then. But put on a shirt before you come. I\u2019ll watch over you tonight like the colicky infant you are, but I refuse to do it if you insist on sleeping naked.\u201d\nAfter Wil and Sim left, I headed out the window and onto the rooftops. I left my shirt in my room, as I was a bloody mess and I didn\u2019t want to ruin it. I trusted the dark night and the lateness of the hour, hoping no one would spot me running along the University rooftops half naked and bloody.\nIt is relatively easy to protect yourself from sympathy if you know what you\u2019re doing. Someone trying to burn or stab me, or draw off my body heat until I lapsed into hypothermia, all those things deal with the simple, direct application of force, so they are easy to oppose. I was safe now that I knew what was happening and kept my defenses up.\nMy new concern was that whoever was attacking me might get discouraged and try something different. Something like dowsing out my location, then resorting to a more mundane type of attack, one I couldn\u2019t stave off with an effort of will.\nMalfeasance is terrifying, but a thug with a sharp knife will kill you ten times quicker if he catches you in a dark alley. And catching someone off their guard is remarkably easy if you can track their every movement using their blood.\n \nSo I headed across the rooftops. My plan was to take a handful of autumn leaves, mark them with my blood, and send them tumbling endlessly around the House of the Wind. It was a trick I\u2019d used before.\nBut as I jumped across a narrow alley, I saw lightning flicker in the clouds and smelled rain in the air. A storm was coming. Not only would the rain mat down the leaves, keeping them from moving around, but it would wash my blood away as well.\nStanding there on the rooftop, feeling like I\u2019d had twelve colors of hell beaten out of me, brought back unsettling echoes of my years in Tarbean. I watched the distant lightning for a moment and tried not to let the feeling overwhelm me. I forced myself to remember I wasn\u2019t the same helpless starving child I\u2019d been back then.\nI heard the faint, drumlike sound as a piece of tin roofing bent behind me. I stiffened, then relaxed as I heard Auri\u2019s voice, \u201cKvothe?\u201d\nI looked to my right and saw her small shape standing a dozen feet away. The clouds were hiding the moon, but I could hear a smile in her voice as she said, \u201cI saw you running across the tops of things.\u201d\nI turned the rest of the way around to face her, glad there wasn\u2019t much light. I didn\u2019t like to think how Auri might react to the sight of me half naked and covered in blood.\n\u201cHello Auri,\u201d I said. \u201cThere\u2019s a storm coming. You shouldn\u2019t be up on the tops of things tonight.\u201d\nShe tilted her head. \u201cYou are,\u201d she said simply.\nI sighed. \u201cI am. But only\u2014\u201d\nA great spider of lightning crawled across the sky, illuminating everything\nfor the space of a long second. Then it was gone, leaving me flash-blind. \u201cAuri?\u201d I called, worried the sight of me had scared her off.\nThere was another flicker of lightning, and I saw her standing closer. She\npointed at me, grinning delightedly. \u201cYou look like an Amyr,\u201d she said. \u201cKvothe is one of the Ciridae.\u201d\nI looked down at myself and with the next lightning flicker I saw what she meant. I had dried blood running down the back of my hands from when I\u2019d been trying to stanch my wounds. It looked like the old tattoos the Amyr had used to mark their highest ranking members.\nI was so surprised by her reference that I forgot the first thing I\u2019d learned about Auri. I forgot to be careful and asked her a question, \u201cAuri, how do you know about the Ciridae?\u201d", "There was no response. The next flicker of lightning showed me nothing but an empty rooftop and an unforgiving sky.", ""], "CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR": ["CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR\nClinks\nISTOOD ON THE ROOFTOPS with the storm flickering overhead, my heart heavy in my chest. I wanted to follow Auri and apologize, but I knew it was hopeless. The wrong sort of questions made her run, and when Auri bolted, she was like a rabbit down a hole. There were a thousand places she could hide in the Underthing. I didn\u2019t have a chance of finding her.\nBesides, I had vital matters to attend to. Even now someone could be dowsing out my location. I simply didn\u2019t have the time.\nIt took me the better part of an hour to make my way across the rooftops. The flickering light of the storm made things harder rather than easier, blinding me for long moments after every flash. Still, I eventually made my limping way to the roof of Mains where I typically met Auri.\nStiffly, I climbed down the apple tree to the enclosed courtyard. I was about to call down through the heavy metal grating that led to the Underthing when I saw a flicker of movement in the shadow of the nearby bushes.\nI peered into the dark, unable to see anything but a vague shape. \u201cAuri?\u201d I asked gently.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like telling,\u201d she said softly, her voice thick with tears. Of all the awful things I\u2019d been part of these last couple days, this was unquestionably the worst of it.\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Auri,\u201d I said. \u201cI won\u2019t ask again. I promise.\u201d\nThere was a tiny sob from the shadows that froze my heart solid and broke off a piece of it.\n\u201cWhat were you doing out on top of things tonight?\u201d I asked. I knew this was a safe question. I\u2019d asked it many times before.\n\u201cI was looking at the lightning,\u201d she said, sniffling. Then, \u201cI saw one that looked like a tree.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was in the lightning?\u201d I asked softly.\n\u201cGalvanic ionization,\u201d she said. Then, after a pause, she added, \u201cAnd river- ice. And the sway a cattail makes.\u201d", "\u201cI wish I\u2019d seen that one,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWhat were you doing on top of things.\u201d She paused and gave a tiny hiccuping laugh. \u201cAll crazy and mostly nekkid?\u201d\nMy heart began to thaw a bit. \u201cI was looking for a place to put my blood,\u201d I said.\n\u201cMost people keep that inside,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s easier.\u201d\n\u201cI want to keep the rest of it inside,\u201d I explained. \u201cBut I\u2019m worried someone might be looking for me.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d she said, as if she understood perfectly. I saw the slightly darker shadow of her move in the darkness, standing up. \u201cYou should come with me to Clinks.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen Clinks,\u201d I said. \u201cHave you taken me there before?\u201d\nThere was a motion that might have been the shaking of a head. \u201cIt\u2019s private.\u201d\nI heard a metallic noise, then a rustle, then I saw a blue-green light well up from the open grate. I climbed down and met her in the tunnel underneath.\nThe light in her hand showed smudges across her face, probably from where she\u2019d been rubbing away her tears. It was the first time I\u2019d ever seen Auri dirty. Her eyes were darker than normal, and her nose was red.\nAuri sniffed and rubbed her blotchy face. \u201cYou,\u201d she said gravely, \u201care a dreadful mess.\u201d\nI looked down at my bloody hands and chest. \u201cI am,\u201d I agreed.\nThen she gave a tiny, brave smile. \u201cI didn\u2019t run so far this time,\u201d she said tilting her chin proudly.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d She gave her head a tiny, firm shake. \u201cYou are my Ciridae, and thus above reproach.\u201d She reached out to touch the center of my bloody chest with a finger. \u201cIvare enim euge.\u201d\nAuri led me through the maze of tunnels that comprised the Underthing. We went farther down, through Vaults, past Cricklet. Then we moved through several twisting hallways and down again, using a stone spiral staircase I\u2019d never seen before.\nI smelled damp stone and heard the low, smooth sound of running water as\n \nwe descended. Every once in a while there was the gritty sound of glass on stone, or the brighter tinkling sound of glass on glass.\nAfter about fifty steps the wide, spiraling staircase disappeared into a vast, roiling pool of black water. I wondered how far the stairs continued below the surface.\nThere wasn\u2019t any smell of rot or foulness. It was fresh water, and I could see ripples as it swirled in the stairwell and spread out into the dark beyond where our lights could reach. I heard the clink of glass again and saw two bottles spinning and bobbing on the surface, moving first one way, then another. One ducked under the surface and didn\u2019t come up again.\nThere was a burlap sack hanging from a brass torch bracket mounted into the wall. Auri reached into the bag and pulled out a heavy stoppered bottle of the sort that might have once held Bredon beer.\nShe handed me the bottle. \u201cThey disappear for an hour. Or a minute. Sometimes for days. Sometimes they don\u2019t come back at all.\u201d She brought another bottle out of the sack. \u201cIt\u2019s best to have at least four going at once. That way, statistically, you should always have two moving around.\u201d\nI nodded, and I pulled a strand of burlap from the tattered sack and daubed it with the blood that covered my hand. I uncorked the bottle and dropped it inside.\n\u201cHair too,\u201d Auri said.\nI pulled a few from my head and threaded them through the bottle\u2019s mouth. Then I drove the cork in hard and set it floating. It rode low in the water, circling erratically.\nAuri handed me another bottle and we repeated the process. When the fourth bottle was swept out into the swirling water, Auri nodded and dusted her hands briskly against each other.\n\u201cThere,\u201d she said with a tone of immense satisfaction. \u201cThat\u2019s good. We\u2019re safe.\u201d\nHours later, washed, bandaged, and considerably less nekkid, I made my way to Wilem\u2019s room in the Mews. That night, and for many to come, Wil and Sim took turns watching over me as I slept, keeping me safe with their Alar. They were the best sort of friends. The sort everyone hopes for but no one\n \ndeserves, least of all me.", ""], "CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE": ["CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE\nWrongful Apprehension\nDESPITE WHAT WIL AND Sim believed, I couldn\u2019t believe Devi was responsible for the malfeasance against me. While I was painfully aware that I knew next to nothing about women, she had always been friendly to me. Even sweet at times.\nTrue, she had a grim reputation. But I knew better than anyone how quickly a handful of rumors could turn into full-blown faerie stories.\nI thought it much more likely that my unknown assailant was simply a bitter student who resented my advancement in the Arcanum. Most students studied for years before they reached Re\u2019lar, and I had managed it in less than three terms. It could even be someone who simply hated the Edema Ruh. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time that had earned me a beating.\nIn some ways, it really didn\u2019t matter who was responsible for the attacks. What I needed was a way to stop them. I couldn\u2019t expect Wil and Sim to watch over me for the rest of my life.\nI needed a more permanent solution. I needed a gram.\nA gram is a clever piece of artificery designed for just this sort of problem. It is a sort of sympathetic armor that prevents anyone from making a binding against your body. I didn\u2019t know how they worked, but I knew they existed. And I knew where to find out how to make one.\nKilvin looked up as I approached his office. I was relieved to see his glasswork was cold and dark.\n\u201cI trust you are well, Re\u2019lar Kvothe?\u201d he asked without getting up from the worktable. He was holding a large hemisphere of glass in one hand and a diamond stylus in the other.\n\u201cI am, Master Kilvin,\u201d I lied.\n \n\u201cHave you been thinking about your next project?\u201d he asked. \u201cHave you been dreaming clever dreams?\u201d\n\u201cI was actually looking for a schema for a gram, Master Kilvin. But I can\u2019t find it in any of the bolt-holes or reference books.\u201d\nKilvin looked at me curiously. \u201cAnd why would you be needing a gram, Re\u2019lar Kvothe? Such a desire does not reflect good faith in your fellow arcanists.\u201d\nUnsure as to whether he was joking or not, I decided to play it straight. \u201cWe\u2019ve been learning about slippage in Adept Sympathy. I was thinking that if a gram works to deny outside affinities . . .\u201d\nKilvin gave a low chuckle. \u201cDal has been throwing fear into you. Good. And you are correct, a gram would help protect against slippage\u2014\u201d His dark Cealdish eyes gave me a serious look. \u201cTo a degree. However, it seems a clever student would simply learn his lessons and avoid slippage through proper care and caution.\u201d\n\u201cI intend to, Master Kilvin,\u201d I said. \u201cStill, a gram strikes me as a useful thing to have.\u201d\n\u201cThere is truth to that,\u201d Kilvin admitted, nodding his shaggy head. \u201cHowever, with repairs and the filling of our autumn orders, we are understaffed.\u201d He waved a hand toward the window that looked out into the workshop. \u201cI cannot spare any workers to make such a thing. And even if I could, there is an issue of cost. They require delicate work, and gold is needed for the inlay.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d prefer to make my own, Master Kilvin.\u201d\nKilvin shook his head. \u201cThere is reason the schema is not in the reference books .You are not far enough along to be making your own. One must be careful when meddling with sygaldry and one\u2019s own blood.\u201d\nI opened my mouth to say something, but he cut me off. \u201cMore important, the sygaldry necessary for such a device is only entrusted to those who have reached the ranks of El\u2019the. The runes for blood and bone have too great a potential for misuse.\u201d\nHis tone let me know there was nothing to be gained by arguing, so I shrugged it off as if I couldn\u2019t care less. \u201cIt\u2019s no matter, Master Kilvin. I have other projects to occupy my time.\u201d\nKilvin gave me a wide smile. \u201cI am sure you do, Re\u2019lar Kvothe. I am waiting with great eagerness to see what you will make for me.\u201d\nA thought struck me. \u201cTo that purpose, Master Kilvin, could I have the use", "of one of the private workrooms? I\u2019d rather not have everyone looking over my shoulder while I\u2019m tinkering.\u201d\nKilvin\u2019s eyebrows went up at this. \u201cNow I am doubly curious.\u201d He set down the hemisphere of glass, got to his feet, and opened a drawer in his desk. \u201cWill one of the first floor workrooms suit you? Or is there a chance of something exploding? I will give you one on the third floor if that is the case. They are colder, but the roof is better suited for that sort of thing.\u201d\nI looked at him for a moment, trying to decide if he was joking. \u201cA first floor room will be fine, Master Kilvin. But I\u2019ll need a small smelter and a little extra room to breathe.\u201d\nKilvin muttered to himself, then brought out a key. \u201cHow much breathing will you be doing? Room twenty-seven is five hundred feet square.\u201d\n\u201cThat should be plenty,\u201d I said. \u201cI also might need permission to get precious metals from Stocks.\u201d\nKilvin chuckled at this, and nodded as he handed me the key. \u201cI will see it is done, Re\u2019lar Kvothe. I look forward to seeing what you will make for me.\u201d\nIt was galling that the schema I needed was restricted. But there are always other ways of finding information, and there are always people who know more than they are supposed to.\nFor example, I didn\u2019t doubt Manet knew how to make a gram. Everyone knew he was an E\u2019lir in title only. But there was no way he would share the information with me against Kilvin\u2019s wishes. The University had been Manet\u2019s home for thirty years, and he was probably the only student who feared expulsion more than me.\nThis meant my options were limited. Other than a lengthy search of the Archives, I couldn\u2019t think of any way to get a schema on my own. So, after several minutes of wracking my brain for a better option, I made my way to the Bale and Barley.\nThe Bale was one of the more disreputable taverns this side of the river. Anker\u2019s wasn\u2019t seedy in the strictest sense, it simply lacked pretension. It was clean without smelling of flowers and inexpensive without being tawdry. People visited Anker\u2019s to eat, drink, listen to music, and occasionally have a friendly fight.\n \nThe Bale was several rungs farther down the ladder. It was grubbier, music was not a priority, and the fights were usually only recreational for one of the people involved.\nMind you, the Bale wasn\u2019t as bad as half the places in Tarbean. But it was the worst you were likely to find this close to the University. So despite being seedy, it had wooden floors and glass in the windows. And if you passed out drunk and woke up missing your purse, you could content yourself with the fact that nobody had knifed you and stolen your boots as well.\nAs it was still early in the day, there were a bare handful of people scattered around the common room. I was glad to see Sleat sitting in the back. I hadn\u2019t actually met him, but I knew who he was. I\u2019d heard stories.\nSleat was one of the rare, indispensable people who have a knack for arranging things. From what I\u2019d heard, he\u2019d been a student on and off for the last ten years.\nHe was talking with a nervous-looking man at the moment, and I knew better than to interrupt. So I bought two mugs of short beer and made a pretense of drinking one while I waited.\nSleat was handsome, dark-haired and dark-eyed. Though he didn\u2019t have the characteristic beard, I expected he was at least half Cealdish. His body language screamed authority. He moved as if he were in control of everything around him.\nWhich wouldn\u2019t have surprised me, actually. He could own the Bale for all I knew. People like Sleat are no strangers to money.\nSleat and the anxious young man finally came to some sort of agreement. Sleat smiled warmly as they shook hands and clapped the man on the shoulder as he walked away.\nI waited for a moment, then made my way over to his table. As I came closer, I noticed there was a stretch of open floor between his table and the others in the common room. It wasn\u2019t much, just enough so eavesdropping would be difficult.\nSleat looked up as I approached.\n\u201cI was wondering if we could talk,\u201d I said.\nHe made an expansive gesture to the empty chair. \u201cThis is a bit of a\nsurprise,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t get a lot of clever folks paying me visits. I get desperate folks.\u201d He\nlooked at the mugs. \u201cAre those both for you?\u201d", "\u201cYou can have either or both.\u201d I nodded at the one on the right. \u201cBut I\u2019ve already had my mouth on that one.\u201d\nHe looked at the mugs warily for a fraction of a second, then gave a wide, white smile and took the drink on the left. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard, you\u2019re not the sort to poison a man.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to know a lot about me,\u201d I said.\nHis shrug was so casual I guessed he\u2019d practiced it. \u201cI know a lot about everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I know more about you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d\nSleat slouched forward, leaning on the table and speaking in a confidential tone. \u201cDo you have any idea how boring your average student is? Half of them are rich tourists who don\u2019t care half a damn for their classes.\u201d He rolled his eyes and gestured as if throwing something over his shoulder. \u201cThe other half are bookish tits who have dreamed of this place so long they can hardly breathe once they\u2019re here. They walk on eggshells, meek as priests. Scared lest the masters cast a disapproving eye in their direction.\u201d\nHe sniffed disdainfully and leaned back in his seat. \u201cSuffice to say you\u2019re a breath of fresh air. Everyone says . . .\u201d He stopped and gave his practiced shrug again. \u201cWell, you know.\u201d\n\u201cActually, I don\u2019t,\u201d I admitted. \u201cWhat do people say?\u201d\nSleat gave me a sharp, beautiful smile. \u201cAh, that\u2019s the problem isn\u2019t it? Everyone knows a man\u2019s reputation except the man himself. For most men this isn\u2019t a bother. But some of us labor over our reputations. I have built mine brick by brick. It is a useful tool.\u201d He gave me a sly look. \u201cI expect you understand what I am talking about.\u201d\nI allowed myself a smile. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do they say about me, then? Tell me and I\u2019ll return the favor.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re good at finding things,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re discreet,\nbut expensive.\u201d\nHe waved his hands, irritated. \u201cVagaries. Details are the bones of the story.\nGive me bones.\u201d\nI thought. \u201cI heard you managed to sell several vials of Regim Ignaul\nNeratum last term. After the fire in Kilvin\u2019s shop, where all of it was supposedly destroyed.\u201d\nSleat nodded, his expression giving away nothing.\n\u201cI heard you arranged to get a message to Veyane\u2019s father in Emlin despite the fact that there was a siege going on.\u201d Another nod. \u201cYou got a young", "prostitute working in Buttons a set of documents proving she was a distant bloodline cousin of the Baronet Gamre, allowing her to marry a certain young gentleman with minimal fuss.\u201d\nSleat smiled. \u201cI was proud of that one.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you were an E\u2019lir,\u201d I continued. \u201cYou were suspended for two terms on charges of Wrongful Apprehension. Two years later, you were fined and suspended again for Misuse of University Equipment in the Crucible. I\u2019ve heard Jamison knows the sort of business you do, but he\u2019s paid to turn a blind eye. I don\u2019t believe the last one, by the way.\u201d\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d he said easily. \u201cNeither do I.\u201d\n\u201cDespite your extensive activities, you\u2019ve only been brought up against the iron law once,\u201d I continued. \u201cTransport of Contraband Substances, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\nSleat rolled his eyes. \u201cYou know the damnedest thing? I was actually innocent of that one. Heffron\u2019s boys paid off a constable to fake some evidence. The charges were withdrawn after only two days.\u201d He scowled. \u201cNot that the masters cared. All they gave a damn about was that I was out there besmirching the University\u2019s good name.\u201d His tone was bitter. \u201cMy tuition tripled after that.\u201d\nI decided to push matters a bit. \u201cSeveral months ago you poisoned a young earl\u2019s daughter with Venitasin and only gave her the antidote after she signed over the largest of the fiefdoms she stood to inherit. Then you staged it to look like she\u2019d lost it playing a game of high-stakes faro.\u201d\nHe raised an eyebrow at this. \u201cDo they say why?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cI assumed she tried to default on her debt to you.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s some truth to that,\u201d he said. \u201cThough it was a bit more\ncomplicated. And it wasn\u2019t Venitasin. That would be extraordinarily reckless.\u201d He looked offended and brushed at his sleeve, plainly irritated. \u201cAnything else?\u201d\nI paused, trying to decide if I wanted to get confirmation about something I\u2019d suspected for some time. \u201cOnly that last term you put Ambrose Jakis in touch with a pair of men who have been known to kill people for money.\u201d\nSleat\u2019s expression remained impassive, his body loose and relaxed. But I could see a slight tension in his shoulders. Very little escapes me when I\u2019m watching closely. \u201cThey say that, do they?\u201d\nI gave a shrug that put his to shame. My shrug was so nonchalant it would make a cat jealous. \u201cI\u2019m a musician. I play three nights a span in a busy", "tavern. I hear all manner of things.\u201d I reached for my mug. \u201cAnd what have you heard of me?\u201d\n\u201cThe same stories everyone else knows, of course. You convinced the masters to admit you to the University though you\u2019re just a pup, no offense. Then two days later you shame Master Hemme in his own classroom and get away bird free.\u201d\n\u201cSave for a whipping.\u201d\n\u201cSave for a whipping,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cDuring which you couldn\u2019t be bothered to cry out or bleed, even a little. I wouldn\u2019t believe that if there weren\u2019t several hundred witnesses.\u201d\n\u201cWe drew a decent crowd,\u201d I said. \u201cIt was good weather for a whipping.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard some overly dramatic folk call you Kvothe the Bloodless because of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThough I\u2019m guessing part of that comes from the fact that you\u2019re Edema Ruh, which means you\u2019re about as far from a blooded noble as a person can be.\u201d\nI smiled. \u201cA bit of both, I expect.\u201d\nHe looked thoughtful. \u201cI\u2019ve heard you and Master Elodin fought in Haven. Vast and terrible magics were unleashed, and in the end he won by throwing you through a stone wall, then off the roof of the building.\u201d\n\u201cDo they say what we fought over?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cAll manner of things,\u201d he said dismissively. \u201cAn insult. A misunderstanding. You tried to steal his magic. He tried to steal your woman. Typical nonsense.\u201d\nSleat rubbed at his face. \u201cLet me see. You play the lute passing well and are proud as a kicked cat. You are unmannerly, sharp-tongued, and show no respect for your betters, which is practically everyone given your lowly ravel birth.\u201d\nI felt a flush of anger start in my face and sweep, hot and prickling, down the entire length of my body. \u201cI am the best musician you will ever meet or see from a distance,\u201d I said with forced calm. \u201cAnd I am Edema Ruh to my bones. That means my blood is red. It means I breathe the free air and walk where my feet take me. I do not cringe and fawn like a dog at a man\u2019s title. That looks like pride to people who have spent their lives cultivating supple spines.\u201d\nSleat gave a lazy smile, and I realized he\u2019d been baiting me. \u201cYou also have a temper, so I\u2019ve heard. And there\u2019s a whole boatload of other assorted nonsense floating around you as well. You only sleep an hour each night.", "You have demon blood. You can talk to the dead\u2014\u201d\nI leaned forward, curious. That wasn\u2019t one of the rumors I\u2019d started.\n\u201cReally ? Do I talk to spirits, or are they claiming I\u2019m digging up bodies?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m assuming spirits,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anyone mention grave\nrobbing.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cAnything else?\u201d\n\u201cOnly that you were cornered in an alley last term by two men who kill\npeople for money. And despite the fact that they had knives and caught you quite unaware, you blinded one and beat the other senseless, calling down fire and lightning like Taborlin the Great.\u201d\nWe looked at each other for a long moment. It was not a comfortable silence. \u201cDid you put Ambrose in touch with them?\u201d I asked at last.\n\u201cThat,\u201d Sleat said frankly, \u201cis not a good question. It implies I discuss private dealings after the fact.\u201d He gave me a flat look, no hint of a smile anywhere near his mouth or eyes. \u201cBesides, would you trust me to answer honestly?\u201d\nI frowned.\n\u201cI can say, however, that because of those stories, nobody is much interested in taking that sort of job again,\u201d Sleat said conversationally. \u201cNot that there is much call for that sort of work around here to begin with. We\u2019re all terribly civilized.\u201d\n\u201cNot that you would know about it, even if it were going on.\u201d\nHis smile came back. \u201cExactly.\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cEnough chatter then. What is it you\u2019re looking for?\u201d\n\u201cI need a schema for a piece of artificing.\u201d\nHe set his elbows on the table. \u201cAnd . . .\u201d\n\u201cIt contains sygaldry Kilvin restricts to those of El\u2019the rank and higher.\u201d Sleat nodded matter-of-factly. \u201cAnd how quickly do you need it? Hours?\nDays?\u201d\nI thought about Wil and Sim staying up nights to watch over me. \u201cSooner\nis better.\u201d\nSleat looked thoughtful, his eyes unfocused. \u201cIt\u2019s going to cost, and there\u2019s\nno guarantee I\u2019ll be able to produce it on an exact schedule.\u201d He focused in on me. \u201cAlso, if you get caught you\u2019ll be charged with Wrongful Apprehension at the very least.\u201d\nI nodded.\n\u201cAnd you know what the penalties are?\u201d", "\u201c\u2018For Wrongful Apprehension of the Arcane not leading to injury of another,\u201d I recited. \u201c\u2018The offending student may be fined no more than twenty talents, whipped no more than ten times, suspended from the Arcanum, or expelled from the University.\u201d\n\u201cThey fined me the full twenty talents and suspended me two terms,\u201d Sleat said grimly. \u201cAnd that was only some Re\u2019lar-level alchemy. It will be worse with you if this is El\u2019the-level stuff.\u201d\n\u201cHow much?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cTo get hold of it in a few days . . .\u201d He looked up at the ceiling for a moment. \u201cThirty talents.\u201d\nI felt the bottom drop out of my stomach, but I kept my face composed. \u201cIs there any room to negotiate that?\u201d\nHe gave his sharp smile again, his teeth were very white. \u201cI also deal in favors,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a thirty talent favor is going to be a big one.\u201d He looked at me thoughtfully. \u201cWe could perhaps work out something along those lines. But I feel obliged to mention that when I call a favor due, it\u2019s due. At that point, there isn\u2019t any negotiation.\u201d\nI nodded calmly to show him I understood. But I felt a cold knot forming in my gut. This was a bad idea. I knew it in my bones.\n\u201cDo you owe anyone else?\u201d Sleat asked. \u201cAnd don\u2019t lie to me or I\u2019ll know.\u201d\n\u201cSix talents,\u201d I said casually. \u201cDue at the end of the term.\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you didn\u2019t manage to get it off some moneylender. Did you go to Heffron?\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cDevi.\u201d\nFor the first time in our conversation Sleat lost his composure, his charming smile fell away entirely. \u201cDevi?\u201d He pulled himself up in his chair, his body suddenly tense. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t think we can come to an arrangement. If you had cash it would be one thing.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cBut no. If Devi already owns a piece of you . . .\u201d\nHis reaction chilled me, then I realized he was just angling for more money. \u201cWhat if I were to borrow money from you so I could settle my debt with her?\u201d\nSleat shook his head, regaining a piece of his shattered nonchalance. \u201cThat is the very definition of poaching,\u201d he said. \u201cDevi has an ongoing interest in you. An investment.\u201d He took a drink and cleared his throat meaningfully. \u201cShe does not look kindly on other folk interfering where she\u2019s staked her", "claim.\u201d\nI raised an eyebrow. \u201cI guess I was taken in by your reputation,\u201d I said.\n\u201cSilly of me, really.\u201d\nHis face creased into a frown. \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d\nI waved my hands dismissively. \u201cPlease, give me credit for being at least\nhalf as clever as you\u2019ve heard,\u201d I said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t get what I want, just admit it. Don\u2019t waste my time by pricing things out of my reach or coming up with elaborate excuses.\u201d\nSleat seemed unsure if he should be offended. \u201cWhat part of this seems elaborate to you?\u201d\n\u201cCome now,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re willing to run against the laws of the University, risk the wrath of the masters, the constables, and the iron law of Atur. But a little slip of a girl makes your knees quivery?\u201d I sniffed and mimicked the gesture he\u2019d made before, pretending to ball something up and throw it away over my shoulder.\nHe looked at me for a moment, then burst out laughing. \u201cYes, that\u2019s exactly the case,\u201d he said, wiping tears of genuine amusement from his eyes. \u201cApparently I was fooled by your reputation too. If you think Devi is a little slip of a girl, you aren\u2019t nearly as clever as I thought.\u201d\nLooking over my shoulder, Sleat nodded at someone I couldn\u2019t see and waved his hand dismissively. \u201cGo on with you,\u201d he said. \u201cI have business to do with rational people who know the true shape of the world. You\u2019re wasting my time.\u201d\nI felt myself prickling with irritation, but forced myself to keep it off my face. \u201cI also need a crossbow,\u201d I said.\nHe shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve already told you. No loans or favors.\u201d \u201cI can offer goods in exchange.\u201d\nHe looked at me skeptically. \u201cWhat sort of crossbow?\u201d\n\u201cAny sort,\u201d I said. \u201cIt needn\u2019t be fancy. It just needs to work.\u201d \u201cEight talents,\u201d he said.\nI gave him a hard look. \u201cDon\u2019t insult me. This is mundane contraband. I\u2019ll bet ten to a penny you can have one in two hours. If you try to gouge me, I\u2019ll just go over the river and get one from Heffron.\u201d\n\u201cGet one from Heffron and you\u2019ll have to carry it back from Imre,\u201d he said. \u201cConstable would love seeing that.\u201d\nI shrugged and began to get to my feet.\n\u201cThree talents and five,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be used, mind you. And a stirrup,", "not a crank.\u201d\nI calculated in my head. \u201cWill you accept an ounce of silver and a spool of\nfinely drawn gold wire?\u201d I asked, bringing them out from the pockets of my cloak.\nSleat\u2019s dark eyes unfocused slightly as he did his own internal calculations. \u201cYou drive a tight bargain.\u201d He picked up the spool of bright wire and the small ingot of silver. \u201cThere\u2019s a rain barrel behind the Grimsome Tannery. The crossbow will be there in fifteen minutes.\u201d He gave me an insulted look. \u201cTwo hours? You don\u2019t know anything about me at all.\u201d\nHours later Fela emerged from the shelves in the Archives and caught me with one hand against the four-plate door. I wasn\u2019t pushing on it, exactly. Just pressing. Just checking to see if it was firmly closed. It was.\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose they tell scrivs what\u2019s behind this?\u201d I asked her without any hope.\n\u201cIf they do, they haven\u2019t told me yet,\u201d Fela said, stepping close and reaching out to run her fingers along the grooves the letters made in the stone: Valaritas . \u201cI had a dream about the door once,\u201d she said. \u201cValaritas was the name of an old dead king. His tomb was behind the door.\u201d\n\u201cWow,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s better than the dreams I have about it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are yours?\u201d She asked.\n\u201cOnce I dreamed I saw light through the keyholes,\u201d I said. \u201cBut mostly I\u2019m\njust standing here, staring at it, trying to get in.\u201d I frowned at the door. \u201cAs if standing outside while I\u2019m awake isn\u2019t frustrating enough, I do it while I\u2019m asleep too.\u201d\nFela laughed softly at that, then turned away from the door to face me. \u201cI got your note,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the research project you were so vague about?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s go somewhere private to talk,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a story.\u201d\nWe made our way to one of the reading holes, and once the door was closed I told her the whole story, embarrassments and all. Someone was practicing malfeasance against me. I couldn\u2019t go to the masters for fear of revealing I was the one who had broken into Ambrose\u2019s rooms. I needed a gram to protect myself, but I didn\u2019t know enough sygaldry to make one.\n \n\u201cMalfeasance,\u201d she said in a low voice, slowly shaking her head in dismay. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d\nI unbuttoned my shirt and took it down off my shoulder, revealing the dark bruise on my shoulder from the attack I\u2019d only managed to partially stop.\nShe leaned in to look at it. \u201cAnd you really don\u2019t know who it might be?\u201d\n\u201cNot really,\u201d I said, trying not to think of Devi. I wanted to keep that particular bad decision to myself for now. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to drag you into this, but you\u2019re the only one . . .\u201d\nFela waved her hands in negation. \u201cNone of that. I told you to ask if you ever needed a favor, and I\u2019m glad you did.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re glad,\u201d I said. \u201cIf you can get me through this, I\u2019ll owe you instead. I\u2019m getting better at finding what I want in here, but I\u2019m still new.\u201d\nFela nodded. \u201cIt takes years to learn your way around the Stacks. It\u2019s like a city.\u201d\nI smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s how I think of it too. I haven\u2019t lived here long enough to learn all the shortcuts.\u201d\nFela grimaced a bit. \u201cAnd I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re going to need those. If Kilvin really believes the sygaldry is dangerous, most of the books you want will be in his private library.\u201d\nI felt a sinking sensation in my stomach. \u201cPrivate library?\u201d\n\u201cAll the masters have private libraries,\u201d Fela said matter-of-factly. \u201cI know some alchemy so I help spot books with formulae Mandrag wouldn\u2019t want in the wrong hands. Scrivs who know sygaldry do the same for Kilvin.\u201d\n\u201cBut this is pointless then,\u201d I said. \u201cIf Kilvin has all those books locked away there\u2019s no chance of finding what I\u2019m looking for.\u201d\nFela smiled, shaking her head. \u201cThe system isn\u2019t perfect. Only about a third of the Archives are properly cataloged. What you\u2019re looking for is probably still in the Stacks somewhere. It\u2019s just a matter of finding it.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t even need a whole schema,\u201d I said. \u201cIf I just knew a few of the proper runes I could probably just fake the rest.\u201d\nShe gave me a worried look. \u201cIs that really wise?\u201d\n\u201cWisdom is a luxury I can\u2019t afford,\u201d I said. \u201cWil and Sim have already been watching over me for two nights. They can\u2019t sleep in shifts for the next ten years.\u201d\nFela drew a deep breath then let it out slowly. \u201cRight. We can start with the cataloged books first. Maybe what you need has slipped past the scrivs.\u201d", "We collected several dozen books on sygaldry and closeted ourselves in an out-of-the-way reading hole on the fourth floor. Then we started going through them one at a time.\nWe began with hopes of finding a full-fledged schema for a gram, but as the hours slid by we lowered our hopes. If not a whole schema, perhaps we could find a description of one. Perhaps a reference to the sequence of runes used. The name of a single rune. A hint. A clue. A scrap. Some piece of the puzzle.\nI closed the last of the books we had brought back to the reading hole. It made a solid thump as the pages settled together.\n\u201cNothing?\u201d she asked tiredly.\n\u201cNothing.\u201d I rubbed my face with both hands. \u201cSo much for getting lucky.\u201d Fela shrugged, grimacing halfway through the motion, then craned her\nhead to one side to stretch a kink out of her neck. \u201cIt made sense to start in the most obvious places,\u201d she said. \u201cBut those will be the same places the scrivs have combed over for Kilvin. We\u2019ll just have to dig deeper.\u201d\nI heard the distant sound of the belling tower and was surprised at how many times it struck. We\u2019d been researching for over four hours. \u201cYou\u2019ve missed your class,\u201d I said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just geometries,\u201d she said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a wonderful person,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat\u2019s our best option now?\u201d \u201cA long, slow trawl of the Stacks,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be like\npanning for gold. Dozens of hours, and that\u2019s with both of us working together so we don\u2019t overlap our efforts.\u201d\n\u201cI can bring in Wil and Sim to help,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWilem works here,\u201d Fela said. \u201cBut Simmon\u2019s never been a scriv, he\u2019ll probably just get in the way.\u201d\nI gave her an odd look. \u201cDo you know Sim very well?\u201d\n\u201cNot very,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him around.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re underestimating him,\u201d I said. \u201cPeople do it all the time. Sim\u2019s\nsmart.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone here is smart,\u201d Fela said. \u201cAnd Sim is nice, but . . .\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the problem,\u201d I said. \u201cHe\u2019s nice. He\u2019s gentle, which people see as\nweak. And he\u2019s happy, which people see as stupid.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that,\u201d Fela said.\n\u201cI know,\u201d I said, rubbing at my face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s been a bad couple of\ndays. I thought the University would be different than the rest of the world,", "but it\u2019s just like everywhere else: people cater to pompous, rude bastards like Ambrose, while the good souls like Simmon get brushed off as simpletons.\u201d\n\u201cWhich one are you?\u201d Fela said with a smile as she began to stack up the books. \u201cPompous bastard or good soul?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll research that later,\u201d I said. \u201cRight now I\u2019ve got more pressing concerns.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX": ["CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX\nTrust\nWHILE I WAS FAIRLY sure Devi wasn\u2019t behind the malfeasance, I\u2019d have to be a fool to ignore the fact that she had my blood. So when it became clear that making a gram was going to require a great deal of time and energy, I realized the time had come to pay her a visit and make sure she wasn\u2019t responsible.\nIt was a miserable day: chill with a clammy wind that cut through my clothes. I didn\u2019t own gloves or a hat, and had to settle for putting up my hood and wrapping my hands in the fabric of my cloak as I pulled it more tightly around my shoulders.\nAs I crossed Stonebridge a new thought occurred to me: maybe someone had stolen my blood from Devi. That made better sense than anything else. I needed to make sure the bottle with my blood was safe. If she still had it, and it hadn\u2019t been tampered with, I\u2019d know she wasn\u2019t involved.\nI made my way to the western edge of Imre where I stopped at a tavern to buy a small beer and warm myself by their fire. Then I walked through the now familiar alley and up the narrow staircase behind the butcher\u2019s shop. Despite the chill and recent rain, the smell of rancid fat still hung in the air.\nI took a deep breath and knocked on the door.\nIt opened after a minute, then Devi\u2019s face peered through a narrow crack in the door. \u201cWell hello,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you here for business or pleasure?\u201d\n\u201cBusiness mostly,\u201d I admitted.\n\u201cPity.\u201d She opened the door wider.\nAs I came into the room I tripped on the threshold, stumbling clumsily into\nher and resting one hand briefly on her shoulder as I steadied myself. \u201cSorry,\u201d I said, embarrassed.\n\u201cYou look like hell,\u201d she said as she bolted the door. \u201cI hope you\u2019re not looking for more money. I don\u2019t lend to folks who look like they\u2019re coming off a three-day drunk.\u201d\nI settled wearily into a chair. \u201cI brought back your book.\u201d I said, bringing it", "out from under my cloak and laying it on her desk.\nShe nodded at it, smiling a bit. \u201cWhat did you think of good old Malcaf?\u201d \u201cDry. Wordy. Boring.\u201d\n\u201cThere weren\u2019t any pictures either,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cBut that\u2019s beside the\npoint.\u201d\n\u201cHis theories about perception as an active force were interesting,\u201d I\nadmitted. \u201cBut he writes like he\u2019s afraid someone might actually understand him.\u201d\nDevi nodded, her mouth pursed. \u201cThat\u2019s about what I thought too.\u201d She reached across the desk and slid the book closer to herself. \u201cWhat did you think about the chapter on proprioception?\u201d\n\u201cHe seemed to be arguing from a deep well of ignorance,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve met people in the Medica with amputated limbs. I don\u2019t think Malcaf ever has.\u201d\nI watched her for some sign of guilt, some indication she\u2019d been practicing malfeasance against me. But there was nothing. She seemed perfectly normal, cheery and sharp-tongued as ever. But I had grown up among actors. I know how many ways there are to hide your true feelings.\nDevi made an exaggerated frown. \u201cYou look so serious over there. What are you thinking?\u201d\n\u201cI had a couple of questions,\u201d I said evasively. I wasn\u2019t looking forward to this. \u201cNot about Malcaf.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m so tired of being appreciated for my intellect.\u201d She leaned back and stretched her arms over her head. \u201cWhen will I be able to find a nice boy who just wants me for my body?\u201d She gave a luxurious stretch, but stopped halfway through, giving me a puzzled look. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for a quip here. You\u2019re usually quicker than this.\u201d\nI gave her a weak smile. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot on my mind. I don\u2019t think I can match wits with you today.\u201d\n\u201cI never suspected you could match wits with me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do like a little banter now and then.\u201d She leaned forward and folded her hands on the top of the desk. \u201cWhat sort of questions?\u201d\n\u201cDid you do much sygaldry in the University?\u201d\n\u201cPersonal questions.\u201d She raised an eyebrow. \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t care for it. Too much fiddling around for my taste.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to be the sort of woman who\u2019d mind a little fiddling around,\u201d I said, managing a weak smile.\n\u201cThat\u2019s more like it,\u201d she said with approval. \u201cI knew you had it in you.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you have any books on advanced sygaldry?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe sort of things they don\u2019t allow a Re\u2019lar access to?\u201d\nDevi shook her head. \u201cNo. I\u2019ve got some nice alchemical texts though. Stuff you\u2019d never find in your precious Archives.\u201d Bitterness was thick in her voice when she said the last word.\nThat\u2019s when it all came together in my head. Devi wouldn\u2019t ever be so careless as to let someone steal my blood. She wouldn\u2019t sell it to turn a quick profit. She didn\u2019t need the money. She didn\u2019t have a grudge against me.\nBut Devi would sell her eyeteeth to get into the Archives.\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny you should mention alchemy,\u201d I said as calmly as possible. \u201cHave you ever heard of something called a plum bob?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of it,\u201d she said easily. \u201cNasty little thing. I think I have the formula.\u201d She turned in her seat a little, facing toward the shelf. \u201cYou interested in seeing it?\u201d\nHer face didn\u2019t betray her, but with enough practice, anyone can control their face. Her body language didn\u2019t give her away either. There was only the slightest tension in her shoulders, only a hint of hesitation.\nIt was her eyes. When I mentioned the plum bob, I saw a flicker there. Not just recognition. Guilt. Of course. She\u2019d sold the formula to Ambrose.\nAnd why wouldn\u2019t she? Ambrose was a high-ranking scriv. He could sneak her into the Archives. Hell, with the resources at his disposal, he might not even have to do that. Everyone knew Lorren occasionally granted nonarcanum scholars access to the Archives, especially if their patrons were willing to pave the way with a generous donation. Ambrose had once bought an entire inn just to spite me. How much more would he be willing to pay to get hold of my blood?\nNo.Wil and Sim had been right about that. Ambrose wasn\u2019t the sort to get his hands dirty if he could avoid it. Much simpler for him to hire Devi to do his dirty work for him. She\u2019d already been expelled. She had nothing to lose and all the secrets of the Archives to gain.\n\u201cNo thanks,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t do much alchemy.\u201d I took a deep breath and decided to jump right to the point. \u201cBut I do need to see my blood.\u201d\nDevi\u2019s cheery expression froze on her face. Her mouth still smiled, but her eyes were cold. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d It wasn\u2019t really a question.\n\u201cI need to see the blood I left here with you,\u201d I said. \u201cI need to know it\u2019s safe.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s not possible.\u201d Her smile fell completely away, and her", "mouth made a thin, flat line. \u201cThat\u2019s not how I do business. Besides, do you think I\u2019d be stupid enough to keep that sort of thing here?\u201d\nI felt a sinking sensation in my gut, still not wanting to believe it. \u201cWe can go to wherever you keep it,\u201d I said calmly. \u201cSomeone has been conducting malfeasance against me. I need to make sure it hasn\u2019t been tampered with. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cAs if I would just show you where I keep that sort of thing,\u201d Devi said with scathing sarcasm. \u201cHave you been struck in the head or something?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I must insist.\u201d\n\u201cGo ahead and be afraid,\u201d Devi said with a glare. \u201cGo ahead and insist. It won\u2019t make any difference.\u201d\nIt was her. There was no other reason for her to keep it from me. \u201cIf you refuse to show me,\u201d I continued, trying to keep my voice level and calm. \u201cI must assume you\u2019ve sold my blood, or made your own mommet of me for some reason.\u201d\nDevi leaned back in her chair and crossed her arms with deliberate nonchalance. \u201cYou can assume whatever stupid thing pleases you.You\u2019ll see your blood when you settle your debt with me, and not one moment sooner.\u201d\nI brought out a wax doll from underneath my cloak and rested my hand on the desk so she could see it.\n\u201cIs that supposed to be me?\u201d she said. \u201cWith hips like that?\u201d But the words were just the shell of a joke, a reflex action. Her tone was flat and angry. Her eyes were hard.\nWith my other hand I brought out a short strawberry-blond hair and fixed it to the doll\u2019s head. Devi\u2019s hand went unconsciously to her own hair, her expression shocked.\n\u201cSomeone has been attacking me,\u201d I said. \u201cI need to make sure my blood is \u2014\u201d\nThis time when I mentioned my blood, I saw her eyes flicker to one of her desk\u2019s drawers. Her fingers twitched slightly.\nI met her eye. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said grimly.\nDevi\u2019s hand darted to the drawer, yanking it open.\nI didn\u2019t doubt for a second that the drawer held the mommet she\u2019d made of\nme. I couldn\u2019t let her get hold of it. I concentrated and murmured a binding. Devi\u2019s hand came to a jarring halt halfway to the open drawer.\nI hadn\u2019t done anything to hurt her. No fire, no pain, nothing like what\nshe\u2019d done to me over the last several days. It was just a binding to keep her", "motionless. When I\u2019d stopped at the tavern to warm myself, I\u2019d taken a pinch of ash from their fireplace. It wasn\u2019t a great source, and it was farther away than I\u2019d like, but it was better than nothing.\nStill, I could probably only hold her like this for a few minutes before I drew so much heat from the fire that I extinguished it. But that should be enough time for me to get the truth out of her and reclaim the mommet she\u2019d made.\nDevi\u2019s eyes grew wild as she struggled to move. \u201cHow dare you!\u201d she shouted. \u201cHow dare you!\u201d\n\u201cHow dare you!\u201d I spat back angrily. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I trusted you! I defended you to my friends\u2014\u201d I trailed off as the unthinkable happened. Despite my binding, Devi started to move, her hand inching its way into the open drawer.\nI concentrated harder and Devi\u2019s hand came to a halt. Then, slowly, it began to creep forward again, disappearing into the drawer. I couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\u201cYou think you can come in here and threaten me?\u201d Devi hissed, her face a mask of rage. \u201cYou think I can\u2019t take care of myself? I made Re\u2019lar before they threw me out, you little slipstick. I earned it. My Alar is like the ocean in storm.\u201d Her hand was almost completely inside the drawer now.\nI felt a clammy sweat break out across my forehead and broke my mind three more times. I murmured again and each piece of my mind made a separate binding, focusing on keeping her still. I drew heat from my body, feeling the cold crawl up my arms as I bore down on her. That was five bindings in all. My outside limit.\nDevi went motionless as stone, and she chuckled deep in her throat, grinning. \u201cOh you\u2019re very good. I almost believe the stories about you now. But what makes you think you can do what even Elxa Dal couldn\u2019t? Why do you think they expelled me? They feared a woman who could match a master by her second year.\u201d Sweat made her pale hair cling to her forehead. She clenched her teeth, her pixie face savage with determination. Her hand began to move again.\nThen, with a sudden burst of motion she yanked her hand out of the drawer as if pulling it free from thick mud. She slammed something round and metallic down on the top of the desk, making the lamp\u2019s flame leap and stutter. It wasn\u2019t a mommet. It wasn\u2019t a bottle of my blood.\n\u201cYou bastard,\u201d she said, almost chanting the words. \u201cYou think I\u2019m not", "ready for this sort of thing? You think you\u2019re the first to try and take advantage of me?\u201d She twisted the top of the grey metal sphere. It gave a distinct click and she drew her hand slowly away. Despite my best efforts, I couldn\u2019t keep her still.\nThat\u2019s when I recognized the device she\u2019d brought out of the drawer. I\u2019d studied them with Manet last term. Kilvin referred to them as \u201cself-contained exothermic accelerators,\u201d but everyone else called them pocket warmers or poor-boys.\nThey held kerosene, or naphtha, or sugar. Once activated, a poor-boy burned the fuel inside, pouring out as much heat as a forge fire for about five minutes. Then it needed to be dismantled, cleaned, and refilled. They were messy and dangerous and tended to break easily because of the rapid heating and cooling. But for a short time, they gave a sympathist a bonfire\u2019s worth of energy.\nI lowered myself into the Heart of Stone and splintered off another piece of my mind, murmuring the binding. Then I tried for a seventh and failed. I was tired, and I hurt. The cold was leeching up my arms, and I had been through so much in the last few days. But I clenched my teeth and forced myself to murmur the words under my breath.\nDevi didn\u2019t even seem to notice the sixth binding. Moving as slowly as the hand of a clock, she pulled a loose thread free from her sleeve. The poor-boy made a groaning, metallic creak and heat began to roll off it in shimmering waves.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a decent link to you right now,\u201d Devi said, as the hand holding the thread moved slowly back toward the poor-boy. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t loose your binding, I\u2019ll use this to burn every scrap of clothing off your body, and smile while you scream.\u201d\nIt\u2019s strange what thoughts flash into your head in these situations. The first thing I thought of wasn\u2019t being horribly burned. It was that the cloak Fela had given me would be ruined, and I\u2019d be left with only two shirts.\nMy eyes darted to the top of Devi\u2019s desk where the varnish was already starting to blister in a ring around the poor-boy. I could feel the heat radiating against my face.\nI know when I\u2019m beaten. I broke the bindings, my mind reeling as the pieces slid back together.\nDevi rolled her shoulders. \u201cLet go of it,\u201d she said.\nI opened my hand and the wax doll toppled drunkenly onto the desk. I sat", "with my hands in my lap and remained very still, not wanting to startle or threaten her in any way.\nDevi stood up and leaned across the desk. She reached out and ran a hand through my hair, then made a fist, tearing some away. I yelped despite myself.\nSitting back down, Devi picked up the doll and replaced her hair with several of my own. She muttered a binding.\n\u201cDevi, you don\u2019t understand,\u201d I said. \u201cI just needed to\u2014\u201d\nWhen I had bound Devi, I had focused on her arms and legs. It\u2019s the most efficient way to restrain someone. I\u2019d had limited heat to work with and couldn\u2019t waste energy on anything else.\nBut Devi had heat to spare right now, and her binding was like being shut in an iron vise. I couldn\u2019t move my arms or legs, or jaw, or tongue. I could barely breathe, only taking tiny, shallow breaths that didn\u2019t require any movement of my chest. It was horrifying, like having someone\u2019s hand around my heart.\n\u201cI trusted you.\u201d Devi\u2019s voice was low and rough, like a fine-toothed surgeon\u2019s saw cutting away an amputated leg. \u201cI trusted you.\u201d She gave me a look that was pure fury and loathing. \u201cI actually had someone come here, looking to buy your blood. Fifty-five talents. I turned him away. I denied even knowing you because you and I had a business relationship. I stick to the bargains I make.\u201d\nWho? I wanted to shout. But I could only make an inarticulate huuu huuu sound.\nDevi looked at the wax doll she held, then at the poor-boy charring a dark ring into the top of her desk. \u201cOur business relationship is now over,\u201d she said tightly. \u201cI am calling your debt due. You have until the end of the term to get me my money. Nine talents. If you are one half-breath late, I will sell your blood to recover my investment and wash my hands of you.\u201d\nShe eyed me coldly. \u201cThis is better than you deserve. I still have your blood. If you go to the masters at the University or the constable in Imre, it will end badly for you.\u201d\nSmoke was curling up from the desk now, and Devi moved her hand to hold the mommet over the creaking metal of the poor-boy. She murmured, and I felt a prickle of heat wash over my whole body. It felt exactly like the sudden fevers that had been plaguing me for days.\n\u201cWhen I release this binding, you will say, \u2018I understand, Devi.\u2019 Then you", "will leave. At the end of the term, you will send someone with the money you owe. You will not come yourself. I do not ever want to see you again.\u201d\nDevi looked at me with such contempt that I cringe to remember it. Then she spat on me, tiny flecks of saliva striking the poor-boy and hissing into steam. \u201cIf I glimpse you again, even out of the corner of my eye, it will end badly for you.\u201d\nShe lifted the wax mommet over her head, then brought it down sharply on the desk with her hand flat on top of it. If I\u2019d been able to flinch or cry out in panic, I would have.\nThe mommet shattered, arms and legs breaking away, the head skittering off to roll across the desk and onto the floor. I felt a sudden, jarring impact, as if I\u2019d fallen several feet and landed flat on a stone floor. It was startling, but nowhere near as bad as it could have been. Through the terror, some small part of me marveled at her precision and control.\nThe binding that held me fell away, and I drew a deep breath. \u201cI understand, Devi,\u201d I said. \u201cBut can\u2014\u201d\n\u201cGet OUT!\u201d she shouted.\nI got out. I would like to say it was a dignified exit, but that would not be the truth.", ""], "CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN": ["CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN\nPressure\nWIL AND SIM WERE waiting for me in the back corner of Anker\u2019s. I brought over two mugs of beer and a tray laden with fresh bread and butter, cheese and fruit, and bowls of hot soup, thick with beef and turnip.\nWilem rubbed one eye with the palm of his hand. He looked a little peaked under his dark Cealdish complexion, but other than that he didn\u2019t seem much the worse for three nights of short sleep. \u201cWhat\u2019s the occasion?\u201d\n\u201cI just want to help you two keep your energy up,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWay ahead of you,\u201d Sim said. \u201cI had a refreshing nap during my sublimation lecture.\u201d His eyes were a little dark around the edges, but he didn\u2019t seem much the worse for wear either.\nWilem began to load up his plate. \u201cYou mentioned you had news. What sort of news?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s mixed,\u201d I said. \u201cWhich do you want first, good or bad?\u201d\n\u201cBad news first,\u201d Simmon said.\n\u201cKilvin won\u2019t give me the plans I need to make my own gram. It\u2019s the\nsygaldry involved. Runes for blood and bone and such. He feels they\u2019re too dangerous to be taught to Re\u2019lar.\u201d\nSimmon looked curious. \u201cDid he say why?\u201d\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut I can guess. I could use them to make all manner of unpleasant things. Like a little metal disk with a hole in it. Then, if you put a drop of someone\u2019s blood in it, you could use it to burn them alive.\u201d\n\u201cGod, that\u2019s awful,\u201d Sim said, setting down his spoon. \u201cDo you ever have any nice thoughts?\u201d\n\u201cAnyone in the Arcanum could do the same thing with basic sympathy,\u201d Wilem pointed out.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big difference,\u201d I said. \u201cOnce I made that device, anyone could use it. Again and again.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s insane,\u201d Simmon said. \u201cWhy would anyone make anything like that?\u201d", "\u201cMoney,\u201d Wilem said grimly. \u201cPeople do stupid things for money all the time.\u201d He gave me a significant look. \u201cSuch as borrowing from bloodthirsty gattesors.\u201d\n\u201cWhich brings me to my second piece of news,\u201d I said uncomfortably. \u201cI confronted Devi.\u201d\n\u201cAlone?\u201d Simmon said. \u201cAre you stupid?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cBut not for the reasons you think. Things got unpleasant, but now I know she wasn\u2019t responsible for the attacks.\u201d\nWilem frowned. \u201cIf not her, then who?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one thing that makes sense,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s Ambrose.\u201d\nWil shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019ve already gone through this. Ambrose would\nnever risk it. He\u2014\u201d\nI held up a hand to stop him. \u201cHe\u2019d never risk malfeasance against me,\u201d I\nagreed. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he knows who he\u2019s attacking.\u201d\nWilem closed his mouth and looked thoughtful.\nI continued. \u201cThink about it. If Ambrose suspected it was me, he\u2019d bring\nme up on charges in front of the masters. He\u2019s done it before.\u201d I rubbed my wounded arm. \u201cThey\u2019d discover my injuries and I\u2019d be caught.\u201d\nWil looked down at the tabletop. \u201cKraem,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes sense. He might suspect you of hiring a thief, but not that you\u2019d break in yourself. He\u2019d never do something like that.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s probably trying to find the person who broke into his rooms. Or just get a little easy revenge. That explains why the attacks have been getting stronger. He probably thinks the thief ran off to Imre or Tarbean.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to go to the masters with this,\u201d Simmon said. \u201cThey can search his rooms tonight. He\u2019ll be expelled for this, and whipped.\u201d A wide, vicious grin spread over his face. \u201cGod, I\u2019d pay ten talents if I got to hold the lash.\u201d\nI chuckled at his bloodthirsty tone. It took a lot to get on Sim\u2019s bad side, but once you made it there was no going back. \u201cWe can\u2019t, Sim.\u201d\nSim gave me a look of sheer disbelief. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious. He can\u2019t get away with this.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d get expelled for breaking into his rooms in the first place. Conduct Unbecoming.\u201d\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t expel you for that,\u201d Sim said, but his voice was far from certain.\n\u201cI\u2019m not willing to take the risk,\u201d I said. \u201cHemme hates me. Brandeur", "follows Hemme\u2019s lead. I\u2019m still in Lorren\u2019s bad books.\u201d\n\u201cAnd somehow he still finds the strength to pun,\u201d Wilem muttered. \u201cThat\u2019s three votes against me right there.\u201d\n\u201cI think you don\u2019t give Lorren enough credit,\u201d Wilem said. \u201cBut you\u2019re\nright. They\u2019d expel you. If for no other reason, they\u2019d do it to smooth things over with Baron Jakis.\u201d\nSim looked at Wilem. \u201cYou really think so?\u201d\nWil nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s possible they wouldn\u2019t even expel Ambrose,\u201d he said grimly. \u201cHe\u2019s Hemme\u2019s favorite, and the masters know the trouble his father could make for the University.\u201d Wil snorted. \u201cThink of the trouble Ambrose could make when he inherits.\u201d Wilem lowered his eyes and shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m with Kvothe on this one, Sim.\u201d\nSimmon gave a great, weary sigh. \u201cWonderful,\u201d he said. Then he looked up at me with narrow eyes. \u201cI told you,\u201d he said. \u201cI told you to leave Ambrose alone from the very beginning. Getting into a fight with him is like stepping into a bear trap.\u201d\n\u201cA bear trap?\u201d I said thoughtfully.\nHe nodded firmly. \u201cYour foot goes in easy enough, but you\u2019re never getting it out again.\u201d\n\u201cA bear trap,\u201d I repeated. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I need.\u201d\nWilem chuckled darkly.\n\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d I said. \u201cWhere can I get a bear trap?\u201d\nWil and Sim looked at me strangely, and I decided not to push my luck.\n\u201cJust a joke,\u201d I lied, not wanting to complicate things any further. I could find one on my own.\n\u201cWe need to be sure it\u2019s Ambrose,\u201d Wilem said.\nI nodded. \u201cIf he\u2019s locked away in his rooms the next few times I\u2019m attacked, that should be evidence enough.\u201d\nThe conversation lapsed a bit, and for a couple of minutes we ate quietly, each of us tangled in our own thoughts.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Simmon said, seeming to have reached some conclusion. \u201cNothing\u2019s really changed. You still need a gram. Right?\u201d He looked at Wil, who nodded, then back to me. \u201cNow hurry up with the good news before I kill myself.\u201d\nI smiled. \u201cFela has agreed to help me search the Archives for the schema.\u201d I gestured toward the two of them. \u201cIf the two of you care to join us, it will mean long, grueling hours in close contact with the most beautiful woman", "this side of the Omethi River.\u201d\n\u201cI might be able to spare some time,\u201d Wilem said casually. Simmon grinned.\nThus began our search of the Archives.\nSurprisingly, it was fun at first, almost like a game. The four of us would\nscatter to different sections of the Archives then return and comb through the books as a group. We spent hours chatting and joking, enjoying the challenge and one another\u2019s company.\nBut as hours turned into days of fruitless searching, the excitement burned away, leaving only a grim determination. Wil and Sim continued to watch over me at night, protecting me with their Alar. Night after night they lost sleep, making them sullen and irritable. I cut my sleep down to five hours a night to make things easier for them.\nUnder ordinary circumstances, five hours of sleep would be a great plenty for me, but I was still recovering from my injuries. What\u2019s more, I needed to constantly maintain the Alar that kept me safe. It was mentally exhausting.\nOn the third day of our search I nodded off while studying my metallurgy. I only dozed for half a minute before my head lolled, startling me awake. But the icy fear followed me for the rest of the day. If Ambrose had attacked at that moment, I could have been killed.\nSo, even though I couldn\u2019t afford it, I began dipping into my thinning purse to buy coffee. Many of the inns and cafes near the University catered to noble tastes, so it was readily available, but coffee is never cheap. Nahlrout would have been less expensive, but it had harsher side effects that I didn\u2019t want to risk.\nIn between bouts of research, we set about confirming my suspicions that Ambrose was responsible for the attacks. In this, if nothing else, we were lucky. Wil watched Ambrose return to his room after his rhetoric lecture, and at the same time I was forced to stave off binder\u2019s chills. Fela watched him finish a late lunch and return to his rooms, and a quarter hour later I felt a sweaty prickle of heat along my back and arms.\nLater that evening I watched him head back to his rooms in the Golden Pony after his shift in the Archives. Not long after, I felt the faint pressure in\n \nboth my shoulders that let me know he was trying to stab me. After the shoulders, there followed several other prods in a more personal area.\nWil and Sim agreed that it couldn\u2019t be coincidence: it was Ambrose. Best of all, it let us know that whatever Ambrose was using against me, he kept it in his rooms.", ""], "CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT": ["CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT\nKindling\nTHE ATTACKS WEREN\u2019T PARTICULARLY frequent, but they came with no warning.\nOn the fifth day after we started searching for the schema, when Ambrose must have been feeling particularly cussed or bored, there were eight of them: one as I was waking up in Wilem\u2019s room, two during lunch, two while I was studying physiognomy in the Medica, then three in quick succession while I was coldsmithing iron in the Fishery.\nThe next day there were no attacks at all. In some ways that was worse. Nothing but hours of waiting for the other shoe to drop.\nSo I learned to maintain an iron-hard Alar as I ate and bathed, as I attended class and had conversations with my teachers and friends. I even maintained it while dueling in Adept Sympathy. On the seventh day of our search, this distraction and my general exhaustion led to my first defeat at the hands of two of my classmates, ending my perfect string of undefeated duels.\nI could say that I was too weary to care, but that wouldn\u2019t be entirely true.\nOn the ninth day of our search Wilem, Simmon, and I were combing through books in our reading hole when the door opened and Fela slipped inside. She was carrying a single book instead of her usual armload. She was breathing heavily.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got it,\u201d she said, her eyes bright. Her voice so excited it was almost fierce. \u201cI found a copy.\u201d She thrust the book out at us so we could read the gold leaf on the thick leather spine: Facci-Moen ve Scrivani.\nWe had learned about the Scrivani early in our search. It was an extensive collection of schemata by a long-dead Artificer named Surthur. Twelve thick volumes of detailed diagrams and descriptions. When we found the index, we\n \nhad thought our search was nearly finished, as it listed \u201cDiagrames Detaling the Construction of a Marvelous Five-Gramme, proven most Effectatious in the Preventing of Maleficent Sympathe.\u201d Location: volume nine, page eighty- two.\nWe tracked down eight versions of the Scrivani in the Archives, but we never found the whole set. Volumes seven, nine, and eleven were always missing, no doubt tucked away in Kilvin\u2019s private library.\nWe\u2019d spent two entire days searching before finally giving up on the Scrivani . But now Fela had found it, not just a piece to the puzzle, but the whole thing.\n\u201cIs it the right one?\u201d Simmon asked, his voice a mixture of excitement and disbelief.\nFela slowly removed her hand from the lower binding, revealing in bright gold: 9.\nI scrambled up out of my chair, almost knocking it over in my rush to get to her. But she smiled and held the book high over her head. \u201cFirst you have to promise me dinner,\u201d she said.\nI laughed and reached for the book. \u201cOnce this is over, I\u2019ll take everyone to dinner.\u201d\nShe sighed. \u201cAnd you have to tell me I\u2019m the best scriv ever.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the best scriv ever,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re twice as good as Wil could ever be, even if he had a dozen hands and a hundred extra eyes.\u201d\n\u201cIck.\u201d She handed me the book. \u201cHere you go.\u201d\nI hurried to the table and cracked the book open.\n\u201cThe pages will be missing, or something like that,\u201d Simmon said in a low\nvoice to Wil. \u201cIt can\u2019t be this easy after all this time. I know something\u2019s going to spike our wheel.\u201d\nI stopped turning pages and rubbed my eyes. I squinted at the writing.\n\u201cI knew it,\u201d Sim said, he leaned his chair back on two legs, covering his tired eyes with his hands. \u201cLet me guess, it\u2019s got the grey rot. Or bookworm, or both.\u201d\nFela stepped close and looked over my shoulder.\u201cOh no!\u201d she said mournfully. \u201cI didn\u2019t even look. I was so excited.\u201d She looked up at us. \u201cDo any of you read Eld Vintic?\u201d\n\u201cI read the chittering gibberish you people call Aturan,\u201d Wilem said sourly. \u201cI consider myself sufficiently multilingual.\u201d\n\u201cOnly a smattering,\u201d I said. \u201cA few dozen words.\u201d", "\u201cI can,\u201d Sim said.\n\u201cReally?\u201d I felt hope rising in my chest again. \u201cWhen did you pick that up?\u201d\nSim scooted his chair across the floor until he could look at the book. \u201cMy first term as an E\u2019lir I heard some Eld Vintic poetry. I studied it for three terms with the Chancellor.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never cared for poetry,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYour loss,\u201d Sim said absently as he turned a few pages. \u201cEld Vintic poetry is thunderous. It pounds at you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the meter like?\u201d I asked, curious despite myself.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about meter,\u201d Simmon said distractedly as he ran a finger down the page in front of him. \u201cIt\u2019s like this:\nSought we the Scrivani word-work of Surthur Long-lost in ledger all hope forgotten.\nYet fast-found for friendship fair the book-bringer Hot comes the huntress Fela, flushed with finding Breathless her breast her high blood rising\nTo ripen the red-cheek rouge-bloom of beauty.\n\u201cThat sort of thing,\u201d Simmon said absently, his eyes still scanning the pages in front of him.\nI saw Fela turn her head to look at Simmon, almost as if she were surprised to see him sitting there.\nNo, it was almost as if up until that point, he\u2019d just been occupying space around her, like a piece of furniture. But this time when she looked at him, she took all of him in. His sandy hair, the line of his jaw, the span of his shoulders beneath his shirt. This time when she looked, she actually saw him.\nLet me say this. It was worth the whole awful, irritating time spent searching the Archives just to watch that moment happen. It was worth blood and the fear of death to see her fall in love with him. Just a little. Just the first faint breath of love, so light she probably didn\u2019t notice it herself. It wasn\u2019t dramatic, like some bolt of lightning with a crack of thunder following. It was more like when flint strikes steel and the spark fades almost too fast for you to see. But still, you know it\u2019s there, down where you can\u2019t see, kindling.\n\u201cWho read you Eld Vintic poetry?\u201d Wil asked. Fela blinked and turned back to the book.", "\u201cPuppet,\u201d Sim said. \u201cThe first time I met him.\u201d\n\u201cPuppet!\u201d Wil looked as if he would tear out his own hair. \u201cGod pound me, why haven\u2019t we gone to him about this? If there\u2019s an Aturan translation of this book he\u2019ll know where it is!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought the same thing a hundred times these last few days,\u201d Simmon said. \u201cBut he hasn\u2019t been doing well lately. He wouldn\u2019t be much help.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Puppet knows what\u2019s on the restricted list,\u201d Fela said. \u201cI doubt he\u2019d just hand something like that over.\u201d\n\u201cDoes everyone know this Puppet person except for me?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cScrivs do,\u201d Wilem said.\n\u201cI think I can piece most of this together,\u201d Simmon said, turning to look in\nmy direction. \u201cDoes this diagram make any sense to you? It\u2019s perfect nonsense to me.\u201d\n\u201cThose are the runes.\u201d I pointed. \u201cClear as day. And those are metallurgical symbols.\u201d I looked closer. \u201cThe rest . . . I don\u2019t know. Maybe abbreviations. We can probably work them out as we go along.\u201d\nI smiled and turned to Fela. \u201cCongratulations, you\u2019re still the best scriv ever.\u201d\nWith Simmon\u2019s help, it took me two days to decipher the diagrams in the Scrivani. Rather, it took us one day to decipher and one day to double and triple check our work.\nOnce I knew how to construct my gram, I began to play a strange sort of hide-and-seek with Ambrose. I needed the entirety of my concentration free while I worked on the sygaldry for the gram. That meant letting my guard down. So I could only work on the gram when I was certain Ambrose was otherwise occupied.\nThe gram was delicate work, small engraving with no margin for error. And it didn\u2019t help that I was forced to steal the time in bits and pieces. Half an hour while Ambrose was drinking coffee with a young woman in a public caf\u00e9. Forty minutes when he was attending a symbolic logic lecture. A full hour and a half while he was working at the front desk in the Archives.\nWhen I couldn\u2019t work on my gram, I labored on my pet project. In some ways I was fortunate Kilvin had charged me with making something worthy\n \nof a Re\u2019lar. It gave me the perfect excuse for all the time I spent in the Fishery.\nThe rest of the time I spent lounging in the common room of the Golden Pony. I needed to establish myself as a regular customer there. Things would seem less suspicious that way.", ""], "CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE": ["CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE\nStolen\nEVERY NIGHT I RETIRED to my tiny garret room in Anker\u2019s. Then I would lock the door, climb out the window, and slip into either Wil or Sim\u2019s room, depending on who was keeping first watch over me that night.\nBad as things were, I knew they would become infinitely worse if Ambrose realized I was the one who had broken into his rooms. While my injuries were healing, they were still more than enough to incriminate me. So I worked hard to keep up the appearance of normality.\nThus it was that late one night, I trudged into Anker\u2019s with all the nimble vigor of a shamble-man. I made a weak attempt at small talk with Anker\u2019s new serving girl, then grabbed half a loaf of bread before disappearing up the stairs.\nA minute later I was back in the taproom. I was covered in a panicked sweat, my heart was thundering in my ears.\nThe girl looked up. \u201cYou change your mind about that drink then?\u201d she smiled.\nI shook my head so quickly my hair whipped around my face. \u201cDid I leave my lute down here last night after I finished playing?\u201d I asked frantically.\nShe shook her head. \u201cYou carried it off, same as always. Remember I asked if you needed a bit of string to hold the case together?\u201d\nI darted back up the steps, quick as a fish. Then was back again in less than a minute. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d I asked, breathing hard. \u201cCould you look behind the bar, just to be sure?\u201d\nShe looked, but the lute wasn\u2019t there. It wasn\u2019t in the pantry either. Or the kitchen.\nI climbed the stairs and opened the door to my tiny room. There weren\u2019t many places a lute case could fit in a room that size. It wasn\u2019t under the bed. It wasn\u2019t leaning on the wall next to my small desk. It wasn\u2019t behind the door.\nThe lute case was too large to fit in the old trunk by the foot of the bed. But", "I looked anyway. It wasn\u2019t in the trunk. I looked under the bed again, just to be sure. It wasn\u2019t under the bed.\nThen I looked at the window. At the simple latch I kept well-oiled so I could trip it while standing on the roof outside.\nI looked behind the door again. The lute wasn\u2019t behind the door. Then I sat on the bed. If I had been weary before, then I was something else entirely now. I felt like I was made of wet paper. I felt like I could barely breathe, like someone had stolen my heart out of my chest.", ""], "CHAPTER THIRTY": ["CHAPTER THIRTY\nMore Than Salt\n\u201cTODAY,\u201d ELODIN SAID BRIGHTLY, \u201cwe will talk about things that cannot be talked about. Specifically, we will discuss why some things cannot be discussed.\u201d\nI sighed and set down my pencil. Every day I hoped this class would be the one where Elodin actually taught us something. Every day I brought a hardback and one of my few precious pieces of paper, ready to take advantage of the moment of clarity. Every day some part of me expected Elodin to laugh and admit he\u2019d just been testing our resolve with his endless nonsense.\nAnd every day I was disappointed.\n\u201cThe majority of important things cannot be said outright,\u201d Elodin said. \u201cThey cannot be made explicit. They can only be implied.\u201d He looked out at his handful of students in the otherwise empty lecture hall. \u201cName something that cannot be explained.\u201d He pointed at Uresh. \u201cGo.\u201d\nUresh considered for a moment. \u201cHumor. If you explain a joke, it isn\u2019t a joke.\u201d\nElodin nodded, then pointed at Fenton.\n\u201cNaming?\u201d Fenton asked.\n\u201cThat is a cheap answer, Re\u2019lar,\u201d Elodin said with a hint of reproach. \u201cBut\nyou correctly anticipate the theme of my lecture, so we will let it slide.\u201d He pointed at me.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t anything that can\u2019t be explained,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cIf something can be understood, it can be explained. A person might not be able to do a good job of explaining it. But that just means it\u2019s hard, not that it\u2019s impossible.\u201d\nElodin held up a finger. \u201cNot hard or impossible. Merely pointless. Some things can only be inferred.\u201d He gave me an infuriating smile. \u201cBy the way, your answer should have been \u2018music.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cMusic explains itself,\u201d I said. \u201cIt is the road, and it is the map that shows", "the road. It is both together.\u201d\n\u201cBut can you explain how music works?\u201d Elodin asked.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said. Though I wasn\u2019t sure of any such thing.\n\u201cCan you explain how music works without using music?\u201d\nThat brought me up short. While I was trying to think of a response, Elodin\nturned to Fela.\n\u201cLove?\u201d she asked.\nElodin raised an eyebrow as if mildly scandalized by this, then nodded\napprovingly.\n\u201cHold on a moment,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019re not done. I don\u2019t know if I could\nexplain music without using it, but that\u2019s beside the point. That\u2019s not explanation, it\u2019s translation.\u201d\nElodin\u2019s face lit up. \u201cThat\u2019s it exactly!\u201d he said. \u201cTranslation. All explicit knowledge is translated knowledge, and all translation is imperfect.\u201d\n\u201cSo all explicit knowledge is imperfect?\u201d I asked. \u201cTell Master Brandeur geometry is subjective. I\u2019d love to watch that discussion.\u201d\n\u201cNot all knowledge,\u201d Elodin admitted. \u201cBut most.\u201d\n\u201cProve it,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t prove nonexistence,\u201d Uresh interjected in a matter-of-fact way.\nHe sounded exasperated. \u201cFlawed logic.\u201d\nI ground my teeth at that. It was flawed logic. I never would have made\nthat mistake if I\u2019d been better rested. \u201cDemonstrate it then,\u201d I said. \u201cFine, fine.\u201d Elodin walked over to where Fela sat. \u201cWe\u2019ll use Fela\u2019s example.\u201d He took her hand and pulled her to her feet, motioning me to\nfollow.\nI came reluctantly to my feet as well and Elodin arranged the two of us so\nwe stood facing each other in profile to the class. \u201cHere we have two lovely young people,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir eyes meet across the room.\u201d\nElodin pushed my shoulder and I stumbled forward half a step. \u201cHe says hello. She says hello. She smiles. He shifts uneasily from foot to foot.\u201d I stopped doing just that and there was a faint murmur of laughter from the others.\n\u201cThere is something ephemeral in the air,\u201d Elodin said, moving to stand behind Fela. He put his hands on her shoulders, leaning close to her ear. \u201cShe loves the lines of him,\u201d he said softly. \u201cShe is curious about the shape of his mouth. She wonders if this could be the one, if she could unclasp the secret pieces of her heart to him.\u201d Fela looked down, her cheeks flushing a bright", "scarlet.\nElodin stalked around to stand behind me. \u201cKvothe looks at her, and for\nthe first time he understands the impulse that first drove men to paint. To sculpt. To sing.\u201d\nHe circled us again, eventually standing between us like a priest about to perform a wedding. \u201cThere exists between them something tenuous and delicate. They can both feel it. Like static in the air. Faint as frost.\u201d\nHe looked me full in the face. His dark eyes serious. \u201cNow. What do you do?\u201d\nI looked back at him, utterly lost. If there was one thing I knew less about than naming, it was courting women.\n\u201cThere are three paths here,\u201d Elodin said to the class. He held up one finger. \u201cFirst. Our young lovers can try to express what they feel. They can try to play the half-heard song their hearts are singing.\u201d\nElodin paused for effect. \u201cThis is the path of the honest fool, and it will go badly. This thing between you is too tremulous for talk. It is a spark so faint that even the most careful breath might snuff it out.\u201d\nMaster Namer shook his head. \u201cEven if you are clever and have a way with words, you are doomed in this. Because while your mouths might speak the same language, your hearts do not.\u201d He looked at me intently. \u201cThis is an issue of translation.\u201d\nElodin held up two fingers. \u201cThe second path is more careful. You talk of small things. The weather. A familiar play. You spend time in company. You hold hands. In doing so you slowly learn the secret meanings of each other\u2019s words. This way, when the time comes you can speak with subtle meaning underneath your words, so there is understanding on both sides.\u201d\nElodin made a sweeping gesture toward me. \u201cThen there is the third path. The path of Kvothe.\u201d He strode to stand shoulder to shoulder with me, facing Fela. \u201cYou sense something between you. Something wonderful and delicate.\u201d\nHe gave a romantic, lovelorn sigh. \u201cAnd, because you desire certainty in all things, you decide to force the issue. You take the shortest route. Simplest is best, you think.\u201d Elodin extended his own hands and made wild grasping motions in Fela\u2019s direction. \u201cSo you reach out and you grab this young woman\u2019s breasts.\u201d\nThere was a burst of startled laughter from everyone except Fela and myself. I scowled. She crossed her arms in front of her chest and her flush", "spread down her neck until it was hidden by her shirt.\nElodin turned his back to her and looked me in the eye.\n\u201cRe\u2019lar Kvothe,\u201d he said seriously. \u201cI am trying to wake your sleeping\nmind to the subtle language the world is whispering. I am trying to seduce you into understanding. I am trying to teach you.\u201d He leaned forward until his face was almost touching mine. \u201cQuit grabbing at my tits.\u201d\nI left Elodin\u2019s class in a foul mood.\nThough to be honest, my mood of the last few days had been nothing but\ndifferent variations of foul. I tried to hide it from my friends, but I was starting to crack under the weight of it all.\nIt was the loss of my lute that had done it. Everything else I\u2019d been able to take in stride, the stinging burn across my chest, the constant ache in my knees, the lack of sleep. The persistent fear that I might let my Alar slip at the wrong moment and suddenly start vomiting blood.\nI\u2019d been coping with it all: my desperate poverty, my frustration with Elodin\u2019s class. Even the new undertow of anxiety that came from knowing Devi was waiting on the other side of the river with a heart full of rage, three drops of my blood, and an Alar like the ocean in a storm.\nBut the loss of my lute was too much. It wasn\u2019t just that I needed it to earn my room and board at Anker\u2019s. It wasn\u2019t just that my lute was the linchpin of my ability to make a living if I was forced out of the University.\nNo. The simple fact was that with my music, I could cope with the rest. My music was the glue that held me together. Only two days without it, and I was falling apart.\nAfter Elodin\u2019s class, I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of more hours hunched over a worktable in the Fishery. My hands ached at the thought of it, and my eyes were gritty with lack of sleep.\nSo instead I wandered back to Anker\u2019s for an early lunch. I must have looked fairly pitiful because he brought me out a double rasher of bacon with my soup, and a short beer besides.\n\u201cHow did your dinner go, if you don\u2019t mind my asking?\u201d Anker asked, leaning against the bar.\nI looked up at him. \u201cBeg your pardon?\u201d\n \n\u201cWith your young lady,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not one to pry, but the runner just dropped it off. I had to read it to see who it was for.\u201d\nI gave Anker my blankest look.\nAnker gave me a puzzled look, then frowned. \u201cDidn\u2019t Laurel give you your note?\u201d\nI shook my head and Anker cursed bitterly. \u201cI swear, some days the light should shine straight through that girl\u2019s head.\u201d He began to rummage around behind the bar. \u201cRunner dropped off a note for you day before yesterday. I told her to give it to you when you got in. Here it is.\u201d He held up a damp and rather draggled piece of paper and handed it to me.\nIt read:\nKvothe,\nI am back in town and would greatly enjoy the company of a\ncharming gentleman at dinner tonight. Sadly, there are none available. Would you care to join me at the Split Stave?\nExpectantly yours, D.\nMy spirits rose a little. Notes from Denna were a rare treat, and she\u2019d never invited me to dinner before. While I was angry that I\u2019d missed her, knowing she was back in town and eager to see me lifted my spirits considerably.\nI wolfed down my lunch, and decided to skip my Siaru lecture in favor of a trip to Imre. I hadn\u2019t seen Denna in more than a span, and spending time with her was the only thing I could think of that might improve my mood.\nMy enthusiasm dampened a bit as I made my way over the river. It was a long walk, and my knees started to ache even before I\u2019d made it to Stonebridge. The sun was piercingly bright, but not warm enough to fight the chill of the early winter wind. The dust off the road gusted into my eyes and made me choke.\nDenna wasn\u2019t at any of the inns where she occasionally stayed. She wasn\u2019t listening to music at the Taps or Goat in the Door. Neither Deoch nor Stanchion had seen her. I worried she might have left town entirely while I was occupied. She could be gone for months. She could be gone forever.\nThen I turned a corner and saw her sitting in a small public garden under a tree. She had a letter in one hand and a half-eaten pear in the other. Where had she come by a pear so late in the season?", "I was halfway across the garden before I realized she was crying. I stopped where I stood, at a loss for what to do. I wanted to help, but I didn\u2019t want to intrude. Maybe it would be best . . .\n\u201cKvothe!\u201d\nDenna tossed away the remains of the pear, hopped to her feet, and ran across the lawn toward me. She was smiling, but her eyes were rimmed with red. She wiped at her cheeks with one hand.\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d I asked.\nHer eyes welled up with new tears, but before they could fall she screwed her eyes shut and shook her head sharply. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cNot entirely.\u201d\n\u201cCan I help?\u201d I asked.\nDenna blotted her eyes with her shirtsleeve. \u201cYou help just by being here.\u201d She folded the letter into a small square and forced it into her pocket. Then she smiled again. It wasn\u2019t a forced smile, the sort you wear like a mask. She smiled a true smile, lovely despite the tears.\nThen she tilted her head to one side and gave me a closer look, her smile fading into a look of concern. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou look a little peaked.\u201d\nI gave a weak smile. Mine was forced and I knew it. \u201cI\u2019ve been having a rough time lately.\u201d\n\u201cI hope you don\u2019t feel as rough as you look,\u201d she said gently. \u201cHave you been getting enough sleep?\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t,\u201d I admitted.\nDenna drew a breath to speak, then paused and bit her lip. \u201cIs it anything you\u2019d like to talk about?\u201d she asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I could do anything to help, but . . .\u201d She shrugged and shifted her weight slightly from one foot to another. \u201cI don\u2019t sleep well myself. I know what it\u2019s like.\u201d\nHer offer of help caught me unprepared. It made me feel . . . I cannot say exactly how it made me feel. It doesn\u2019t fit easily into words.\nIt wasn\u2019t the offer of help itself. My friends had been working tirelessly to help me for days. But Sim\u2019s willingness to help was different than this. His help was dependable as bread. But knowing Denna cared, that was like a swallow of warm wine on a winter night. I could feel the sweet heat of it in my chest.\nI smiled at her. A real smile. The expression felt odd on my face and I wondered how long I\u2019d been scowling without knowing it. \u201cYou\u2019re helping just by being here,\u201d I said honestly. \u201cJust seeing you does wonders for my", "mood.\u201d\nShe rolled her eyes. \u201cOf course. The sight of my blotchy face is a\npanacea.\u201d\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t much to talk about,\u201d I said. \u201cMy bad luck got tangled up with\nmy bad decisions, and I\u2019m paying for it.\u201d\nDenna gave a chuckle that hovered on the edge of being a sob. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t\nknow anything about that sort of thing,\u201d she said, her lips making a wry twist. \u201cIt\u2019s worst when it\u2019s your own stupid fault, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nI felt my mouth curve to mimic hers. \u201cIt is,\u201d I said. \u201cTruth be told, I\u2019d prefer a bit of a distraction to a sympathetic ear.\u201d\n\u201cThat I can provide,\u201d she said, taking hold of my arm. \u201cLord knows you\u2019ve done the same for me often enough in the past.\u201d\nI fell into step alongside her. \u201cHave I?\u201d\n\u201cEndlessly,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to forget when you\u2019re around.\u201d She stopped walking for a moment and I had to stop too, as she\u2019d linked her arm in mine. \u201cThat\u2019s not right. I mean to say when you\u2019re around, it\u2019s easy to forget.\u201d\n\u201cForget what?\u201d\n\u201cEverything,\u201d she said, and for a moment her voice wasn\u2019t quite as playful. \u201cAll the bad parts of my life. Who I am. It\u2019s nice to be able to take a vacation from myself every once in a while. You help with that. You\u2019re my safe harbor in an endless, stormy sea.\u201d\nI chuckled. \u201cAm I?\u201d\n\u201cYou are,\u201d she said easily. \u201cYou are my shady willow on a sunny day.\u201d \u201cYou,\u201d I said, \u201care sweet music in a distant room.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are unexpected cake on a rainy afternoon.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re the poultice that draws the poison from my heart,\u201d I said. \u201cHmm.\u201d Denna looked uncertain. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that one. A heart\nfull of poison isn\u2019t an appealing thought.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I admitted. \u201cThat sounded better before I actually said it.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you mix your metaphors,\u201d she said. A pause.\n\u201cDid you get my note?\u201d\n\u201cI got it today,\u201d I said, letting all my regret pour into my voice. \u201cJust a\ncouple hours ago.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s too bad, it was a good dinner. I ate yours too.\u201d\nI tried to think of something to say, but she simply smiled and shook her\nhead. \u201cI\u2019m teasing. The dinner was just an excuse, actually. I have something", "to show you. You\u2019re a hard man to find. I thought I was going to have to wait until tomorrow when you sang at Anker\u2019s.\u201d\nI felt a sharp pang in my chest, so strong even Denna\u2019s presence couldn\u2019t entirely overwhelm it. \u201cIt\u2019s lucky you caught me today,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be playing tomorrow.\u201d\nShe cocked her head at me. \u201cYou always sing on Felling night. Don\u2019t change that. You\u2019re hard enough for me to find.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a fine one to talk,\u201d I said. \u201cI can never catch you in the same place twice.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re always looking for me,\u201d she said dismissively, then broke into an excited grin. \u201cBut that\u2019s beside the point. Come on. I\u2019m sure this will distract you.\u201d She began to walk faster, tugging at my arm.\nHer enthusiasm was infectious, and I found myself smiling as I followed her through the twisting streets of Imre.\nEventually we came to a small storefront. Denna stepped in front of me, almost bouncing with excitement. All signs of her weeping were gone and her eyes were bright. She put her cool hands over my face. \u201cClose your eyes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise!\u201d\nI closed my eyes, and she led me by the hand for a few steps. The inside of the shop was dim and smelled of leather. I heard a man\u2019s voice say, \u201cIs this him, then?\u201d followed by the hollow sound of things moving around.\n\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Denna said into my ear. I could hear the smile in her voice. Her breath tickled the hairs on the back of my neck.\n\u201cI have no idea,\u201d I said honestly.\nI felt the breath of her stifled laugh on my ear. \u201cOkay. Open them.\u201d\nI opened my eyes and saw a lean older man standing behind a long wooden\ncounter. An empty lute case lay open like a book in front of him. Denna had bought me a present. A case for my lute. A case for my stolen lute.\nI took a step closer. The empty case was long and slender, covered in smooth black leather. There were no hinges. Seven bright steel clasps circled the edge so the top lifted off like the lid of a box.\nThe inside was soft velvet. I reached out to touch it and found the padding soft but resilient, like a sponge. The velvet\u2019s nap was nearly half an inch thick and a deep burgundy color.\nThe man behind the counter gave a thin smile. \u201cYour lady has good taste,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a serious mind about what she desires.\u201d\nHe lifted the lid. \u201cThe leather is oiled and waxed. There\u2019s two layers with", "rock maple bows beneath.\u201d He ran a finger along the bottom half of the case, then pointed at the corresponding groove on the lid. \u201cIt fits snugly enough that no air can get in or out. So you need not worry moving from a warm, wet room into an icy night.\u201d\nHe began to snap shut the clasps around the edge of the case. \u201cThe lady objected to brass. So these are finesteel. And once they\u2019re in place, the lid is held against a gasket. You could submerse it in a river and the velvet will stay dry inside.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cEventually the water would permeate the leather, of course. But there\u2019s only so much one can do.\u201d\nFlipping the case over, he rapped a knuckle hard on the rounded bottom. \u201cI have kept the maple thin, so it is not bulky or heavy, and reinforced it with bands of Glantz steel.\u201d He gestured to where Denna stood grinning. \u201cThe lady wanted Ramston steel, but I explained that while Ramston is strong, it\u2019s also rather brittle. Glantz steel is lighter and retains its shape.\u201d\nHe looked me up and down. \u201cIf the young master wishes, he could stand on the bowl of the case without crushing it.\u201d His mouth pursed slightly and he looked down at my feet. \u201cThough I would prefer if you did not.\u201d\nHe turned the case right side up again. \u201cI have to say, this is perhaps the finest case I have made in twenty years.\u201d He slid it across the counter toward me. \u201cI hope you find it to your satisfaction.\u201d\nI was driven speechless. A rarity. I reached out and ran a hand along the leather. It was warm and smooth. I touched the steel ring where the shoulder strap would attach. I looked at Denna, who was practically dancing with delight.\nDenna stepped forward eagerly. \u201cThis is the best part,\u201d she said, flipping open the clasps with such familiar ease I could tell she\u2019d done it before. She pulled off the lid and prodded the inside with a finger. \u201cThe padding is designed to be moved and reset. So no matter what lute you have in the future, it will still fit.\n\u201cAnd look!\u201d She pressed the velvet where the neck would rest, twisted her fingers, and a lid popped up, revealing a hidden space underneath. She grinned again. \u201cThis was my idea, too. It\u2019s like a secret pocket.\u201d\n\u201cGod\u2019s body, Denna,\u201d I said. \u201cThis must have cost you a fortune.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you know,\u201d she said with an air of affected modesty. \u201cI had a little set aside.\u201d\nI ran my hand along the inside, touching the velvet. \u201cDenna, I\u2019m serious. This case must be worth as much as my lute. . . .\u201d I trailed off and my", "stomach made a nauseating twist. The lute I didn\u2019t even have anymore. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my saying so, sir,\u201d the man behind the counter said.\n\u201cUnless you have a lute of solid silver, I\u2019m guessing this case is worth a damn sight more than that.\u201d\nI ran my hands over the lid again, feeling increasingly sick to my stomach. I couldn\u2019t think of a word to say. How could I tell her someone had stolen my lute after she\u2019d gone through all the work of having this beautiful gift made for me?\nDenna grinned excitedly. \u201cLet\u2019s see how your lute fits!\u201d\nShe gestured, and the man behind the counter brought out my lute and set it in the case. It fit snugly as a glove.\nI began to cry.\n\u201cGod, I\u2019m embarrassed,\u201d I said, blowing my nose.\nDenna touched my arm lightly. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she repeated for the third\ntime.\nThe two of us sat on the curb outside the small shop. It was bad enough\nbursting into tears in front of Denna. I\u2019d wanted to compose myself without the shopkeeper staring at me too.\n\u201cI just wanted it to fit properly,\u201d Denna said, her expression stricken. \u201cI left a note. You were supposed to come to dinner so I could surprise you. You weren\u2019t even supposed to know it was gone.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously not,\u201d Denna said, her eyes starting to brim with tears. \u201cWhen you didn\u2019t show up, I didn\u2019t know what to do. I looked for you everywhere last night. I knocked on your door, but you didn\u2019t answer.\u201d She looked down at her feet. \u201cI can never find you when I go looking.\u201d\n\u201cDenna,\u201d I said. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine.\u201d\nShe shook her head vigorously, refusing to look at me as tears started to spill down her cheeks. \u201cIt\u2019s not fine. I should have known. You hold it like it\u2019s your baby. If anyone in my life had ever looked at me the way you look at that lute, I\u2019d . . .\u201d\nDenna\u2019s voice broke and she swallowed hard before words started pouring out of her again. \u201cI knew it was the most important thing in your life. That\u2019s\n \nwhy I wanted to get you somewhere safe to keep it. I just didn\u2019t think it would be so . . .\u201d She swallowed again, clenching her hands into fists. Her body was so tense she was almost trembling. \u201cGod. I\u2019m so stupid! I never think. I always do this. I ruin everything.\u201d\nDenna\u2019s hair had fallen around her face so I couldn\u2019t see her expression. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d she said, her voice low and angry. \u201cWhy am I such an idiot? Why can\u2019t I do just one thing right in my whole life?\u201d\n\u201cDenna.\u201d I had to interrupt her, as she was barely pausing to breathe. I laid my hand on her arm and she grew stiff and still. \u201cDenna, there\u2019s no way you could have known,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cYou\u2019ve been playing for how long? A month? Have you ever even owned an instrument?\u201d\nShe shook her head, her face still hidden by her hair. \u201cI had that lyre,\u201d she said softly. \u201cBut only for a few days before the fire.\u201d She looked up at last, her expression pure misery. Her eyes and nose were red. \u201cThis happens all the time. I try to do something good, but it gets all tangled up.\u201d She gave me a wretched look. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like.\u201d\nI laughed. It felt amazingly good to laugh again. It boiled up from deep in my belly and burst out of my throat like notes from a golden horn. That laugh alone was worth three hot meals and twenty hours of sleep.\n\u201cI know exactly what it\u2019s like,\u201d I said, feeling the bruises on my knees and the pull of half-healed scars along my back. I considered telling her how much of a mess I\u2019d made of retrieving her ring. Then decided it probably wouldn\u2019t help her mood if I explained how Ambrose was trying to kill me. \u201cDenna, I am the king of good ideas gone terribly wrong.\u201d\nShe smiled at that, sniffing and rubbing at her eyes with a sleeve. \u201cWe\u2019re a lovely couple of weepy idiots, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n\u201cWe are,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said again, her smile fading. \u201cI just wanted to do something nice for you. But I\u2019m no good at these things.\u201d\nI took hold of Denna\u2019s hand in both of mine and kissed it. \u201cDenna,\u201d I said with perfect honesty, \u201cthis is the kindest thing anyone has ever done for me.\u201d\nShe snorted indelicately.\n\u201cPure truth,\u201d I said. \u201cYou are my bright penny by the roadside. You are worth more than salt or the moon on a long night of walking.You are sweet wine in my mouth, a song in my throat, and laughter in my heart.\u201d\nDenna\u2019s cheeks flushed, but I rolled on, unconcerned.\n\u201cYou are too good for me,\u201d I said. \u201cYou are a luxury I cannot afford.", "Despite this, I insist you come with me today. I will buy you dinner and spend hours waxing rhapsodic over the vast landscape of wonder that is you.\u201d\nI stood and pulled her to her feet. \u201cI will play you music. I will sing you songs. For the rest of the afternoon, the rest of the world cannot touch us.\u201d I cocked my head, making it a question.\nDenna\u2019s mouth curved. \u201cThat sounds nice,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d like to get away from the world for the space of an afternoon.\u201d\nHours later I walked back to the University with a spring in my step. I whistled. I sang. My lute on my shoulder was light as a kiss. The sun was warm and soothing. The breeze was cool.\nMy luck was beginning to change.\n \n"], "CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE": ["CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE\nThe Crucible\nWITH MY LUTE BACK in my hands, the rest of my life slid easily back into balance. My work in the Fishery was easier. My classes breezed by. Elodin even seemed to make more sense.\nIt was with a light heart that I visited Simmon in the alchemy complex. He opened the door to my knocking and gestured me inside. \u201cIt worked,\u201d he said excitedly.\nI eased the door shut, and he led me to a table where a series of bottles, tubes, and coal-gas burners were arranged. Sim smiled proudly and held up a short, shallow jar of the sort you use to store face paint or rouge.\n\u201cCan you show me?\u201d I asked.\nSim lit a small coal-gas burner and the flame fanned against the bottom of a shallow iron pan. We stood quietly for a moment, listening to it hiss.\n\u201cI got new boots,\u201d Sim said conversationally, lifting up a foot so I could see.\n\u201cThey\u2019re nice,\u201d I said automatically, then paused and looked closer. \u201cAre those hobnails?\u201d I asked incredulously.\nHe grinned viciously. I laughed.\nThe iron pan grew hot, and Sim unscrewed the jar, pressing the pad of his index finger into the translucent substance inside. Then, with a little flourish, he raised his hand and pressed the tip of his finger onto the surface of the hot iron pan.\nI winced. Sim smiled smugly and stood there for the space of a long breath before pulling his finger away.\n\u201cIncredible,\u201d I said. \u201cYou guys do some crazy things over here. A heat shield.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sim said seriously. \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely the wrong way to think about it. It\u2019s not a shield. It\u2019s not an insulator. It\u2019s like an extra layer of skin that burns away before your real skin gets hot.\u201d\n\u201cLike having water on your hands,\u201d I said.", "Sim shook his head again. \u201cNo, water conducts heat. This doesn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cSo it is an insulator.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Sim said, exasperated. \u201cYou need to shut up and listen. This is\nalchemy. You know nothing about alchemy.\u201d\nI made a placating gesture. \u201cI know. I know.\u201d\n\u201cSay it, then. Say, \u2018I know nothing about alchemy.\u2019 \u201d\nI glowered at him.\n\u201cAlchemy isn\u2019t just chemistry with some extra bits,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means\nif you don\u2019t listen to me, you\u2019ll jump to your own conclusions and be dead wrong. Dead and wrong.\u201d\nI took a deep breath and let it out. \u201cOkay. Tell me.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to spread it on quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll only have about ten seconds to get it spread evenly onto your hands and lower arms.\u201d He made a gesture to his midforearm.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t rub away, but you will lose a bit if you chafe at your hands too much. Don\u2019t touch your face at all. Don\u2019t rub your eyes. Don\u2019t pick your nose. Don\u2019t bite your fingernails. It\u2019s sort of poisonous.\u201d\n\u201cSort of?\u201d I asked.\nHe ignored me, holding out the finger he\u2019d pressed onto the hot iron pan. \u201cIt\u2019s not like armor gloves. As soon as it\u2019s exposed to heat, it begins to burn away.\u201d\n\u201cWill there be any smell?\u201d I asked. \u201cAnything that will give it away?\u201d \u201cNo. It doesn\u2019t really burn technically. It simply breaks down.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does it break down into?\u201d\n\u201cThings,\u201d Simmon said testily. \u201cIt breaks down into complicated things\nyou can\u2019t understand because you don\u2019t know anything about alchemy.\u201d\n\u201cIs it safe to breathe?\u201d I amended.\n\u201cYes. I wouldn\u2019t give it to you otherwise. This is an old formula. Tried and\ntrue. Now, because it doesn\u2019t transmit heat, your hands will go straight from feeling cool to being pressed up hard against something burning hot.\u201d He gave me a pointed look. \u201cI advise you stop touching hot things before it\u2019s all used up.\u201d\n\u201cHow can I tell when it\u2019s about to be used up?\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d he said simply. \u201cWhich is why I advise using something other than your bare hands.\u201d\n\u201cWonderful.\u201d\n\u201cIf it mixes with alcohol it will turn acidic. Only mildly though. You\u2019d", "have plenty of time to wash it off. If it mixes with a little water, like your sweat, that\u2019s fine. But if it mixes with a lot of water, say a hundred parts to one, it will turn flammable.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if I mix it with piss it turns into delicious candy, right?\u201d I laughed. \u201cDid you make a bet with Wilem about how much of this I\u2019d swallow? Nothing becomes flammable when you mix it with water.\u201d\nSim\u2019s eyes narrowed. He picked up an empty crucible. \u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cFill this up then.\u201d\nStill smiling, I moved to the water canister in the corner of the room. It was identical to the ones in the Fishery. Pure water is important for artificing too, especially when you\u2019re mixing clays and quenching metals you don\u2019t want contaminated.\nI splashed some water into the crucible and brought it back to Sim. He dipped the tip of his finger into it, swirled it around, and poured it into the hot iron pan.\nThick orange flame roared up, burning three feet high until it flickered and died. Sim set down the empty crucible with a slight click and looked at me gravely. \u201cSay it.\u201d\nI looked down at my feet. \u201cI know nothing about alchemy.\u201d\nSim nodded, seeming pleased. \u201cRight,\u201d he said, turning back to the worktable. \u201cLet\u2019s go over this again.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO": ["CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO\nBlood and Ash\nLEAVES CRUNCHED UNDERFOOT AS I made my way through the forest to the north of the University. The pale moonlight filtering through the bare trees wasn\u2019t enough to see clearly, but I had made this trip several times in the last span and knew the way by heart. I smelled wood smoke long before I heard voices and glimpsed firelight through the trees.\nIt wasn\u2019t really a clearing, just a quiet space hidden behind a rocky outcrop. A few pieces of fieldstone and the trunk of a fallen tree provided makeshift seats. I had dug the fire pit myself a few days ago. It was over a foot deep and six across, lined with stones. It dwarfed the small campfire currently burning there.\nEveryone else was already there. Mola and Fela shared the log-bench. Wilem was hunkered down on a stone. Sim sat cross-legged on the ground, poking at the fire with a stick.\nWil looked up as I came out of the trees. In the flickering firelight his eyes looked dark and sunken. He and Sim had been watching over me for almost two whole span. \u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d he said.\nSim looked up to see me, cheerful as always, but there were marks of exhaustion on his face too. \u201cIs it finished?\u201d he asked, excited.\nI nodded. Unbuttoning my cuff, I rolled up my shirtsleeve to reveal an iron disk slightly larger than a commonwealth penny. It was covered in fine sygaldry and inlaid with gold. My newly finished gram. It was strapped flat against the inside of my forearm with a pair of leather cords.\nA cheer went up from the group.\n\u201cInteresting way to wear it,\u201d Mola said. \u201cFashionable in a sort of barbarian raider way.\u201d\n\u201cIt works best in contact with skin,\u201d I explained. \u201cAnd I need to keep it out of sight, since I\u2019m not supposed to know how to make one.\u201d\n\u201cPractical and stylish,\u201d Mola said.\nSimmon wandered over and peered at it, reaching out to touch it with a", "finger. \u201cIt seems so small\u2014aaaahh!\u201d Sim cried out as he jumped backward, wringing his hand. \u201cBlack damn,\u201d he swore, embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It startled me is all.\u201d\n\u201cKist and crayle,\u201d I said, my own heart racing. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201cHave you ever touched one of the Arcanum guilders?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe ones they give you when you become a full arcanist?\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cIt sort of buzzed. Made my hand go numb, like it had fallen asleep.\u201d\nSim nodded toward my gram, shaking his hand. \u201cIt feels like that. Surprised me.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know the guilders acted as grams too,\u201d I said. \u201cMakes sense though.\u201d\n\u201cHave you tested it?\u201d Wilem asked.\nI shook my head. \u201cIt seemed a little strange for me to test it myself,\u201d I admitted.\n\u201cYou want one of us to do it?\u201d Simmon laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re right, that\u2019s perfectly normal.\u201d\n\u201cI also thought it would be convenient to have a physicker nearby.\u201d I nodded in Mola\u2019s direction. \u201cJust in case.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know I was going to be needed in my professional capacity tonight,\u201d Mola protested. \u201cI didn\u2019t bring my kit.\u201d\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be necessary,\u201d I said as I brought a block of sympathy wax out of my cloak and brandished it. \u201cWho wants to do the honors?\u201d\nThere was a moment of silence, then Fela held out her hand. \u201cI\u2019ll make the doll, but I\u2019m not sticking it with a pin.\u201d\n\u201cVhenata,\u201d Wilem said.\nSimmon shrugged. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll do it. I guess.\u201d\nI handed the block of wax to Fela, and she began warming it with her\nhands. \u201cDo you want to use hair or blood?\u201d she asked softly.\n\u201cBoth,\u201d I said, trying not to let my growing anxiety show.\u201cI need to be\nabsolutely sure of it if I\u2019m going to be able sleep at night.\u201d I pulled out a hatpin, pricked the back of my hand, and watched a bright bead of blood well up.\n\u201cThat won\u2019t work.\u201d Fela said, still working the wax with her hands. \u201cBlood won\u2019t mix with wax. It\u2019ll just bead up and squish out.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how did you come by that tidbit of information?\u201d Simmon teased uneasily.", "Fela flushed, ducking her head a little, causing her long hair to cascade off her shoulder. \u201cCandles. When you make colored candles you can\u2019t use a water-based dye. It needs to be powder or oil. It\u2019s a solubility issue. Polar and nonpolar alignments.\u201d\n\u201cI love the University,\u201d Sim said to Wilem on the other side of the fire. \u201cEducated women are so much more attractive.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d like to say the same,\u201d Mola said dryly. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never known any educated men.\u201d\nI bent down and picked up a pinch of ash from the fire pit, then dusted it over the back of my hand where it absorbed the blood.\n\u201cThat should work,\u201d Fela said.\n\u201cThis flesh will burn. To ash all things return,\u201d Wilem intoned in a somber voice, then turned to Simmon. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what it says in your holy book?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my holy book,\u201d Simmon said. \u201cBut you\u2019re close. \u2018To ash all things return, so too this flesh will burn.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cYou two are certainly enjoying yourselves,\u201d Mola observed dryly.\n\u201cI am giddy thinking of a full night\u2019s sleep,\u201d Wilem said. \u201cAn evening\u2019s entertainment is coffee after cake.\u201d\nFela held out the blob of soft wax, and I pressed the wet ash into it. She kneaded it again, then began to mold it, her fingers patting it into a manshaped doll in a few deft motions. She held it out for the group to see.\n\u201cKvothe\u2019s head is way bigger than that,\u201d Simmon said with his boyish grin.\n\u201cI also have genitals,\u201d I said as I took the mommet from Fela and fixed a hair to the top of its head. \u201cBut at a certain point realism becomes unproductive.\u201d I walked over to Sim and handed him both the simulacra and the long hatpin.\nHe took one in each hand, looking uneasily back and forth between them. \u201cYou sure about this?\u201d\nI nodded.\n\u201cFair enough.\u201d Sim drew a deep breath and squared his shoulders. His forehead furrowed in concentration as he stared at the doll.\nI doubled over, shrieking and clutching at my leg.\nFela gasped. Wilem leaped to his feet. Simmon went wide-eyed with panic, holding the doll and pin stiff-armed away from each other. He looked around wildly at everyone. \u201cI . . . I didn\u2019t . . .\u201d\nI straightened up, brushing at my shirt. \u201cJust practicing,\u201d I said. \u201cWas the", "scream too girly?\u201d\nSimmon went limp with relief. \u201cDamn you,\u201d he said weakly, laughing.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not funny, you bastard.\u201d He continued to laugh helplessly as he wiped away the sheen of sweat from his forehead.\nWilem muttered something in Siaru and returned to his seat.\n\u201cYou three are as good as a traveling troupe,\u201d Mola said.\nSimmon took a deep breath and let it out slowly. He reset his shoulders and\nbrought the doll and the pin up in front of him. His hand shook. \u201cTehlu anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cYou scared the hell out of me. I can\u2019t do this now.\u201d\n\u201cFor the love of God.\u201d Mola stood and walked around the fire pit to stand over Simmon. She held out her hands. \u201cGive it to me.\u201d She took the mommet and pin and turned to look me in the eye. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d\n\u201cJust a second.\u201d After two span of constant vigilance, letting go of the Alar that protected me felt like prying open a fist gone stiff from clutching something too long.\nAfter a moment, I shook my head. I felt strange without the Alar. Almost naked. \u201cDon\u2019t hold back, but hit me in the leg, just in case.\u201d\nMola paused, murmured a binding, and drove the pin through the leg of the doll.\nSilence. Everyone watched me, motionless.\nI didn\u2019t feel a thing. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said. Everyone started to breathe again as I gave Mola a curious look. \u201cWas that really everything you had?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mola said frankly as she pulled the pin out of the doll\u2019s leg and knelt to hold it over the fire. \u201cThat was a gentle test run. I didn\u2019t want to listen to your girly scream again.\u201d She pulled the pin back out of the fire and stood up. \u201cI\u2019m going to come charging in for real this time.\u201d She poised the pin over the doll and looked at me. \u201cYou ready?\u201d\nI nodded. She closed her eyes for a moment, then murmured a binding and stabbed the hot pin through the mommet\u2019s leg. The metal of the gram went cool against the inside of my arm, and I felt a brief pressure against my calf muscle, as if someone had prodded me with a finger. I looked down to make sure Simmon wasn\u2019t getting some revenge by poking at me with a stick.\nBecause I wasn\u2019t watching, I missed what Mola did next, but I felt three more dull prods, one in each arm and the other in the thick muscle just above my knee. The gram grew colder.\nI heard Fela gasp and looked up in time to see Mola, grim-faced and resolute, toss the mommet into the heart of the campfire, murmuring another", "binding.\nAs the wax doll arced through the air, Simmon let out a startled yelp.\nWilem came to his feet again, almost lunging at Mola, but too late to stop her.\nThe mommet landed among the red coals with an explosion of sparks. My gram went almost painfully cold against my arm and I laughed crazily. Everyone turned to look at me, their expressions in various stages of horror and disbelief.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said. \u201cThis feels really weird though. It\u2019s flickery. Like standing in a warm, thick wind.\u201d\nThe gram grew icy against my arm, then the odd sensation faded as the doll melted, destroying the sympathetic link. The fire leaped up as the wax began to burn.\n\u201cDid it hurt?\u201d Simmon asked anxiously.\n\u201cNot a bit,\u201d I said.\n\u201cAnd that was everything I had,\u201d Mola said. \u201cTo do any more I would\nhave had to have a forge fire at my disposal.\u201d\n\u201cAnd she\u2019s El\u2019the,\u201d Simmon said smugly. \u201cI bet she\u2019s three times the\nsympathist Ambrose is.\u201d\n\u201cAt least three times,\u201d I said, \u201cBut if anyone was going to go out of their\nway to find a forge fire, it would be Ambrose. You can overwhelm a gram if you throw enough at it.\u201d\n\u201cSo we\u2019re going ahead with things tomorrow?\u201d Mola asked.\nI nodded. \u201cI\u2019d rather be safe than sore.\u201d\nSimmon poked a stick at the spot in the fire where the doll had landed. \u201cIf\nMola can do her worst and it just rolls off you, it might be enough to keep Devi off your back too. Give you some breathing room.\u201d\nThere was a brief moment of silence. I held my breath, hoping Fela and Mola wouldn\u2019t take any particular note of his comment.\nMola raised an eyebrow at me. \u201cDevi?\u201d\nI glared at Simmon, and he gave me a piteous look, like a dog that knows it\u2019s going to be kicked. \u201cI borrowed some money from a gaelet named Devi,\u201d I said, hoping she\u2019d be satisfied with that.\nMola continued to look at me. \u201cAnd?\u201d\nI sighed. Ordinarily I would have avoided the subject, but Mola tended to be insistent about this sort of thing, and I desperately needed her help for tomorrow\u2019s plan.", "\u201cDevi used to be a member of the Arcanum,\u201d I explained. \u201cI gave her some of my blood as collateral for a loan at the beginning of the term. When Ambrose started attacking me, I jumped to the wrong conclusion and accused her of malfeasance. Our relationship went sour after that.\u201d\nMola and Fela exchanged a look. \u201cYou do go out of your way to make life exciting, don\u2019t you?\u201d Mola said.\n\u201cI already admitted it was a mistake,\u201d I said, irritated. \u201cWhat else do you want from me?\u201d\n\u201cAre you going to be able to pay her back?\u201d Fela interjected into the conversation before things became heated between Mola and me.\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know,\u201d I admitted. \u201cWith a few lucky breaks and some long nights in the Fishery, I might be able to scrape enough together by the end of the term.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t mention the whole truth. While I might have a chance of earning enough to pay Devi back, I wouldn\u2019t have a chance in hell of making my tuition at the same time. I didn\u2019t want to spoil everyone\u2019s evening with the fact that Ambrose had won. By forcing me to spend so much time hunting for a gram, he\u2019d effectively driven me out of the University.\nFela tilted her head to one side. \u201cWhat happens if you can\u2019t pay her?\u201d\n\u201cNothing good,\u201d Wilem said darkly. \u201cThey don\u2019t call her Demon Devi for nothing.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I said. \u201cShe could sell my blood. She said she knew someone willing to buy it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure she wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d Fela said.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t blame her,\u201d I said. \u201cI knew what I was getting into when I made the deal.\u201d\n\u201cBut sh\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the way the world works,\u201d I said firmly, not wanting to dwell on it any more than necessary. I wanted the evening to end on a positive note. \u201cI, for one, am looking forward to a good night\u2019s sleep in my own bed.\u201d I looked around to see Wil and Sim nodding weary agreement. \u201cI\u2019ll see everyone tomorrow. Don\u2019t be late.\u201d\nLater that night, I slept in the luxury of my narrow bed in my tiny room. At\n \nsome point I stirred awake, dragged into consciousness by the sensation of chill metal against my skin. I smiled, rolled over, and slid back into blissful sleep.", ""], "CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE": ["CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE\nFire\nI PACKED MY TRAVELSACK carefully the next evening, anxious that I might forget some key piece of equipment. I was checking everything a third time when there was a knock on the door.\nI opened it to see a young boy of ten or so standing there, breathing hard. His eyes darted to my hair and he looked relieved. \u201cAre you Koath?\u201d\n\u201cKvothe,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd yes, I am.\u201d\n\u201cGot a message for you.\u201d He reached into a pocket and pulled out a bedraggled piece of paper.\nI held out my hand, and the boy took a step back, shaking his head. \u201cThe lady said you\u2019d give me a jot for bringing it to you.\u201d\n\u201cI doubt that,\u201d I said, holding out my hand. \u201cLet me see the note. I\u2019ll give you ha\u2019penny if it\u2019s really for me.\u201d\nThe boy scowled and grudgingly handed it over.\nIt wasn\u2019t even sealed, just folded over twice. It was also vaguely damp. Looking at the sweat-soaked boy, I could guess why.\nIt read:\nKvothe,\nYour presence is graciously requested for dinner tonight. I\u2019ve missed\nyou. I have exciting news. Please meet me at the Barrel and Boar at fifth bell.\nYours, Denna\nPstsrpt. I promised the boy ha\u2019penny.\n\u201cFifth bell?\u201d I demanded. \u201cGod\u2019s black hands! How long did you take to get here? It\u2019s past sixth bell already.\u201d\n\u201cThat en\u2019t my fault,\u201d he said, scowling fiercely. \u201cI been lookin\u2019 all over for", "hours. Anchors she said. Take it to Koath at Anchors on the other side of the river. But this place en\u2019t by the docks at all. And there en\u2019t any anchors on the sign outside. How\u2019s a one supposed to find this place?\u201d\n\u201cYou ask someone!\u201d I shouted. \u201cBlack damn boy, how thick are you?\u201d I fought down a very real urge to strangle him and took a deep breath.\nI looked out the window at the fading light. In less than half an hour my friends would be gathering around the fire pit in the woods. I didn\u2019t have time for a trip to Imre.\n\u201cRight,\u201d I said as calmly as I could manage. I dug out a stub of pencil and scratched out a note on the other side of the piece of paper.\nDenna,\nI\u2019m terribly sorry. Your runner didn\u2019t find me until past sixth bell. He\nis unutterably thick.\nI have missed you as well, and offer to put myself entirely at your\ndisposal at any hour of the day or night tomorrow. Send the boy back with your response to let me know when and where.\nFondly, Kvothe.\nPstcrpt. If the boy tries to get any money off you, give him a sharp cuff round the ear. He\u2019ll get his money when he returns your note to Anker\u2019s, assuming he doesn\u2019t get confused and eat it along the way.\nI folded it over again and pressed a blob of soft candle wax over the fold.\nI felt my purse. Over the last month I\u2019d slowly burned through the extra two talents I\u2019d borrowed from Devi. I\u2019d squandered the money on luxuries like bandages, coffee, and the materials for tonight\u2019s plan.\nAs a result, all I had to my name was four pennies and a lonely shim. I shouldered my travelsack and motioned for the boy to follow me downstairs.\nI nodded to Anker standing behind the bar, then turned to the boy. \u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cYou bollixed things up getting here, but I\u2019m going to give you a chance to make it right.\u201d I pulled out three pennies and held them out for him to see. \u201cYou head back to the Barrel and Boar, find the woman who sent you, and you give her this.\u201d I held up the note. \u201cShe\u2019ll send back a reply. You bring it here and give it to him.\u201d I pointed to Anker. \u201cAnd he\u2019ll give you the money.\u201d", "\u201cI en\u2019t an idiot,\u201d the boy said. \u201cI want ha\u2019penny first.\u201d\n\u201cI en\u2019t an idiot either,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019ll get three whole pennies when you bring her note back.\u201d\nHe glared at me, then nodded sullenly. I handed him the note, and he ran out the door.\n\u201cBoy seemed a little addled when he came in here,\u201d Anker said.\nI shook my head. \u201cHe\u2019s witless as a sheep,\u201d I said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t use him at all, but he knows what she looks like.\u201d I sighed and put the three pennies on the bar. \u201cYou\u2019d be doing me a favor if you read the note to make sure the boy isn\u2019t faking.\u201d\nAnker gave me a bit of an uncomfortable look. \u201cAnd what if it\u2019s of an, um, personal nature?\u201d\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll dance a merry little jig,\u201d I said. \u201cBut between the two of us, I hardly think that\u2019s likely.\u201d\nThe sun had set by the time I made it into the forest. Wilem was already there, kindling a fire in the wide pit. We worked together for a quarter hour, gathering enough wood to keep a bonfire burning for hours.\nSimmon arrived a few minutes later dragging a long section of dead branch. The three of us broke it into pieces and made nervous small talk until Fela came out of the trees.\nHer long hair was pinned up, leaving her elegant neck and shoulders bare. Her eyes were dark and her mouth was slightly redder than usual. Her long black gown was gathered close at her narrow waist and well-rounded hips. She was also displaying the most spectacular pair of breasts I\u2019d ever seen at that point in my young life.\nWe all gaped, but Simmon gaped openly. \u201cWow,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, you were the most beautiful woman I\u2019d ever seen before this. I didn\u2019t think there was any further for you to go.\u201d He laughed his boyish laugh and gestured at her with both hands. \u201cLook at you. You\u2019re incredible!\u201d\nFela flushed and looked away, obviously pleased.\n\u201cYou have the hardest part tonight,\u201d I said to her. \u201cI hate to ask, but . . .\u201d \u201cBut you\u2019re the only irresistibly attractive woman we know,\u201d Simmon\nchimed in. \u201cOur backup plan was to stuff Wilem into a dress. Nobody wants\n \nthat.\u201d\nWilem nodded. \u201cAgreed.\u201d\n\u201cOnly for you.\u201d Fela\u2019s mouth quirked into an ironic smile. \u201cWhen I said I\nowed you a favor, I never guessed you\u2019d ask me to go out on a date with another man.\u201d The smile went a little sour. \u201cEspecially Ambrose.\u201d\n\u201cYou only need to put up with him for an hour or two. Try to get him into Imre if you can, but anywhere at least a hundred yards from the Pony will do.\u201d\nFela sighed. \u201cAt least I\u2019ll get dinner out of this.\u201d She looked at Simmon. \u201cI like your boots.\u201d\nHe grinned. \u201cThey\u2019re new.\u201d\nI turned at the sound of approaching footsteps. Mola was the only one of us not here, but I heard murmured voices mixed with the footsteps and gritted my teeth. It was probably a pair of young lovers out enjoying the unseasonably warm weather.\nThe group of us couldn\u2019t be seen together, not tonight. It would raise too many questions. I was just about to rush out to intercept them when I recognized Mola\u2019s voice. \u201cJust wait here while I explain,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease. Just wait. It will make things easier.\u201d\n\u201cLet him pitch a twelve-color fit.\u201d A familiar female voice came out of the darkness. \u201cLet him shit out his liver for all I care.\u201d\nI stopped in my tracks. I knew the second voice, but I couldn\u2019t put my finger on who it belonged to.\nMola emerged from the dark trees. At her side was a small figure with short strawberry-blond hair. Devi.\nI stood stunned as Mola came closer, holding out her hands in a placating gesture and speaking quickly. \u201cKvothe, I know Devi from a long while ago. She showed me the ropes back when I was new here. Back before she . . . left.\u201d\n\u201cExpelled,\u201d Devi said proudly. \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of it.\u201d\nMola continued hurriedly. \u201cAfter what you said yesterday. It seemed like there was some misunderstanding. When I stopped in to ask her about it . . .\u201d She shrugged. \u201cThe whole story kind of came out. She wanted to help.\u201d\n\u201cI want a piece of Ambrose,\u201d Devi said. There was a weight of cold fury in her voice when she said his name. \u201cMy help is largely incidental.\u201d\nWilem cleared his throat. \u201cWould we be correct in assuming\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe beats his whores,\u201d Devi said, interrupting him abruptly. \u201cAnd if I", "could kill the arrogant bastard and get away with it, I would have done it years ago.\u201d She stared flatly at Wilem. \u201cAnd yes, we have a past. And no, it\u2019s none of your business. Is that enough reason for you?\u201d\nThere was a tense silence. Wilem nodded, his face carefully blank.\nDevi turned to look at me.\n\u201cDevi.\u201d I made a short bow to her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nShe blinked in surprise. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll be damned,\u201d she said, her voice sharp\nwith sarcasm. \u201cMaybe you do have half a brain in your head.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think I could trust you,\u201d I said. \u201cI was wrong, and I regret it. It\nwasn\u2019t the clearest thinking I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\nShe eyed me for a long moment. \u201cWe\u2019re not friends,\u201d she said curtly, her\nexpression still icy. \u201cBut if you\u2019re still alive at the end of all this, we\u2019ll talk.\u201d Devi looked past me and her expression softened. \u201cLittle Fela!\u201d She\nbrushed past me and gave Fela a hug. \u201cYou\u2019re all grown up!\u201d She stepped back and held Fela at arm\u2019s length, looking her over appreciatively. \u201cMy lord, you look like a ten-stripe Modegan whore! He\u2019ll love it.\u201d\nFela smiled and spun a little so the bottom of her dress flared. \u201cIt is nice to have an excuse to dress up every once and a while.\u201d\n\u201cYou should be dressing up on your own,\u201d Devi said. \u201cAnd for better men than Ambrose.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been busy. I\u2019m out of practice preening. It took me an hour to remember how to do my hair. Any advice?\u201d She held her arms out to her sides and did a slow turn.\nDevi looked her up and down with a calculating eye. \u201cYou\u2019re already better than he deserves. But you\u2019re all bare. Why don\u2019t you have any sparkle on you?\u201d\nFela looked down at her hands. \u201cRings won\u2019t work with the gloves,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t have anything nice enough to go with the dress.\u201d\n\u201cHere then,\u201d Devi tilted her head and reached up under her hair, first on one side then the other. Then she stepped closer to Fela. \u201cLord you\u2019re tall, bend down.\u201d\nWhen Fela straightened up again, she was wearing a pair of earrings that swung and caught the light of the fire.\nDevi stepped back and gave an exasperated sigh. \u201cAnd they look better on you, of course.\u201d She shook her head with irritation. \u201cGood lord woman. If I had tits like yours I\u2019d own half the world by now.\u201d\n\u201cYou and me both,\u201d Sim said enthusiastically.", "Wilem burst out laughing, then covered his face and stepped away from Sim, shaking his head and doing his best to look like he didn\u2019t have the slightest idea who was standing next to him.\nDevi looked at Sim\u2019s unashamed, boyish grin, then back to Fela. \u201cWho\u2019s the idiot?\u201d\nI caught Mola\u2019s eye and motioned her closer so we could talk. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need to, but thanks. It\u2019s a relief, knowing she\u2019s not out there plotting against me.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t assume,\u201d Mola said grimly. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen her so angry. It just seemed a shame for the two of you to be at odds. You\u2019re a lot alike.\u201d\nI darted a glance across the fire pit where Wil and Sim were cautiously approaching Devi and Fela. \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about you,\u201d Wilem said, looking at Devi. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be taller.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019s that working out for you?\u201d Devi asked dryly. \u201cThinking, I mean.\u201d\nI waved my hands to get everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d I said. \u201cWe have to get into position.\u201d\nFela nodded. \u201cI want to be there early, just in case.\u201d She straightened her gloves nervously. \u201cWish me luck.\u201d\nMola walked over and gave her a quick hug. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. Stay somewhere public with him. He\u2019ll behave better if people are watching.\u201d\n\u201cKeep asking him about his poetry,\u201d Devi advised. \u201cHe\u2019ll talk the time away.\u201d\n\u201cIf he gets impatient, compliment the wine,\u201d Mola added. \u201cSay things like, \u2018Oh I\u2019d love another glass, but I\u2019m worried it\u2019d go right to my head.\u2019 He\u2019ll buy a bottle and try and pour it into you.\u201d\nDevi nodded. \u201cIt\u2019ll keep him off you for an extra half-hour at least.\u201d She reached out and pulled up the top of Fela\u2019s dress a bit. \u201cStart conservative, then bring them out a little more toward the end of the dinner. Lean. Use your shoulders. If he keeps seeing more and more, he\u2019ll think he\u2019s getting somewhere. It\u2019ll keep him from getting grabby.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the most terrifying thing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Wilem said quietly.\n\u201cDo all the women in the world secretly know each other?\u201d Sim asked. \u201cBecause that would explain a lot.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s barely a hundred of us in the Arcanum,\u201d Devi said scathingly. \u201cThey confine us to a single wing of the Mews whether or not we actually want to live there. How can we not know each other?\u201d\nI walked over to Fela and handed her a slender oak twig. \u201cI\u2019ll signal you", "when we\u2019re done. You signal me if he walks out on you.\u201d\nFela arched an eyebrow. \u201cA woman could take that slightingly,\u201d she said,\nthen smiled and slid the twig inside one of her long black gloves. Her earrings swung and caught the light again. They were emeralds. Smooth emerald teardrops.\n\u201cThose are lovely earrings,\u201d I said to Devi. \u201cWhere did you come by them?\u201d\nHer eyes narrowed, as if she were trying to decide whether or not to take offense. \u201cA pretty young boy used them to settle his debt,\u201d she said. \u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your business.\u201d\nI shrugged. \u201cJust curious.\u201d\nFela waved and walked off, but before she made it ten feet Simmon caught up with her. He smiled awkwardly, talking and making a few emphatic gestures before handing her something. She smiled and tucked it into her long black glove.\nI turned to Devi. \u201cI assume you know the plan?\u201d\nShe nodded. \u201cHow far is it to his room?\u201d\n\u201cA little more than half a mile,\u201d I said apologetically. \u201cThe slippage\u2014\u201d Devi cut me off with a gesture. \u201cI do my own calculations,\u201d she said\nsharply.\n\u201cRight.\u201d I gestured to where my travelsack lay near the edge of the fire pit.\n\u201cThere\u2019s wax and clay in there.\u201d I handed her a slim birch twig. \u201cI\u2019ll signal you when we\u2019re in position. Start with the wax. Give it a hard half-hour, then signal and move onto the clay. Give the clay at least an hour.\u201d\nDevi snorted. \u201cWith a bonfire behind me? It\u2019ll take me fifteen minutes, tops.\u201d\n\u201cIt might not be tucked into his sock drawer, you realize. It might be locked away without much air.\u201d\nDevi waved me away. \u201cI know my business.\u201d\nI made a half bow. \u201cI leave it in your capable hands.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Mola demanded indignantly. \u201cYou lectured me for an hour!\nYou quizzed me!\u201d\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t time,\u201d I said simply. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll be here to coach her if need\nbe. Besides, Devi happens to be one of the handful of people I suspect might be a better sympathist than me.\u201d\nDevi gave me a dark look. \u201cSuspect? I beat you like a red-headed stepchild. You were my little sympathy hand puppet.\u201d", "\u201cThat was two span ago,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot since then.\u201d\n\u201cHand puppet?\u201d Sim asked Wilem. Wil made an explanatory gesture and they both burst out laughing.\nI motioned to Wilem. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\nBefore we could head out, Sim handed me a small jar.\nI gave it an odd look. I already had his alchemical concoction tucked away\nin my cloak. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just ointment in case you get burned,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut if you mix it\nwith piss, it turns into candy.\u201d Sim\u2019s expression was deadpan. \u201cDelicious candy.\u201d\nI nodded seriously. \u201cYes sir.\u201d\nMola stared in confusion. Devi pointedly ignored us and began piling wood on the fire.\nAn hour later, Wilem and I were playing cards at the Golden Pony. The common room was nearly full, and a harpist was doing a passable version of \u201cSweet Winter Rye.\u201d The room was full of murmured conversation as wealthy customers gambled, drank, and talked about whatever rich people talk about. How to properly beat the stable boy, I guessed. Or techniques for chasing the chambermaid around the estate.\nThe Golden Pony was not my sort of place. The clientele was too well- bred, the drinks too expensive, and the musicians more pleasing to the eye than the ear. Despite all this, I\u2019d been coming here for nearly two span, making a show of trying to climb the social ladder. That way, no one could say it was odd I was here on this particular night.\nWilem took a drink and shuffled the cards. My own drink sat half-finished and warm. It was only a simple ale, but given the prices at the Pony I was now, quite literally, penniless.\nWil dealt another hand of breath. I picked up my cards carefully, as Simmon\u2019s alchemical concoction made my fingers ever so slightly sticky. We might as well have been playing with blank cards. I drew and threw randomly, pretending to concentrate on the game when really I was waiting, listening.\nI felt a slight tickle in the corner of my eye and reached to rub it away with\n \nmy fingers, catching myself at the last second with my hand upraised. Wilem stared at me from across the table, his eyes alarmed, and gave his head a small, firm shake. I went motionless for a moment, then slowly lowered my hand.\nI was so busy trying to appear nonchalant that when the cry came from outside I was actually startled. It cut through the low murmur of conversation as only a shrill voice filled with panic can. \u201cFire! Fire!\u201d\nEveryone in the Pony froze for a moment. This always happens when people are startled and confused. They take a second to look around, smell the air, and think things like, \u201cDid he just say fire?\u201d or \u201cFire? Where? Here?\u201d\nI didn\u2019t hesitate. I leaped to my feet and made a show of looking around wildly, obviously trying to search out the fire. By the time everyone else in the common room started to move, I was already dashing for the stairs.\n\u201cFire!\u201d The cries continued from outside. \u201cOh God. Fire!\u201d\nI smiled as I listened to Basil overact his small part. I didn\u2019t know him well enough to let him in on the whole plan, but it was vital that someone notice the fire early so I could spring into action. The last thing I wanted to do was accidentally burn down half the inn.\nI reached the top of the steps and looked around the upper floor of the Golden Pony. There were already footsteps pounding up the stairs behind me. A few wealthy lodgers opened their doors, peering into the hallway.\nThere were faint wisps of smoke curling underneath the door to Ambrose\u2019s rooms. Perfect.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s over here!\u201d I shouted, sliding a hand into one of my cloak\u2019s pockets as I ran to the door.\nIn the long days we spent searching the Archives, I\u2019d found reference to a great many interesting pieces of artificery. One of them was an elegant piece of artificery called a siege stone.\nIt worked on the most basic sympathetic principles. A crossbow stores energy and uses it to shoot a bolt a long distance at a great speed. A siege stone was an inscribed piece of lead that stores energy and uses it to move itself about six inches with the force of a battering ram.\nReaching the middle of the hallway, I braced myself and charged Ambrose\u2019s door with my shoulder. I also struck it with the siege stone I held concealed against the flat of my hand.\nThe thick-timbered door staved in like a barrel struck by an anvil hammer. There were startled gasps and exclamations from everyone in the hallway. I", "rushed inside, trying desperately to keep the manic grin off my face. Ambrose\u2019s sitting room was dark, and made darker by a haze of smoke in\nthe air. I saw flickering firelight inside, off to the left. From my previous visit I knew it was his bedroom.\n\u201cHello?\u201d I shouted. \u201cIs everyone all right?\u201d I pitched my voice carefully: Bold but concerned. No panic, of course. I was, after all, the hero of this scene.\nSmoke was thick in the bedroom, catching the orange firelight and stinging my eyes. There was a massive wooden chest of drawers against the wall, big as a workbench in the Fishery. Flames licked and flickered around the edges of the drawers. Apparently Ambrose had been keeping the mommet in his sock drawer.\nI picked up a nearby chair and used it to smash the window I\u2019d climbed through several nights ago. \u201cClear the street!\u201d I shouted down.\nThe bottommost left drawer seemed to be burning the hottest, and when I pulled it open the smoldering clothes inside caught the air hungrily and burst into flame. I smelled burning hair and hoped I hadn\u2019t lost my eyebrows. I didn\u2019t want to spend the next month looking constantly surprised.\nAfter the initial flare up, I drew a deep breath, stepped forward, and pulled the heavy wooden drawer free of the bureau with my bare hands. It was full of smoldering, blackened cloth, but as I ran to the window, I could hear something hard in the bottom of the drawer rattling against the wood. It tumbled as I threw it out the window, clothes bursting into flame as the wind caught them.\nNext I yanked out the top right-hand drawer. As soon as I pulled it free, smoke and flame poured out in an almost solid mass.With these two drawers gone, all the empty space inside the bureau formed a crude chimney, giving the fire all the air it wanted. As I heaved the second drawer out the window, I could actually hear the hollow rush of fire spreading through the varnished wood and the clothes inside.\nDown in the street, people drawn by the commotion were doing their best to put out the flaming debris. In the middle of the small crowd, Simmon stomped about in his new hobnail boots, smashing things to flinders like a boy splashing in puddles after the first spring rain. Even if the mommet had survived the fall, it wouldn\u2019t survive that.\nThis was more than mere pettiness. Devi had signaled me twenty minutes ago, letting me know she\u2019d already tried the wax mommet. Since there had", "been no result, it meant Ambrose had undoubtedly used my blood to make a clay mommet of me. A simple fire wasn\u2019t going to destroy it.\nOne by one, I grabbed the other drawers and threw them into the street as well, pausing to pull down the thick velvet curtains around Ambrose\u2019s bed to shield my hands from the heat of the fire. This also might seem petty, but it wasn\u2019t. I was terrified of burning my hands. Every talent I had revolved around them.\nPetty was when I kicked the chamber pot on my way back to the bureau. It was the expensive kind, fine glazed pottery. It tipped over and rolled crazily across the floor until it struck the hearth and shattered. Suffice to say that what spilled across Ambrose\u2019s rugs was not delicious candy.\nFlame flickered openly in the spaces where the drawers had been, lighting the room while the broken window let in some clear air. Eventually someone else was brave enough to make their way into the room. He used one of the blankets off Ambrose\u2019s bed to protect his hands and helped me throw the last several burning drawers out the window. It was hot, sooty work, and even with the help, I was coughing by the time the last of the drawers went tumbling onto the street.\nIt was over in less than three minutes. A few quick-thinking bar patrons brought in pitchers of water and doused the still-burning frame of the empty bureau. I tossed the smoldering velvet drapes out the window, shouting, \u201cLook out down there!\u201d so Simmon would know to retrieve my siege stone from the pile of tangled cloth.\nLamps were lit and the smoke thinned as cool night air blew in through the broken window. People filtered into the room to help, or gawk, or gossip. A cluster of amazed onlookers gathered around Ambrose\u2019s staved-in door, and I idly wondered what sort of rumors might spring out of tonight\u2019s performance.\nOnce the room was properly lit, I marveled at the damage the fire had done. The chest of drawers was little more than a collection of charred sticks, and the plaster wall behind it was cracked and blistered from the heat. The white ceiling was painted with a wide fan of black soot.\nI caught my reflection in the dressing-room mirror and was pleased to see my eyebrows were more or less intact. I was mightily disheveled, my hair in disarray and my face smudged with sweat and dark ash. The whites of my eyes looked very bright against the black of my face.\nWilem joined me and helped bandage up my left hand. It wasn\u2019t really burned, but I knew it would look odd if I walked away entirely unscathed.", "Aside from a little lost hair, my worst injury was actually the holes charred in my long sleeves. Another shirt ruined. If this kept up I\u2019d be naked by the end of the term.\nI sat on the edge of the bed and watched as people brought more water to splash on the bureau. I pointed out a charred ceiling beam, and they doused it too, sending up a sharp hiss and a cloud of steam and smoke. People continued to wander in and out, looking at the wreckage and muttering to each other while shaking their heads.\nJust as Wil was finishing my bandage, the sound of galloping hooves on cobblestones came through the broken window, temporarily overwhelming the noise of fiercely stomping hobnailed boots.\nLess than a minute later, I heard Ambrose in the hallway. \u201cWhat in the name of God is going on here? Get out! Out!\u201d\nCursing and shoving people aside, Ambrose made his entrance. When he saw me sitting on his bed he pulled up short. \u201cWhat are you doing in my rooms?\u201d he demanded.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, then looked around. \u201cThese are your rooms?\u201d Keeping the proper amount of dismay in my tone wasn\u2019t easy, as my voice was rough with smoke. \u201cI just burned myself saving your things?\u201d\nAmbrose\u2019s eyes narrowed, then went to the charred wreckage of his bureau. His eyes flicked back to me, then went wide with sudden realization. I fought the urge to grin.\n\u201cGet out of here you filthy, thieving Ruh,\u201d he spat venomously. \u201cI swear if anything\u2019s missing, I\u2019ll bring the constable down on you. I\u2019ll have you on the iron law and see you hanged.\u201d\nI drew a breath to respond, then started to cough uncontrollably and had to settle for glaring at him.\n\u201cGood job, Ambrose,\u201d Wilem said sarcastically. \u201cYou caught him. He stole your fire.\u201d\nOne of the onlookers chimed in, \u201cYeah, make him put it back!\u201d\n\u201cGet out!\u201d Ambrose shouted, red-faced and furious. \u201cAnd take that filthy shim with you or I\u2019ll give you both the thrashing you deserve.\u201d I watched the bystanders stare at Ambrose, appalled by his behavior.\nI gave him a long, proud look, playing the scene for all it was worth. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d I said with injured dignity, and shouldered past him, jostling him roughly out of the way.\nAs I was leaving, a fat, florid man in a waistcoat staggered through the", "ruined door to Ambrose\u2019s rooms. I recognized him as the owner of the Golden Pony.\n\u201cWhat the devil\u2019s been going on here?\u201d he demanded.\n\u201cCandles are dangerous things,\u201d I said. I looked over my shoulder and met Ambrose\u2019s eye. \u201cHonestly boy,\u201d I said to him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you were thinking. You\u2019d think a member of the Arcanum would have more sense.\u201d\nWil, Mola, Devi, and I were sitting around what was left of the bonfire when we heard the crackle of footsteps coming through the trees. Fela was still dressed elegantly, but her hair was unpinned. Sim was making his way carefully alongside her, absentmindedly holding branches out of her way as they moved through the undergrowth.\n\u201cAnd just where have you two been?\u201d Devi asked.\n\u201cI had to walk back from Imre,\u201d Fela explained. \u201cSim came to meet me halfway. Don\u2019t worry mother, he was a perfect gentleman.\u201d\n\u201cI hope it wasn\u2019t too bad for you,\u201d I said.\n\u201cDinner was about what you would expect,\u201d Fela admitted. \u201cBut the second part made it all worthwhile.\u201d\n\u201cSecond part?\u201d Mola asked.\n\u201cOn our way back, Sim took me to see the wreckage at the Pony. I stopped to have a word with Ambrose. I\u2019ve never had so much fun.\u201d Fela\u2019s smile was wicked. \u201cI was perfectly huffy.\u201d\n\u201cShe was,\u201d Simmon said. \u201cIt was brilliant.\u201d\nFela faced Sim and set her hands on her hips. \u201cRun off on me, will you?\u201d Sim screwed his face up into an exaggerated scowl and gestured wildly.\n\u201cListen to me, you daft bint!\u201d he said in a fair imitation of Ambrose\u2019s Vintish accent. \u201cMy rooms were on fire!\u201d\nFela turned away, throwing up her hands. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me! You ran off to be with some whore. I\u2019ve never been so humiliated in my life! I never want to see you again!\u201d\nWe applauded. Fela and Sim linked arms and took a bow.\n\u201cIn the interest of pure accuracy,\u201d Fela said in an offhand way, \u201cAmbrose didn\u2019t use the words \u2018daft bint.\u2019\u201d She didn\u2019t let go of Sim\u2019s arm.\nSimmon looked a little embarrassed. \u201cYes, well. There are some things\n \nyou don\u2019t call a lady, even in fun.\u201d He reluctantly let go of Fela and sat on the trunk of the fallen tree. Fela sat next to him.\nFela leaned close to him and whispered something. Sim laughed, shaking his head. \u201cPlease?\u201d Fela asked, laying her hand on his arm. \u201cKvothe doesn\u2019t have his lute. Someone has to entertain us.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, Okay.\u201d Simmon said, obviously a little flustered. He closed his eyes for a moment, then spoke in a sonorous voice:\nFast came our Fela fiery eyes flashing, Crossing the cobbles strength in her stride. Came she to Ambrose all ashes around him Grim was his gazing fearsome his frown. Still Fela feared not brave was her bo\u2014\nSimmon came to an abrupt stop before saying the word \u201cbosom\u201d and blushed red as a beet. Devi gave an earthy chuckle from where she sat on the other side of the fire.\nEver the good friend, Wilem stepped in with a distracting question. \u201cWhat is that pause you keep doing?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s like you can\u2019t catch your breath.\u201d\n\u201cI asked that too,\u201d Fela said, smiling.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something they use in Eld Vintic verse,\u201d Sim explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a break in the line called a caesura.\u201d\n\u201cYou are dangerously well informed about poetry, Sim,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m close to losing respect for you.\u201d\n\u201cHush,\u201d Fela said. \u201cI think it\u2019s lovely. You\u2019re just jealous he can do it off the cuff.\u201d\n\u201cPoetry is a song without music,\u201d I said loftily. \u201cA song without music is like a body without a soul.\u201d\nWilem raised his hand before Simmon could respond. \u201cBefore we become mired in philosophical talk, I have a confession to make,\u201d Wilem said somberly. \u201cI dropped a poem in the hallway outside Ambrose\u2019s rooms. It was an acrostic that spoke of his powerful affection for Master Hemme.\u201d\nWe all laughed, but Simmon seemed to find it particularly funny. It took him a long while to catch his breath. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be more perfect if we planned it,\u201d he said. \u201cI bought a few pieces of women\u2019s clothing and scattered them in with what was out on the street. Red satin. Lacy bits. A", "whalebone corset.\u201d\nThere was more laughter. Then they turned their eyes to me.\n\u201cAnd what did you do?\u201d Devi prompted.\n\u201cOnly what I set out to,\u201d I said somberly. \u201cOnly what was necessary to\ndestroy the mommet so I could sleep safe at night.\u201d\n\u201cYou kicked over his chamber pot,\u201d Wilem said.\n\u201cTrue,\u201d I admitted. \u201cAnd I found this.\u201d I held up a piece of paper.\n\u201cIf that\u2019s one of his poems,\u201d Devi said, \u201cI\u2019d suggest you burn it quickly\nand wash your hands.\u201d\nI unfolded the slip of paper and read it aloud. \u201cLedger mark 4535: Ring.\nWhite gold. Blue smokestone. Remount setting and polish.\u201d I folded it carefully and put it in a pocket. \u201cTo me,\u201d I said, \u201cThis is better than a poem.\u201d\nSim sat upright. \u201cIs that a pawnslip for your lady\u2019s ring?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a claim slip for a jeweler, if I don\u2019t miss my guess. But yes, it\u2019s for her ring,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s not my lady, by the by.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m lost,\u201d Devi said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s how all this started,\u201d Wilem said. \u201cKvothe was trying to reclaim a bit of property for a girl he fancies.\u201d\n\u201cSomeone should fill me in,\u201d Devi said. \u201cI seem to have come in halfway through the story.\u201d\nI leaned back against a piece of fieldstone, content to let my friends tell the story.\nThe slip of paper hadn\u2019t been in Ambrose\u2019s chest of drawers. It hadn\u2019t been on the hearth or his bedside table. It hadn\u2019t been on his jewelry tray or his writing desk.\nIt had, in fact, been in Ambrose\u2019s purse. I\u2019d lifted it off him in a fit of pique half a minute after he called me a filthy, thieving Ruh. It had almost been a reflex action as I\u2019d brushed roughly past him on my way out of his rooms at the Pony.\nBy strange coincidence, the purse also contained money. Almost six talents. Not a great deal of coin as far as Ambrose was concerned. Enough for an extravagant night out with a lady. But for me it was a great deal of money, so much I almost felt guilty for taking it. Almost.", ""], "CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR": ["CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR\nBaubles\nTHERE WAS NO NOTE for me from Denna when I returned to Anker\u2019s that night. Nor was there one waiting in the morning. I wondered if the boy had ever found her with my message, or if he had simply given up, or dropped it in the river, or eaten it.\nThe next morning I decided my mood was too good to spoil it with the inevitable madness of Elodin\u2019s class. So I shouldered my lute and headed over the river to look for Denna. It had taken longer than I\u2019d planned, but I was eager to see the look on her face when I finally returned her ring.\nI walked into the jeweler\u2019s and smiled at the small man standing behind a low display case. \u201cAre you finished with the ring?\u201d\nHis forehead creased. \u201cI . . . I beg your pardon, sir?\u201d\nI sighed and dug around in my pocket, eventually producing the slip of paper.\nHe peered at it, then his face lit with understanding. \u201cAh, yes. Of course. Just a moment.\u201d He made his way through a door into the back of the shop.\nI relaxed a bit. This was the third shop I\u2019d visited. The other conversations hadn\u2019t worked out nearly this well.\nThe tiny man bustled out of the back room. \u201cHere we are, sir.\u201d He held up the ring. \u201cRight as rain again. Lovely stone too, if you don\u2019t mind my saying.\u201d\nI held it to the light. It was Denna\u2019s ring. \u201cYou do good work,\u201d I said.\nHe smiled at this. \u201cThank you, sir. All told, the work came to forty-five pennies.\u201d\nI gave a small, silent sigh. It had been too much to hope that Ambrose had paid for the work in advance. I juggled numbers in my head and counted a\n \ntalent and six jots onto the glass top of the display case. As I did, I noticed it had the slightly oily texture of twice-tough glass. I ran my hand over it, wondering idly if it was one of the pieces I had made at the Fishery.\nAs the jeweler gathered up the coins, I noticed something else. Something inside the case.\n\u201cA bauble caught your eye?\u201d he asked smoothly.\nI pointed at a necklace in the center of the case.\n\u201cYou have excellent taste,\u201d he said, pulling out a key and unlocking a\npanel in the back of the case. \u201cThis is quite an exceptional piece. Not only is the setting elegant, but the stone itself is remarkably fine. You don\u2019t often see an emerald of this quality cut in a long drop.\u201d\n\u201cIs it your work?\u201d I asked.\nThe jeweler gave a dramatic sigh. \u201cAlas, I cannot claim that distinction. A young woman brought it in several span ago. She had more need of money than adornment it seems, and we came to an arrangement.\u201d\n\u201cHow much would you like for it?\u201d I asked as casually as possible.\nHe told me. It was a staggering amount of money. More money than I had ever seen in one place. Enough money that a woman might live comfortably in Imre for several years. Enough money for a fine new harp. Enough for a lute of solid silver, or, if she desired, a case for such a lute.\nThe jeweler sighed again, shaking his head at the sad state of the world. \u201cIt is a shame,\u201d he said. \u201cWho can tell what drives young women to such things.\u201d Then he looked up and smiled, holding the teardrop emerald to the light with an expectant expression. \u201cStill, her loss is your gain.\u201d\nSince Denna had mentioned the Barrel and Boar in her note, I decided to start looking for her there. My lute case hung heavier on my shoulder now that I knew what she\u2019d given up to pay for it. Still, one good turn deserves another, and I hoped the return of her ring would help balance things between us.\nBut the Barrel and Boar wasn\u2019t an inn, merely a restaurant. Without any real hope, I asked the host if someone might have left a message for me. Nobody had. I asked if he remembered a woman who had been there the night before? Dark-haired? Lovely?\nHe nodded at that. \u201cShe waited for a long while,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember\n \nthinking, \u2018Who would keep a woman like that waiting?\u2019 \u201d\nYou would be amazed at how many inns and boarding houses there are,\neven in a smallish city like Imre.", ""], "CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE": ["CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE\nSecrets\nTWO DAYS LATER I was heading off to the Fishery, hoping some honest work would clear my head and make me better able to tolerate two hours of Elodin\u2019s jackassery. I was three steps from the door, when I saw a young girl in a blue cloak hurrying across the courtyard toward me. Underneath the hood, her face was a startling mix of excitement and anxiety.\nWe made eye contact and she stopped moving toward me. Then, still eyeing me, she made a motion so furtive and stiff I couldn\u2019t understand what she meant until she repeated it: she wanted me to follow her.\nPuzzled, I nodded. She turned and walked out of the courtyard, moving with the awkward stiffness of someone trying desperately to be nonchalant.\nI followed her. Under other circumstances I would have thought she was a shill luring me into a dark alley where thugs would kick out my teeth and take my purse. But there weren\u2019t any decently dangerous alleys this close to the University, and it was a sunny afternoon besides.\nEventually she stepped into a deserted piece of road behind a glassblower and a clocksmith\u2019s shop. She looked around nervously, then turned, her face beaming under the shelter of her hood. \u201cI finally found you!\u201d she said breathlessly.\nShe was younger than I\u2019d thought, no more than fourteen. Curls of mousy brown hair framed her pale face and fought to escape the hood. Still, I couldn\u2019t place her. . . .\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a drummer of a time tracking you down,\u201d she said. \u201cI spend so much time here my ma thinks I have a beau at the University,\u201d she said the last almost shyly, her mouth making a tiny curve.\nI opened my mouth to admit I didn\u2019t have the slightest idea who she was. But before I could get a word out, she spoke again. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she said. \u201cI hain\u2019t let anyone know I was coming to see you.\u201d Her bright eyes went dark with anxiety, like a pool when the sun goes behind a cloud. \u201cI know it\u2019s safer that way.\u201d", "It was only when her face went dark with worry that I recognized her. She was the young girl I\u2019d met in Trebon when I\u2019d gone to investigate rumors of the Chandrian.\n\u201cNina,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cLooking for you.\u201d She thrust out her chin proudly. \u201cI knew you must be from here cause you knew all sorts of magic.\u201d She looked around. \u201cBut it\u2019s bigger than I thought it would be. I know you didn\u2019t give anyone in Trebon your name because then they\u2019d have power over you, but I have to say it makes you terribly hard to find.\u201d\nHad I not told anyone my name in Trebon? Some of my memories of that time were vague, as I\u2019d had a bit of a concussion. It was probably for the best I\u2019d kept myself anonymous, given that I\u2019d been responsible for burning down a sizable portion of the town.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to put you to so much work,\u201d I said, still not sure what this was all about.\nNina took a step closer. \u201cI had dreams after you left,\u201d she said, her voice low and confidential. \u201cBad dreams. I thought they were coming for me because of what I told you.\u201d She gave me a meaningful look. \u201cBut then I started sleeping with the amulet you gave me. I made my prayers every night, and the dreams went away.\u201d One of her hands absentmindedly fingered a piece of bright metal that hung around her neck on a leather cord.\nI realized with sudden guilt that I\u2019d inadvertently lied to Master Kilvin. I hadn\u2019t sold anyone a charm, or even made anything that would look like one. But I had given Nina an engraved piece of metal and told her it was an amulet to set her mind at ease. Before that she\u2019d been on the edge of nervous hysteria, worried that demons were going to kill her.\n\u201cSo it\u2019s been working then?\u201d I asked, trying not to sound guilty.\nShe nodded. \u201cAs soon as I had it under my pillow and said my prayers, I slept like a babe at the tit. Then I started having my special dream,\u201d she said, and smiled up at me. \u201cI dreamed about the big pot Jimmy showed me before those folks were kilt up at the Mauthen farm.\u201d\nI felt hope rise in my chest. Nina was the only person alive who had seen the ancient piece of pottery. It had been covered with pictures of the Chandrian, and they are jealous of their secrets.\n\u201cYou remembered something about the pot with the seven people painted on it?\u201d I asked excitedly.\nShe hesitated for a moment, frowning. \u201cThere was eight of them,\u201d she said.", "\u201cNot seven.\u201d\n\u201cEight?\u201d I asked. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\nShe nodded earnestly. \u201cI thought I told you before.\u201d\nThe rising hope in my chest suddenly fell into the pit of my stomach where\nit lay heavy and sour. There were seven Chandrian. It was one of the few things I knew for certain about them. If there were eight people on the painted vase Nina had seen . . .\nNina continued to chatter away, unaware of my disappointment. \u201cI dreamed about the pot for three nights in a row,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it weren\u2019t a bad dream at all. I woke up all rested and happy every night. I knew then what God was telling me to do.\u201d\nShe began to root around in her pockets and brought out a length of polished horn more than a handspan long and big around as my thumb. \u201cI remembered how you were so curious about the pot. But I couldn\u2019t tell you anything cause I\u2019d only seen it for a moment.\u201d She handed me the piece of horn, proudly.\nI looked down at the cylindrical piece of horn in my hands, not sure what I was supposed to do with it. I looked up at her, confused.\nNina gave an impatient sigh and took the horn back. She twisted it, removing the end like a cap. \u201cMy brother made this for me,\u201d she said as she carefully drew a rolled piece of parchment from inside the horn. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. He doesn\u2019t know what it was for.\u201d\nShe handed me the parchment. \u201cIt\u2019s not very good,\u201d she said nervously. \u201cMy mum lets me help paint the pots, but this is different. It\u2019s harder doing people than flowers and designs. And it\u2019s hard getting something right that you can only see in your head.\u201d\nI was amazed my hands weren\u2019t shaking. \u201cThis is what was painted on the vase?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one side of it,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething round like this, you can only see a third of it when you\u2019re looking at it from one side.\u201d\n\u201cSo you dreamed of a different side each night?\u201d I asked.\nShe shook her head. \u201cJust this side. Three nights in a row.\u201d\nI slowly unrolled the piece of paper and instantly recognized the man she\nhad painted. His eyes were pure black. In the background there was a bare tree, and he was standing on a circle of blue with a few wavy lines on it.\n\u201cThat\u2019s supposed to be water,\u201d she said, pointing. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to paint water though. And he\u2019s supposed to be standing on it. There were drifts of snow", "around him too, and his hair was white. But I couldn\u2019t get the white paint to work. Mixing paints for paper is harder than glazes for pots.\u201d\nI nodded, not trusting myself to speak. It was Cinder, the one who had killed my parents. I could see his face in my mind without even trying. Without even closing my eyes.\nI unrolled the paper further. There was a second man, or rather the shape of a man in a great hooded robe. Inside the cowl of the robe was nothing but blackness. Over his head were three moons, a full moon, a half moon, and one that was just a crescent. Next to him were two candles. One was yellow with a bright orange flame. The other candle sat underneath his outstretched hand: it was grey with a black flame, and the space around it was smudged and darkened.\n\u201cThat\u2019s supposed to be shadow, I think,\u201d Nina said, pointing to the area under his hand. \u201cIt was more obvious on the pot. I had to use charcoal for that. I couldn\u2019t get it right with paint.\u201d\nI nodded again. This was Haliax. The leader of the Chandrian. When I\u2019d seen him he had been surrounded by an unnatural shadow. The fires around him had been strangely dimmed, and the cowl of his cloak had been black as the bottom of a well.\nI finished unrolling the paper, revealing a third figure, larger than the other two. He wore armor and an open-faced helmet. On his chest was a bright insignia that looked like an autumn leaf, red on the outside brightening to orange near the middle, with a straight black stem.\nThe skin of his face was tan, but the hand he held poised upright was a bright red. His other hand was hidden by a large, round object that Nina had somehow managed to color a metallic bronze. I guessed it was his shield.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the worst,\u201d Nina said, her voice subdued.\nI looked down at her. Her face looked somber, and I guessed she\u2019d taken my silence the wrong way. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t say that,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019ve done a wonderful job.\u201d\nNina gave a faint smile. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was hard to do. I got the copper pretty okay here.\u201d She touched his shield. \u201cBut this red,\u201d her finger brushed his upraised hand, \u201cis supposed to be blood. He\u2019s got blood all over his hand.\u201d She tapped his chest. \u201cAnd this was brighter, like something burning.\u201d\nI recognized him then. It wasn\u2019t a leaf on his chest. It was a tower wrapped in flame. His bloody, outstretched hand wasn\u2019t demonstrating something. It", "was making a gesture of rebuke toward Haliax and the rest. He was holding up his hand to stop them. This man was one of the Amyr. One of the Ciridae.\nThe young girl shivered and pulled her cloak around herself. \u201cI don\u2019t like looking at him even now,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were all awful to look at. But he was the worst. I can\u2019t get faces right, but his was terrible grim. He looked so angry. He looked like he was ready to burn down the whole world.\u201d\n\u201cIf this is one side,\u201d I asked, \u201cDo you remember the rest of it?\u201d\n\u201cNot like this. I remember there was a woman with no clothes on, and a broken sword, and a fire. . . .\u201d She looked thoughtful, then shook her head again. \u201cLike I told you, I only saw it for a quick second when Jimmy showed me. I think an angel helped me remember this piece in a dream so I could paint it down and bring it to you.\u201d\n\u201cNina,\u201d I said. \u201cThis is really amazing. You really have no idea how incredible this is.\u201d\nHer face lit up again with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m glad of that. I\u2019ve had a world of trouble making it.\u201d\n\u201cWhere did you get the parchment?\u201d I asked, noticing it for the first time. It was actual vellum, high-quality stuff. Far better than anything I could afford.\n\u201cI practiced on some boards at first,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I knew that wasn\u2019t going to work. Plus I knew I\u2019d have to hide it. So I snuck into the church and cut some pages out of their book,\u201d she said the last without the faintest hint of self-consciousness.\n\u201cYou cut this out of the Book of the Path?\u201d I asked, somewhat aghast. I\u2019m not particularly religious, but I do have a vestigial sense of propriety. And after so many hours in the Archives, the thought of cutting pages out of a book was horrifying to me.\nNina nodded easily. \u201cIt seemed the best thing, since an angel gave me the dream. And they can\u2019t lock the church up properly at night, since you tore off the front of the building, and killed that demon.\u201d She reached over and brushed at the paper with a finger. \u201cIt hain\u2019t that hard. All you need to do is take a knife and scrape at it a bit and all the words come off.\u201d She pointed. \u201cI was careful never to scrape off Tehlu\u2019s name though. Or Andan\u2019s, or any of the other angels,\u201d she added piously.\nI looked at it more closely and saw it was true. She\u2019d painted the Amyr so the words Andan and Ordal rested directly on top of his shoulders, one on each side. Almost as if she were hoping the names would weigh him down,", "or trap him.\n\u201cPlus you said I shouldn\u2019t tell anyone what I saw,\u201d Nina said. \u201cAnd\npainting is like telling with pictures instead of words. So I figured it would be safer to use pages from Tehlu\u2019s book, because no demon would ever look at a page of that book. Especially one with Tehlu\u2019s name still writ all over it.\u201d She looked up at me proudly.\n\u201cThat was cleverly done,\u201d I said approvingly.\nThe belling tower began to ring the hour, and Nina\u2019s expression flared into sudden panic. \u201cOh no!\u201d she said pitifully. \u201cI should have been back at the docks by now. My mum\u2019s going to give me a birching!\u201d\nI laughed. Partly because I was utterly amazed by this unexpected piece of luck. And partly at the thought of a young girl brave enough to defy the Chandrian, but still terrified of making her mother angry. Such is the way of the world.\n\u201cNina, you\u2019ve done me a wonderful favor. If you ever need anything, or if you have another dream, you can find me at an inn called Anker\u2019s. I play music there.\u201d\nHer eyes went wide. \u201cIs it magic music?\u201d\nI laughed again. \u201cSome people think so.\u201d\nShe looked around nervously. \u201cI really have to go!\u201d she said, then waved\nand took off running toward the river, the wind blowing her hood back as she went.\nI carefully rerolled the piece of paper and tucked it back into the hollow piece of horn. My mind spun with what I had just learned. I thought of what I\u2019d heard Haliax say to Cinder all those years ago: Who keeps you safe from the Amyr, the Singers, the Sithe?\nAfter my months of searching, I was fairly certain the Archives held nothing more than faerie stories about the Chandrian. Nobody considered them more real than shamble-men or faeries.\nBut everyone knew about the Amyr. They were the bright knights of the Aturan Empire. They were the strong hand of the church for two hundred years. They were the subject of a hundred stories and songs.\nI knew my history. The Amyr had been founded by the Tehlin Church in the early days of the Aturan Empire.\nBut the pottery Nina had seen had been much older than that.\nI knew my history. The Amyr had been condemned and disbanded by the church before the empire fell.", "But I knew the Chandrian were still afraid of them today. It seemed like there was more to the story.", ""], "CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX": ["CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX\nAll This Knowing\nDAYS PASSED, AND I invited Wil and Sim across the river to celebrate our successful campaign against Ambrose.\nGiven my taste for sounten, I was not much of a drinker, but Wil and Sim were kind enough to demonstrate the fine points of the art. We visited several different taverns, just for variety, but eventually we ended up back at the Eolian. I preferred it because of the music, Simmon because of the women, and Wilem because it served scutten.\nI was moderately well-buttered when I was called up onto the stage, but it takes more than a little drink to make me fumble-fingered. Just to prove I was not drunk, I made my way through \u201cWhither With He With the Withee,\u201d a song that\u2019s difficult enough to articulate when sober as a stone.\nThe audience loved it, and showed its appreciation in the appropriate way. And, since I was not drinking sounten that night, much of the evening is lost to living memory.\nThe three of us walked the long road back from the Eolian. There was a crispness to the air that spoke of winter, but the three of us were young and warmed from the inside by many drinks. A breeze pushed my cloak back and I took a full, happy breath.\nThen a sudden panic seized me. \u201cWhere\u2019s my lute?\u201d I asked more loudly than I\u2019d intended.\n\u201cYou left it with Stanchion at the Eolian,\u201d Wilem said. \u201cHe was afraid you would trip over it and break your neck.\u201d\nSimmon had stopped in the middle of the road. I bumped into him, lost my balance, and tumbled to the ground. He hardly seemed to notice. \u201cWell,\u201d he said seriously. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t feel up to that right now.\u201d\n \nStonebridge rose ahead of us: two hundred feet from end to end, with a high arch that peaked five stories above the river. It was part of the Great Stone Road, straight as a nail, flat as a table, and older than God. I knew it weighed more than a mountain. I knew it had a three-foot parapet running along both its edges.\nDespite all this knowing, I felt deeply uneasy at the thought of trying to cross it. I climbed unsteadily to my feet.\nAs the three of us examined the bridge, Wilem began to lean slowly to one side. I reached out to steady him and at the same time Simmon laid hold of my arm, though whether to help me or to brace himself I couldn\u2019t be certain.\n\u201cI certainly don\u2019t feel up to that right now,\u201d Simmon repeated.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a place to sit over here,\u201dWilem said. \u201cKella trelle turen navor ka.\u201d\nSimmon and I muffled our laughter, and Wilem led us through the trees to a little clearing not fifty feet from the foot of the bridge. To my surprise a tall greystone stood at the middle of it, pointing skyward.\nWil entered the clearing with calm familiarity. I came more slowly, looking about curiously. Greystones are special to troupers, and seeing it gave rise to mixed feelings.\nSimmon flopped down in the thick grass while Wilem settled his back against the trunk of a leaning birch. I moved to the greystone and touched it with my fingertips. It was warm and familiar.\n\u201cDon\u2019t push at that thing,\u201d Simmon said nervously. \u201cYou\u2019ll tip it over.\u201d\nI laughed. \u201cThis stone has been here for a thousand years, Sim. I don\u2019t think my breathing on it is going to hurt it.\u201d\n\u201cJust come away from it. They\u2019re not good things.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a greystone,\u201d I said, giving it a friendly pat. \u201cThey mark old roads. If anything, we\u2019re safer being next to it. Greystones mark safe places. Everyone knows that.\u201d\nSim shook his head stubbornly. \u201cThey\u2019re pagan relics.\u201d\n\u201cA jot says I\u2019m right,\u201d I taunted.\n\u201cHa!\u201d Still on his back, Sim held up a hand. I stepped over to slap it,\nformalizing our wager.\n\u201cWe can go to the Archives and settle it tomorrow,\u201d Sim said.\nI sat down next to the greystone and had just started to relax when I was\nseized by a sudden panic. \u201cBody of God!\u201d I said. \u201cMy lute!\u201d I tried to jump to my feet and failed, almost managing to knock out my brains against the", "greystone in the process.\nSimmon tried to sit up and calm me, but the sudden motion was too much\nfor him and he fell awkwardly onto his side and began to laugh helplessly. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny!\u201d I shouted.\n\u201cIt\u2019s at the Eolian,\u201d Wilem said. \u201cYou\u2019ve asked about it four times since\nwe left.\u201d\n\u201cNo I haven\u2019t,\u201d I said with more conviction than I really felt. I rubbed my\nhead where I\u2019d knocked it against the greystone.\n\u201cThere is no reason to be ashamed.\u201d Wilem waved a hand dismissively. \u201cIt\nis man\u2019s nature to dwell on what sits close to his heart.\u201d\n\u201cI heard Kilvin got a few in him at the Taps a couple months ago and\nwouldn\u2019t shut up about his new cold-sulfur lamp,\u201d Simmon said.\nWil snorted. \u201cLorren would rattle on about proper shelving behavior.\nGrasp by the spine. Grasp by the spine.\u201d He growled and made clutching motions with both hands. \u201cIf I hear him say it again I will grasp his spine.\u201d\nA flash of memory came to me. \u201cMerciful Tehlu,\u201d I said, suddenly aghast. \u201cDid I sing \u2018Tinker Tanner\u2019 at the Eolian tonight?\u201d\n\u201cYou did,\u201d Simmon said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it had so many verses.\u201d\nI wrinkled my forehead, trying desperately to remember. \u201cDid I sing the verse about the Tehlin and the sheep?\u201d It was not a good verse for polite company.\n\u201cNia,\u201d Wilem said.\n\u201cThank God,\u201d I said.\n\u201cIt was a goat,\u201d Wilem managed seriously before he bubbled up into\nlaughter.\n\u201c\u2018. . . in the Tehlin\u2019s cassock!\u2019 \u201d Simmon sang, then joined Wilem in\nlaughter.\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d I said miserably, resting my head in my hands. \u201cMy mother used\nto make my dad sleep under the wagon when he sang that in public. Stanchion will beat me with a stick and take away my pipes next time I see him.\u201d\n\u201cThey loved it,\u201d Simmon reassured me.\n\u201cI saw Stanchion singing along,\u201d Wilem added. \u201cHis nose was a little red by that time too.\u201d\nThere was a long piece of comfortable quiet. \u201cKvothe?\u201d Simmon asked.\n\u201cYes?\u201d", "\u201cAre you really Edema Ruh?\u201d\nThe question caught me unprepared. Normally it would have set me on edge, but at the moment I didn\u2019t know how I felt about it. \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I was just wondering.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d I continued to watch the stars for a while. \u201cWondering what?\u201d \u201cNothing in particular,\u201d he said. \u201cAmbrose called you Ruh a couple times,\nbut he\u2019s called you other insulting things before.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an insult,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI mean he\u2019s called you things that weren\u2019t true,\u201d Sim said quickly. \u201cYou\ndon\u2019t talk about your family, but you\u2019ve said things that made me wonder.\u201d He shrugged, still flat on his back, looking up at the stars. \u201cI\u2019ve never known one of the Edema. Not well, anyway.\u201d\n\u201cWhat you hear isn\u2019t true,\u201d I said. \u201cWe don\u2019t steal children, or worship dark Gods or anything like that.\u201d\n\u201cI never believed any of that,\u201d he said dismissively, then added. \u201cBut some of the things they say must be true. I\u2019ve never heard anyone play like you.\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t have anything to do with my being Edema Ruh,\u201d I said, then reconsidered. \u201cMaybe a little.\u201d\n\u201cDo you dance?\u201d Wilem asked, seemingly out of the blue.\nIf the comment had come from anyone else, or at a different time, it probably would have started a fight. \u201cThat\u2019s just how people picture us. Playing pipes and fiddles. Dancing around our campfires. When we aren\u2019t stealing everything that isn\u2019t nailed down, of course.\u201d A little bitterness crept into my tone when I said the last. \u201cThat\u2019s not what being Edema Ruh is about.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it about?\u201d Simmon asked.\nI thought about it for a moment, but my sodden wit wasn\u2019t up to the task. \u201cWe\u2019re just people really,\u201d I said eventually. \u201cExcept we don\u2019t stay in one place very long, and everyone hates us.\u201d\nThe three of us watched the stars quietly.\n\u201cDid she really make him sleep under the wagon?\u201d Simmon asked. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou said your mom made your dad sleep under the wagon for singing the\nverse about the sheep. Did she really?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s mostly a figure of speech,\u201d I said. \u201cBut once she really did.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t often think of my early life in my troupe, back when my parents\nwere alive. I avoided the subject the same way a cripple learns to keep the", "weight off an injured leg. But Sim\u2019s question brought a memory bubbling to the surface of my mind.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t for singing \u2018Tinker Tanner,\u2019\u201d I found myself saying. \u201cIt was a song he\u2019d written about her. . . .\u201d\nI was quiet for a long moment. Then I said it. \u201cLaurian.\u201d\nIt was the first time I\u2019d said my mother\u2019s name in years. The first time since she\u2019d been killed. It felt strange in my mouth.\nThen, without really meaning to, I began to sing.\nDark Laurian, Arliden\u2019s wife,\nHas a face like the blade of a knife\nHas a voice like a pricklebrown burr But can tally a sum like a moneylender. My sweet Tally cannot cook.\nBut she keeps a tidy ledger-book\nFor all her faults, I do confess\nIt\u2019s worth my life\nTo make my wife\nNot tally a lot less . . .\nI felt oddly numb, disconnected from my own body. Strangely, while the memory was sharp, it wasn\u2019t painful.\n\u201cI can see how that might earn a man a place under the wagon,\u201d Wilem said gravely.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that,\u201d I heard myself saying. \u201cShe was beautiful, and they both knew it. They used to tease each other all the time. It was the meter. She hated the awful meter.\u201d\nI never talked about my parents, and referring to them in the past tense felt uncomfortable. Disloyal. Wil and Sim weren\u2019t surprised by my revelation. Anyone who knew me could tell I had no family. I\u2019d never said anything, but they were good friends. They knew.\n\u201cIn Atur we sleep in the kennels when our wives are angry,\u201d Simmon said, nudging the conversation back into safer territory.\n\u201cMelosi rehu eda Stiti,\u201d Wilem muttered.\n\u201cAturan!\u201d Simmon shouted, his voice bubbling with amusement. \u201cNo more of your donkey talk!\u201d\n\u201cEda Stiti?\u201d I repeated. \u201cYou sleep next to fire?\u201d", "Wilem nodded.\n\u201cI am officially protesting how quickly you picked up Siaru,\u201d Sim said, holding up a finger. \u201cI studied a year before I was any good. A year! You gobble it up in a single term.\u201d\n\u201cI learned a lot growing up,\u201d I said. \u201cI was just getting the fine points this term.\u201d\n\u201cYour accent is better,\u201d Wil said to Sim. \u201cKvothe sounds like some southern trader. Very low. You sound much more refined.\u201d\nSim seemed mollified by that. \u201cNext to the fire,\u201d he repeated. \u201cDoes it seem odd that it\u2019s the men that always have to do their sleeping somewhere else?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious women control the bed,\u201d I said.\n\u201cNot an unpleasant thought,\u201d Sim said. \u201cDepending on the woman.\u201d \u201cDistrel is pretty,\u201d Sim said.\n\u201cKeh,\u201d Wil said. \u201cToo pale. Fela.\u201d\nSimmon shook his head mournfully. \u201cOut of our league.\u201d\n\u201cShe is Modegan,\u201d Wilem said, his grin so wide it was almost demonic. \u201cShe is?\u201d Sim asked. Wil nodded, wearing the widest smile I\u2019d ever seen\non his face. Sim sighed wretchedly. \u201cIt figures. Bad enough that she\u2019s the prettiest girl in the Commonwealth, I didn\u2019t know she was Modegan, too.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll grant you prettiest girl on her side of the river,\u201d I corrected. \u201cOn this side, there\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already gone on about your Denna,\u201d Wil interrupted. \u201cFive times.\u201d\n\u201cListen,\u201d Simmon said, his tone suddenly serious. \u201cYou just have to make your move. This Denna girl is obviously interested in you.\u201d\n\u201cShe hasn\u2019t said anything along those lines.\u201d\n\u201cThey never say they\u2019re interested.\u201d Simmon laughed at the absurdity of it. \u201cThere are little games. It\u2019s like a dance.\u201d He held up two hands, making them talk to each other. \u201c\u2018Oh, fancy meeting you here.\u2019 \u2018Why hello, I was just going to lunch.\u2019 \u2018What a happy coincidence, so was I. Can I carry your books?\u2019 \u201d\nI held up a hand to stop him. \u201cCan we skip to the end of this puppet show, where you end up sobbing into your beer for a span of days?\u201d\nSimmon scowled at me. Wilem laughed.\n\u201cShe has enough men fawning over her,\u201d I said. \u201cThey come and go like . . .\u201d I strained to think of an analogy and failed. \u201cI\u2019d rather be her friend.\u201d", "\u201cYou would rather be close to her heart,\u201d Wilem said without any particular inflection. \u201cYou would rather be joyfully held in the circle of her arms. But you fear she will reject you. You fear she would laugh and you would look the fool.\u201d Wilem shrugged easily. \u201cYou are hardly the first to feel this way. There is no shame in it.\u201d\nThat struck uncomfortably close to the mark, and for a long moment I couldn\u2019t think of anything to say in reply. \u201cI hope,\u201d I admitted quietly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to assume. I\u2019ve seen what happens to the men that assume too much and cling to her.\u201d\nWilem nodded solemnly.\n\u201cShe bought you that lute case,\u201d Sim said helpfully. \u201cThat has to mean something.\u201d\n\u201cBut what does it mean?\u201d I said. \u201cIt seems like she\u2019s interested, but what if it\u2019s just wishful thinking on my part? All those other men must think she\u2019s interested too. But they\u2019re obviously wrong. What if I\u2019m wrong too?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never know unless you try,\u201d Sim said, with a bitter edge to his voice. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019d normally say. But, you know what? It doesn\u2019t work worth a damn. I chase them and they kick at me like I\u2019m a dog at the dinner table. I\u2019m tired of trying so hard.\u201d He gave a weary sigh, still flat on his back. \u201cAll I want is someone who likes me.\u201d\n\u201cAll I want is a clear sign,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI want a magical horse that fits in my pocket,\u201d Wil said. \u201cAnd a ring of red amber that gives me power over demons. And an endless supply of cake.\u201d\nThere was another moment of comfortable quiet. The wind brushed gently through the trees.\n\u201cThey say the Ruh know all the stories in the world,\u201d Simmon said after a while.\n\u201cProbably true,\u201d I admitted.\n\u201cTell one,\u201d he said.\nI eyed him narrowly.\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that,\u201d he protested. \u201cI\u2019m in the mood for a story,\nthat\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cWe are somewhat lacking for entertainment,\u201d Wilem said.\n\u201cFine, fine. Let me think.\u201d I closed my eyes and a story with Amyr in it\nbubbled to the surface. Hardly surprising. They had been on my mind constantly since Nina had found me.\nI sat up straight. \u201cAll right,\u201d I took a breath, then paused. \u201cIf either of you", "have to go piss, do it now. I don\u2019t like having to stop halfway through.\u201d Silence.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cThere is a place not many folk have seen. A strange place called Faeriniel. If you believe the stories, there are two things that make Faeriniel unique. First, it is where all the roads in the world meet. Second, it is not a place any man has ever found by searching. It is not a place you travel to, it is the place you pass through while on your way to somewhere else.\n\u201cThey say that anyone who travels long enough will come there. This is a story of that place, and of an old man on a long road, and of a long and lonely night without a moon. . . .\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN": ["CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN\nA Piece of Fire\nFAERINIEL WAS A GREAT crossroads, but there was no inn where the roads met. Instead there were clearings in the trees where travelers would set their camps and pass the night.\nOnce, years ago and miles away, five groups of travelers came to Faeriniel. They chose their clearings and lit their fires as the sun began to set, pausing on their way from here to there.\nLater, after the sun had set and night was settled firmly in the sky, an old beggar in a tattered robe came walking down the road. He moved with slow care, leaning on a walking stick.\nThe old man was going from nowhere to nowhere. He had no hat for his head and no pack for his back. He had not a penny or a purse to put it in. He barely even owned his own name, and even that had been worn thin and threadbare through the years.\nIf you\u2019d asked him who he was, he would have said, \u201cNobody.\u201d But he would have been wrong.\nThe old man made his way into Faeriniel. He was hungry as a dry fire and weary to his bones. All that kept him moving was the hope that someone might give him a bit of dinner and a piece of their fire.\nSo when the old man saw firelight flickering, he left the road and made his weary way toward it. Soon he saw four tall horses through the trees. Silver was worked into their harness and silver was mixed with the iron of their shoes. Nearby the beggar saw a dozen mules laden with goods: woolen cloth, cunning jewelry, and fine steel blades.\nBut what caught the beggar\u2019s attention was the side of meat above the fire, steaming and dripping fat onto the coals. He almost fainted at the sweet smell of it, for he had been walking all day with nothing to eat but a handful of acorns and a bruised apple he\u2019d found by the side of the road.\nStepping into the clearing, the old beggar called out to the three dark- bearded men who sat around the fire. \u201cHalloo,\u201d he said. \u201cCan you spare a bit", "of meat and a piece of your fire?\u201d\nThey turned, their gold chains glittering in the firelight. \u201cCertainly,\u201d their\nleader said. \u201cWhat do you have with you? Bits or pennies? Rings or strehlaum? Or do you have the true-ringing Cealdish coin we prize above all others?\u201d\n\u201cI have none of these,\u201d the old beggar said, opening his hands to show they were empty.\n\u201cThen you will find no comfort here,\u201d they said, and as he watched they began to carve thick pieces from the haunch that hung by the fire.\n\u201cNo offense, Wilem. It\u2019s just how the story goes.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d\n\u201cYou looked like you were going to.\u201d\n\u201cI may. But it will wait until after.\u201d\nThe old man walked on, following the light of another fire through the trees.\n\u201cHalloo!\u201d the old beggar called out as he stepped into the second clearing. He tried to sound cheerful, though he was weary and sore. \u201cCan you spare a bit of meat and a piece of your fire?\u201d\nThere were four travelers there, two men and two women. At the sound of his voice they rose to their feet, but none of them spoke. The old man waited politely, trying to appear pleasant and harmless. But the quiet stretched on, long as long, and still no word was spoken.\nUnderstandably, the old man grew irritated. He was used to being shunned or shrugged aside, but these folk merely stood. They were quiet and restless, moving from foot to foot while their hands twitched nervously.\nJust as he was about to sulk away, the fire flared and the beggar saw the four wore the blood-red clothes that marked them as Adem mercenaries. Then the old man understood. The Adem are called the silent folk, and they speak only rarely.\nThe old man knew many stories of the Adem. He\u2019d heard that they possessed a secret craft called the Lethani. This let them wear their quiet like an armor that would turn a blade or stop an arrow in the air. This is why they seldom spoke. They saved their words, keeping them inside like coals in the belly of a furnace.\nThose hoarded words filled them with so much restless energy that they could never be completely still, which is why they were always twitching and fidgeting about. Then when they fought, they used their secret craft to burn", "those words like fuel inside themselves. This made them strong as bears and fast as snakes.\nWhen the beggar first heard these rumors, he thought them silly campfire stories. But years ago in Modeg, he had seen an Adem woman fight the city guard. The soldiers were armed and armored, thick of arm and chest. They had demanded to see the woman\u2019s sword in the king\u2019s name, and though hesitant, she presented it to them. As soon as they held it in their hands, they had leered and pawed at her, making lewd suggestions about what she could do to get it back.\nThey were tall men with bright armor and their swords were sharp. They fell like autumn wheat before her. She killed three of them, breaking their bones with her hands.\nHer own wounds were minor by comparison, a dark bruise along one cheek, a slight limp, a shallow cut across one hand. Even after all the long years, the old man remembered the way she had licked the blood from the back of her hand like a cat.\nThis is what the old beggar thought of when he saw the Adem standing there. All thought of food and fire left him, and he backed slowly into the shelter of the surrounding trees.\nThen he set off toward the next fire, hoping third time would prove lucky.\nAt this clearing were a number of Aturans standing around a dead donkey lying near a cart. One of them spotted the old man. \u201cLook!\u201d he pointed. \u201cGrab him! We\u2019ll hitch him to the cart and make him pull!\u201d\nThe old man darted back into the trees, and after running to and fro, he lost the Aturans by hiding under a pile of moldering leaves.\nWhen the sound of the Aturans faded, the old man dragged himself from the leaves and found his walking stick. Then, with the courage of one who is poor and hungry, he set off to the fourth fire he saw in the distance.\nThere he might have found what he was looking for, because around the fire were traders from Vintas. Had things been different they might have welcomed him to dinner, saying, \u201cWhere six can eat, seven can eat.\u201d\nBut by this point the old man was quite a sight. His hair stuck from his head in wild disarray. His robe, ragged before, was now torn and dirty. His face was pale from fright, and his breathing groaned and wheezed in his chest.\nBecause of this, the Vints gasped and made gestures before their faces. They thought he was a barrow draug, you see, one of the unquiet dead that", "superstitious Vints believe walk the night.\nEach of the Vints had a different thought as to how they could stop him.\nSome thought fire would frighten him off, some thought salt scattered on the grass would keep him away, some thought iron would cut the strings that held the soul to his dead body.\nListening to them argue, the old beggar realized that no matter what they agreed on, he would not be the better for it. So he hurried back to the sheltering trees.\nThe old man found a rock to sit on and brushed the dead leaves and dirt away as best he could. After sitting for a while he thought to try one final campsite, knowing it would only take one generous traveler to fill his belly.\nHe was pleased to see a lone man sitting at the final fire. Coming closer, he saw a thing that left him both delighted and afraid, for though the beggar had lived many years, he had never before spoken to one of the Amyr.\nStill, he knew the Amyr were a part of Tehlu\u2019s church, and\u2014\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t part of the church,\u201d Wilem said.\n\u201cWhat? Of course they were.\u201d\n\u201cNo, they were of the Aturan bureaucracy. They had . . . Vecarum\u2014\njudiciary powers.\u201d\n\u201cThey were called the Holy Order of Amyr. They were the strong right\nhand of the church.\u201d\n\u201cBet a jot?\u201d\n\u201cFine. If it will keep you quiet through the rest of the story.\u201d\nThe old beggar was delighted, for he knew the Amyr were a part of\nTehlu\u2019s church, and the church was sometimes generous to the poor.\nThe Amyr came to his feet as the old man approached. \u201cWho goes there?\u201d\nhe asked. His voice was proud and powerful, but also tired. \u201cKnow I am of the Order Amyr. None should come between me and my tasks. I will act for the good of all, though Gods and men might bar my way.\u201d\n\u201cSir,\u201d the beggar said, \u201cI\u2019m just hoping for a piece of fire and some charity on a long road.\u201d\nThe Amyr gestured the old man forward. He was armored in a suit of bright steel rings, and his sword was tall as a man. His tabard was of shining white, but from the elbows the color darkened into crimson, as if dipped in blood. In the center of his chest, he wore the symbol of the Amyr: the black tower wrapped in a crimson flame.\nThe old man sat near the fire and gave a sigh as the heat soaked into his", "bones.\nAfter a moment, the Amyr spoke, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can offer you nothing to\neat. My horse eats better than I do tonight, but that does not mean that he eats well.\u201d\n\u201cAnything would be a lovely help,\u201d the old man said. \u201cScraps are more than what I have. I am not proud.\u201d\nThe Amyr sighed. \u201cTomorrow I must ride fifty miles to stop a trial. If I fail or falter, an innocent woman will die. This is all I have.\u201d The Amyr gestured to a piece of cloth with a crust of bread and a sliver of cheese. Both of them together would hardly be enough to dent the old man\u2019s hunger. It made a poor dinner for a man as large as the Amyr.\n\u201cTomorrow I must ride and fight,\u201d the armored man said. \u201cI need my strength. So I must weigh your night of hunger against this woman\u2019s life.\u201d As he spoke, the Amyr raised his hands and held them palms up, like the plates of a balancing scale.\nWhen he made this motion, the old beggar saw the backs of the Amyr\u2019s hands, and for a second he thought the Amyr had cut himself, and that blood was running between his fingers and down his arms. Then the fire shifted and the beggar saw it was only a tattoo, though he still shivered at the bloody markings on the Amyr\u2019s hands and arms.\nHe would have done more than shiver had he known all that those markings meant. They showed the Amyr was trusted so completely by the Order that his actions would never be questioned. And as the Order stood behind him, no church, no court, no king could move against him. For he was one of the Ciridae, highest of the Amyr.\nIf he killed an unarmed man, it was not murder in the Order\u2019s eyes. If he strangled a pregnant woman in the middle of the street, none would speak against him. Should he burn a church or break an old stone bridge, the empire held him blameless, trusting all he did was in the service of the greater good.\nBut the beggar knew none of this, and so he tried again. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have any food to spare, could I have a penny or two?\u201d He thought of the Cealdish camp, and how he might buy a slice of meat or bread.\nThe Amyr shook his head. \u201cIf I did, I would gladly give it. But three days ago I gave the last of my money to a new widower with a hungry child. I have been penniless as you are ever since.\u201d He shook his head, his expression weary and full of regret. \u201cI wish circumstances were different. But I now must sleep, so you must go.\u201d", "The old man was hardly happy about this, but there was something in the Amyr\u2019s voice that made him wary. So he creaked back onto his feet and left the fire behind.\nBefore the warmth of the Amyr\u2019s fire could leave him, the old man tightened his belt and made up his mind to simply walk through \u2019til morning. Hoping the end of his road might bring him better luck, or at least a meeting with some kinder folk.\nSo he walked through the center of Faeriniel, and as he did, he saw a circle of great grey stones. Inside that circle was the faint glow of firelight hidden in a well-dug pit. The old man noticed he couldn\u2019t smell a wisp of smoke either, and realized these folk were burning rennel wood, which burns hot and hard, but doesn\u2019t smoke or stink.\nThen the old man saw that two of the great shapes were not stones at all. They were wagons. A handful of people huddled round a cookpot in the dim light of the fire.\nBut the old man didn\u2019t have a shred of hope left, so he kept walking. He was almost past the stones when a voice called out: \u201cHo there! Who are you, and why do you pass by so quietly at night?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m nobody,\u201d the old man said. \u201cJust an old beggar, following my road until its end.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you out walking instead of settling down to sleep? These roads are not all safe at night,\u201d the voice replied.\n\u201cI have no bed,\u201d the old man said. \u201cAnd tonight I cannot beg or borrow one for all the world.\u201d\n\u201cThere is one here for you, if you would like it. And a bit of dinner if you\u2019ve a mind to share. No one should walk all day and night besides.\u201d A handsome, bearded man stepped from the concealment of the tall grey stones. He took the old man\u2019s elbow and led him toward the fire, calling ahead, \u201cWe have a guest tonight!\u201d\nThere was a small stir of motion ahead of them, but the night was moonless and their fire was deep in a concealing pit, so the beggar couldn\u2019t see much of what was being done. Curious, he asked, \u201cWhy do you hide your fire?\u201d\nHis host sighed. \u201cNot all folk are filled with love for us. We\u2019re safest by being out of harm\u2019s way. Besides, our fire is small tonight.\u201d\n\u201cWhy is that?\u201d the beggar asked. \u201cWith so many trees, wood should be easy to come by.\u201d", "\u201cWe went gathering earlier,\u201d the bearded man explained. \u201cBut folk called us thieves and shot arrows at us.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cSo we make do, and tomorrow will take care of itself.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cBut I am talking too much. May I offer you a drink, father?\u201d\n\u201cA bit of water, if you can spare it.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense, you will have wine.\u201d\nIt had been a long time since the beggar had tasted wine, and the thought\nof it was enough to set his mouth all a-watering. But he knew wine was not the best thing for an empty stomach that had walked all day, so he said, \u201cYou are kind, bless you. But water is good enough for me.\u201d\nThe man at his elbow smiled. \u201cThen have water and wine, each to your desire.\u201d And saying so he brought the beggar to their water barrel.\nThe old beggar bent and drew up a ladle of water. When it touched his lips it was cool and sweet, but as he drew up the ladle, he couldn\u2019t help but notice the barrel was very nearly empty.\nIn spite of this, his host urged him, \u201cTake another and wash the dust from your hands and face. I can tell you\u2019ve been on the road for a long and weary while.\u201d So the old beggar took a second dipper of water, and once his hands and face were clean, he felt much refreshed.\nThen his host took his elbow again and led him to the fire. \u201cWhat is your name, father?\u201d\nAgain the beggar was surprised. It had been years since anyone had cared enough to ask his name. It had been so long he had to stop and think about it for a moment. \u201cSceop,\u201d he said at last. \u201cI am called Sceop, and you?\u201d\n\u201cMy name is Terris,\u201d his host said as he made the old man comfortable close to the fire. \u201cThis is Silla, my wife, and Wint, our son. This is Shari and Benthum and Lil and Peter and Fent.\u201d\nThen Terris brought Sceop wine. Silla gave him a heavy ladle of potato soup, a slice of warm bread, and half a golden summer squash with sweet butter in the bowl of it. It was plain, and there was not a lot, but to Sceop it seemed a feast. And as he ate, Wint kept his cup full of wine, and smiled at him, and sat by his knee and called him grandfather.\nThe last was too much for the old beggar, and he began to cry softly. Perhaps it was that he was old, and his day had been a long one. Perhaps it was that he was not used to kindness. Perhaps it was the wine. Whatever the reason, tears began to trickle down his face and lose themselves in his deep white beard.", "Terris saw this and was quick to ask, \u201cFather, whatever is the matter?\u201d\n\u201cI am a silly old man,\u201d Sceop said, more to himself than to the rest of them. \u201cYou have been kinder to me than anyone in years, and I am sorry I cannot repay you.\u201d\nTerris smiled and laid a hand on the old man\u2019s back. \u201cWould you really like to pay?\u201d\n\u201cI cannot. I have nothing to give you.\u201d\nTerris\u2019s smile widened. \u201cSceop. We are the Edema Ruh. The thing we value most is something everyone possesses.\u201d One by one, Sceop saw the faces around the fire look up at him expectantly. Terris said, \u201cYou could tell us your story.\u201d\nNot knowing what else to do, Sceop began to speak. He told how he had come to Faeriniel. How he had walked from one fire to the next, hoping for charity. At first his voice faltered and his story stumbled, for he had been alone a long time and was not used to talking. But soon his voice became stronger, his words bolder, and as the fire flickered and reflected in his bright blue eyes, his hands danced along with his old dried voice. Even the Edema Ruh, who know all the stories in the world, could do nothing but listen in wonder.\nWhen his story came to an end the troupers stirred as if waking from a deep sleep. For a moment they did nothing but look at each other, then they looked at Sceop.\nTerris knew what they were thinking. \u201cSceop,\u201d he asked gently. \u201cWhere were you headed, when I stopped you tonight?\u201d\n\u201cI was going to Tinu\u00eb,\u201d said Sceop, who was a little embarrassed at how caught up in the story he had become. His face was hot and red, and he felt foolish.\n\u201cWe are bound for Belenay ourselves,\u201d Terris said. \u201cWould you consider coming with us instead?\u201d\nFor a moment Sceop\u2019s face lit with hope, but then it fell. \u201cI would be nothing but a burden. Even a beggar has his pride.\u201d\nTerris laughed. \u201cYou would tell the Edema about pride? We do not ask you out of pity. We ask because you belong in our family, and we would have you tell us a dozen dozen stories in the years to come.\u201d\nThe beggar shook his head. \u201cMy blood is not yours. I am not a part of your family.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does that have to do with the price of butter?\u201d Terris asked. \u201cWe", "Ruh decide who is a part of our family and who is not. You belong with us. Look around and see if I am lying.\u201d\nSceop looked up at the circle of faces and saw what Terris said was true.\nAnd so the old man stayed, and lived with them for many years before they parted ways. Many things he saw, and many stories he told, and everyone was wiser in the end because of it.\nThis thing happened, though it was years and miles away. I have heard it from the mouths of the Edema Ruh, and thus I know it to be true.", ""], "CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT": ["CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT\nKernels of Truth\n\u201cIS THAT THE END?\u201d Simmon asked after a polite pause. He was on his back, looking up at the stars.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t end the way I thought it would,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d\n\u201cI was waiting to find out who the beggar really was. I thought as soon as\nsomeone was nice to him, he would turn out to be Taborlin the Great. Then he would give them his walking stick and a sack of money and . . .I don\u2019t know. Make something magical happen.\u201d\nWilem spoke up. \u201cHe\u2019d say, \u2018Whenever you are in danger knock this stick on the ground and say \u201cstick be quick,\u201d \u2019 and then the stick would whirl around and defend them from whoever was attacking them.\u201d Wilem was lying on his back in the tall grass, too. \u201cI didn\u2019t think he was really an old beggar.\u201d\n\u201cOld beggars in stories are never really old beggars,\u201d Simmon said with hint of accusation in his voice. \u201cThey\u2019re always a witch or a prince or an angel or something.\u201d\n\u201cIn real life old beggars are almost always old beggars,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cBut I know what kind of story you two are thinking about. Those are stories we tell other people to entertain them. This story is different. It\u2019s one we tell each other.\u201d\n\u201cWhy tell a story if it\u2019s not entertaining?\u201d\n\u201cTo help us remember. To teach us\u2014\u201d I made a vague gesture. \u201cThings.\u201d \u201cLike exaggerated stereotypes?\u201d Simmon asked.\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d I asked, nettled.\n\u201c \u2018Tie him to the wagon and make him pull\u2019?\u201d Simmon made a disgusted\nnoise. \u201cI\u2019d be offended if I didn\u2019t know you.\u201d\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t know you,\u201d I said hotly,\u201cI\u2019d be offended. Do you know Aturans\nused to kill people if they found them living on the road? One of your", "emperors declared them to be detrimental to the empire. Most were little more than beggars who had lost their homes because of the wars and taxes. Most were simply press-ganged into military service.\u201d\nI tugged at the front of my shirt. \u201cBut the Edema were especially prized. They hunted us like foxes. For a hundred years Ruh-hunt was a favorite pastime among the Aturan upper crust.\u201d\nA profound silence fell. My throat hurt, and I realized I\u2019d been shouting. Simmon\u2019s voice was muffled. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d\nI kicked myself mentally and sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Simmon. It\u2019s a . . . It was\na long time ago. And it\u2019s not your fault. It\u2019s an old story.\u201d\n\u201cIt would have to be, to have a reference to the Amyr,\u201d Wilem said,\nobviously trying to change the subject. \u201cThey disbanded what? Three hundred years ago?\u201d\n\u201cStill,\u201d I said. \u201cThere\u2019s some truth in most stereotypes. A seed they sprouted from.\u201d\n\u201cBasil is from Vintas,\u201d Wil said. \u201cAnd he is odd about certain things. Sleeps with a penny underneath his pillow, that sort of thing.\u201d\n\u201cOn my way to the University I traveled with a pair of Adem mercenaries,\u201d Simmon said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t talk to anyone except each other. And they were restless and fidgety.\u201d\nWilem spoke hesitantly. \u201cI will admit to knowing many Cealdim who take great care to line their boots with silver.\u201d\n\u201cPurses,\u201d Simmon corrected him. \u201cBoots are for putting your feet in.\u201d He wiggled a foot to illustrate.\n\u201cI know what a boot is,\u201d Wilem said crossly. \u201cI speak this vulgar language better than you do. Boot is what we say, Patu. Money in your purse is for spending. Money you plan to keep is in your boot.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Simmon said thoughtfully. \u201cI see. Like saving it for a rainy day, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you do with money when it rains?\u201d Wilem asked, genuinely puzzled.\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s more to the story than you think,\u201d I interjected quickly before things digressed any further. \u201cThe story holds a kernel of truth. If you promise to keep it to yourselves, I will tell you a secret.\u201d\nI felt their attention sharpen onto me. \u201cIf you ever accept the hospitality of a traveling troupe, and they offer you wine before anything else, they are Edema Ruh. That part of the story is true.\u201d I held up a finger to caution them.", "\u201cBut don\u2019t take the wine.\u201d\n\u201cBut I like wine,\u201d Simmon said piteously.\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d I said. \u201cYour host offers you wine, but you insist on\nwater. It might even turn into a competition of sorts, the host offering more and more grandly, the guest refusing more and more politely. When you do this, they will know you are a friend of the Edema, that you know our ways. They will treat you like family for the night, as opposed to being a mere guest.\u201d\nThe conversation lulled as they absorbed this piece of information. I looked up at the stars, tracing the familiar constellations in my head. Ewan the hunter, the crucible, the young-again mother, the fire-tongued fox, the broken tower. . . .\n\u201cWhere would you go if you could go anywhere?\u201d Simmon\u2019s question came out of the blue.\n\u201cAcross the river,\u201d I said. \u201cBed.\u201d\n\u201cNo no,\u201d he protested, \u201cI mean if you could go anywhere in the world.\u201d \u201cSame answer,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a lot of places. This is where I\u2019ve always\nwanted to go.\u201d\n\u201cBut not forever,\u201d Wilem said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be here forever, do\nyou?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I meant,\u201d Simmon added. \u201cWe all want to be here. But none\nof us want to be here forever.\u201d\n\u201cExcept Manet,\u201d Wil said.\n\u201cWhere would you go?\u201d Simmon pursued his point doggedly. \u201cFor\nadventure?\u201d\nI thought for a moment, quietly. \u201cI guess I\u2019d to go to the Tahlenwald,\u201d I\nsaid.\n\u201cAmong the Tahl?\u201d Wilem asked. \u201cThey\u2019re a primitive nomadic people,\nfrom what I\u2019ve heard.\u201d\n\u201cTechnically speaking, the Edema Ruh are a nomadic people,\u201d I said dryly.\n\u201cI heard a story once that said the leaders of their tribes aren\u2019t great warriors, they\u2019re singers. Their songs can heal the sick and make the trees dance.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cI\u2019d go there and find out if it was true.\u201d\n\u201cI would go to the Faen Court,\u201d Wilem said.\nSimmon laughed. \u201cYou can\u2019t pick that.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Wilem said with a quick anger. \u201cIf Kvothe can go to a singing\ntree, I can go into Faen and dance with Embrula . . . with Faen women.\u201d", "\u201cThe Tahl is real,\u201d Simmon protested. \u201cFaerie stories are for drunks, halfwits, and children.\u201d\n\u201cWhere would you go?\u201d I asked Simmon to keep him from antagonizing Wilem.\nThere was a long pause. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, his voice oddly empty of any inflection. \u201cI haven\u2019t been anywhere, really. I only came to the University because after my brothers inherit and my sister gets her dowry there isn\u2019t going to be much for me except the family name.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t want to come here?\u201d I asked, disbelief coloring my voice.\nSim made a noncommittal shrug, and I was about to ask him something else when I was interrupted by the sound of Wilem getting noisily to his feet. \u201cAre we feeling up to the bridge now?\u201d\nMy head felt remarkably clear. I got to my feet with only a slight wobble. \u201cFine by me.\u201d\n\u201cJust a second.\u201d Simmon started to undo his pants as he moved toward the trees.\nAs soon as he was out of sight, Wilem leaned close to me. \u201cDon\u2019t ask about his family,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cIt is not easy for him to speak about. Worse when he is drunk.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d\nHe made a sharp motion with his hand, shaking his head. \u201cLater.\u201d Simmon bumbled back into the clearing, and the three of us made our\nsilent way back to the road, then over Stonebridge and into the University.", ""], "CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE": ["CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE\nContradictions\nLATE NEXT MORNING, WIL and I made our way to the Archives to meet up with Sim and settle our bets of the night before.\n\u201cThe problem is his father,\u201d Wilem explained in low tones as we made our way between the grey buildings. \u201cSim\u2019s father holds a duchy in Atur. Good land, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHold on,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cOur little Sim\u2019s father is a duke?\u201d\n\u201cLittle Sim,\u201d Wilem said dryly, \u201cis three years older than you and two inches taller.\u201d\n\u201cWhich duchy?\u201d I asked. \u201cAnd he\u2019s not that much taller.\u201d\n\u201cDalonir,\u201d Wilem said. \u201cBut you know how it is. Noble blood from Atur. Small wonder he does not speak of it.\u201d\n\u201cOh come on,\u201d I chided, gesturing to the students filling the street around us. \u201cThe University has the most open-minded atmosphere since the church burned Caluptena to the ground.\u201d\n\u201cI notice you do not make any loud announcement that you\u2019re Edema Ruh.\u201d\nI bristled. \u201cAre you implying I\u2019m embarrassed?\u201d\n\u201cI am saying you make no loud announcement,\u201d Wil said calmly, giving me a steady look. \u201cNeither does Simmon. I imagine you both have your reasons.\u201d\nPushing down my irritation, I nodded.\nWilem continued. \u201cDalonir is in the north of Aturna, so they are reasonably well off. But he has three older brothers and two sisters. The first son inherits. The father bought the second a military commission. The third was placed in the church. Simmon . . .\u201d Wilem trailed off suggestively.\n\u201cI have a hard time imagining Sim as a priest,\u201d I admitted. \u201cOr a soldier, come to think of it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd so Sim ends up at the University,\u201d Wilem finished. \u201cHis father was hoping he would become a diplomat. Then Sim discovered he liked alchemy", "and poetry and entered the Arcanum. His father was not entirely pleased.\u201d Wilem gave me a significant look and I gathered he was drastically understating the case.\n\u201cBeing an arcanist is a remarkable thing!\u201d I protested. \u201cMuch more impressive than being a perfumed toady in some court.\u201d\nWilem shrugged. \u201cHis tuition is paid. His allowance continues.\u201d He paused to wave at someone on the other side of the courtyard. \u201cBut Simmon does not go home. Not for even a brief visit. Sim\u2019s father likes to hunt, fight, drink, and wench. I suspect our gentle, bookish Sim was probably not given the love a clever son deserves.\u201d\nWil and I met up with Sim in our usual reading hole and clarified the details of our drunken wagers. Then we went our separate ways.\nAn hour later I returned with a modest armload of books. My search had been made considerably easier by the fact that I\u2019d been researching the Amyr since Nina had arrived and given me her scroll.\nI knocked softly on the door of the reading hole, then let myself in. Wil and Sim were already sitting at the table.\n\u201cMe first,\u201d Simmon said happily. He consulted a list, then pulled a book from his stack. \u201cPage one hundred and fifty two.\u201d He leafed through until he found the page and then began to scan it. \u201cAh-ha! \u2018The girl then gave an account of everything. . . . Blah blah blah . . . And led them to the place where she stumbled onto the pagan frolic.\u2019\u201d He looked up, pointing at the page. \u201cSee? It says pagan right there.\u201d\nI sat down. \u201cLet\u2019s see the rest.\u201d\nSim\u2019s second book was more of the same. But the third held something of a surprise.\n\u201c \u2018A large preponderance of marker stones in the vicinity, suggesting this area might have been crossed with trade routes in some forgotten past. . . .\u2019\u201d He trailed off, then shrugged and handed the book to me. \u201cThis one seems to be on your side.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cDidn\u2019t you read these before you brought them here?\u201d\n\u201cIn an hour?\u201d He gave a laugh of his own. \u201cNot likely, I just used a scriv.\u201d\n \nWilem gave him a dark look. \u201cNo you didn\u2019t. You asked Puppet, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\nSimmon assumed an innocent expression, which on his naturally innocent face only served to make him look profoundly guilty. \u201cI might have stopped in to see him,\u201d he hedged. \u201cAnd he might have happened to suggest a couple books that had information about greystones.\u201d Seeing Wilem\u2019s expression he raised a hand. \u201cDon\u2019t get sniffy on me. It\u2019s backfired anyway.\u201d\n\u201cPuppet again,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cAre you ever going to introduce me? The two of you are so tight-lipped about him.\u201d\nWilem shrugged. \u201cYou will understand when you meet him.\u201d\nSim\u2019s books divided into three categories. One supported his side, telling of pagan rites and animal sacrifices. The other speculated about an ancient civilization that used them as marker stones for roads, despite the fact that some were located on sheer mountainsides or river bottoms where no road could be.\nHis final book was interesting for other reasons:\n\u201c. . . a pair of matched stone monoliths with a third across the top,\u201d Simmon read. \u201cThe locals refer to it as the door-post. While spring and summer pageants involve decorating and dancing around the stone, parents forbid their children from spending time near it when the moon is full. One well-respected and otherwise reasonable old man claimed . . .\u201d\nSim broke off reading. \u201cWhatever,\u201d he said disgustedly and moved to close the book.\n\u201cClaimed what?\u201d Wilem asked, his curiosity piqued.\nSimmon rolled his eyes and continued reading, \u201cClaimed at certain times men could pass through the stone door into the fair land where Felurian herself abides, loving and destroying men with her embrace.\u201d\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d Wilem murmured.\n\u201cNo it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s childish, superstitious bunk,\u201d Simmon said testily. \u201cAnd none of this is getting us any closer to deciding who is right.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you count them, Wilem?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou\u2019re our impartial judge.\u201d\nWilem moved to the table and looked through the books. His dark eyebrows moved up and down as he considered. \u201cSeven for Simmon. Six for Kvothe. Three contrary.\u201d\nWe looked briefly at the four books I had brought. Wilem ruled one of them out, which brought the tally to seven for Simmon and ten for me. \u201cHardly conclusive,\u201d Wilem mused.", "\u201cWe could declare it a draw,\u201d I suggested magnanimously.\nSimmon scowled. Good-natured or not, he hated losing a bet. \u201cFair enough,\u201d he said.\nI turned to Wilem and gave a significant look at the pair of books still untouched on the table \u201cIt looks like our bet will be settled a little more quickly, nia?\u201d\nWilem gave a predatory grin. \u201cVery quickly.\u201d He lifted a book. \u201cHere I have a copy of the proclamation which disbanded the Amyr.\u201d He opened to a marked page and began to read. \u201c\u2018Their actions will henceforth be held in account by the laws of the empire. No member of the Order shall presume to take upon themselves the right to hear a case, nor to pass judgment in court.\u2019 \u201d\nHe looked up smugly. \u201cSee? If they had their adjudicating powers revoked, then they must have had some to begin with. So it stands to reason they were a part of the Aturan bureaucracy.\u201d\n\u201cActually,\u201d I said apologetically, \u201cThe church has always had judiciary powers in Atur.\u201d I held up one of my two books. \u201cIt\u2019s funny you should bring the Alpura Prolycia Amyr. I brought it too. The decree itself was issued by the church.\u201d\nWilem\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cNo it wasn\u2019t. It was listed in here as Emperor Nalto\u2019s sixty-third decree.\u201d\nPuzzled, we compared our two books and found them directly contradictory.\n\u201cWell I guess those cancel each other out,\u201d Sim said. \u201cWhat else have you guys got?\u201d\n\u201cThis is Feltemi Reis. The Lights of History,\u201d Wilem grumbled. \u201cIt is definitive. I didn\u2019t think I would need any further proof.\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t this bother either of you?\u201d I thumped the two contradictory books with a knuckle. \u201cThese shouldn\u2019t be saying different things.\u201d\n\u201cWe just read twenty books saying different things,\u201d Simmon pointed out. \u201cWhy would I have a problem with two more?\u201d\n\u201cThe purpose of the greystones is speculative. There\u2019s bound to be a variety of opinions. But the Alpura Prolycia Amyr was an open decree. It turned thousands of the most powerful men and women in the Aturan Empire into outlaws. It was one of the primary reasons for the collapse of the empire. There\u2019s no reason for conflicting information.\u201d\n\u201cThe order has been disbanded for over three hundred years,\u201d Simmon", "said. \u201cPlenty of time for some contradictions to arise.\u201d\nI shook my head, flipping through both of the books. \u201cContrary opinions\nare one thing. Contrary facts are another.\u201d I held up my book. \u201cThis is The Fall of Empire by Greggor the Lesser. He\u2019s a windbag and a bigot, but he\u2019s the best historian of his age.\u201d I held up Wilem\u2019s book. \u201cFeltemi Reis isn\u2019t nearly the historian, but he\u2019s twice the scholar Greggor was, and scrupulous about his facts.\u201d I looked back and forth between the books, frowning. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\n\u201cSo what now?\u201d Sim said. \u201cAnother draw? That\u2019s disappointing.\u201d\n\u201cWe need someone to judge,\u201d Wilem said. \u201cA higher authority.\u201d \u201cHigher than Feltemi Reis?\u201d I asked. \u201cI doubt Lorren can be bothered to\nsettle our bet.\u201d\nWil shook his head, then stood and brushed the wrinkles from the front of\nhis shirt. \u201cIt means you finally get to meet Puppet.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER FORTY": ["CHAPTER FORTY\nPuppet\n\u201cTHE MOST IMPORTANT THING is to be polite,\u201d Simmon said in a hushed tone as we made our way through a narrow hallway lined with books. Our sympathy lamps shot bands of light through the shelves and made the shadows dance nervously. \u201cBut don\u2019t patronize him. He\u2019s a bit\u2014odd, but he\u2019s not an idiot. Just treat him like you would treat anyone else.\u201d\n\u201cExcept polite,\u201d I said sarcastically, tiring of this litany of advice. \u201cExactly,\u201d Simmon said seriously.\n\u201cWhere are we going, anyway?\u201d I asked, mostly to stop Simmon\u2019s\nhenpecking.\n\u201cSub-three,\u201d Wilem said as he turned to descend a long flight of stone\nsteps. Centuries of use had worn down the stone, making the stairs look as bowed as heavy-laden shelves. As we started down, the shadows made the steps look smooth and dark and edgeless, like an abandoned riverbed worn from the rock.\n\u201cAre you sure he\u2019s going to be there?\u201d\nWil nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t think he leaves his chambers very much.\u201d \u201cChambers?\u201d I asked. \u201cHe lives here?\u201d\nNeither of them said anything as Wilem led the way down another flight of\nstairs, then through a long stretch of wide hallway with a low ceiling. Finally we came to an unremarkable door tucked into a corner. If I hadn\u2019t known better I would have assumed it was one of the countless reading holes scattered throughout the Stacks.\n\u201cJust don\u2019t do anything to upset him,\u201d Simmon said nervously.\nI assumed my most polite expression as Wilem rapped on the door. The handle began to turn almost immediately. The door opened a crack, then was thrown wide. Puppet stood framed in the doorway, taller than any of us. The sleeves of his black robe billowed strikingly in the breeze of the opening door.\nHe stared at us haughtily for a moment, then looked puzzled and brought a", "hand to touch the side of his head. \u201cWait, I\u2019ve forgotten my hood,\u201d he said, and kicked the door closed.\nOdd as his brief appearance had been, I\u2019d noticed something more disturbing. \u201cBurned body of God,\u201d I whispered. \u201cHe\u2019s got candles in there. Does Lorren know?\u201d\nSimmon opened his mouth to answer when the door was thrown wide again. Puppet filled the doorway, his dark robe striking against the warm candlelight behind him. He was hooded now, with his arms upraised. The long sleeves of his robes caught the inrush of air and billowed impressively. The same rush of air caught his hood and blew it partway off his head.\n\u201cDamn,\u201d he said in a distracted voice. The hood settled half on, half off his head, partially covering one eye. He kicked the door shut again.\nWilem and Simmon remained straight-faced. I refrained from any comment.\nThere was a moment of quiet. Finally a muffled voice came from the other side of the door. \u201cWould you mind knocking again? It doesn\u2019t seem quite right otherwise.\u201d\nObediently, Wilem stepped back up to the door and knocked. Once, twice, then the door swung open and we were confronted with a looming figure in a dark robe. His cowled hood shadowed his face, and the long sleeves of his robe stirred in the wind.\n\u201cWho calls on Taborlin the Great?\u201d Puppet intoned, his voice resonant, but slightly muted by the deep hood. A hand pointed dramatically. \u201cYou! Simmon!\u201d There was a pause, and his voice lost its dramatic resonance. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you already today, haven\u2019t I?\u201d\nSimmon nodded. I could sense the laughter tumbling around in him, trying to find a way out.\n\u201cHow long ago?\u201d\n\u201cAbout an hour.\u201d\n\u201cHmm.\u201d The hood nodded. \u201cWas I better this time?\u201d He reached up to\npush the hood back and I noticed the robe was too big for him, the sleeves hanging down to his fingertips. When his face emerged from the hood he was grinning like a child playing dress-up in his parents\u2019 clothes.\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t doing Taborlin before,\u201d Simmon admitted.\n\u201cOh.\u201d Puppet seemed a little put out. \u201cHow was I this time? The last time, I mean. Was it a good Taborlin?\u201d\n\u201cPretty good,\u201d Simmon said.", "Puppet looked at Wilem.\n\u201cI liked the robe,\u201d Wil said. \u201cBut I always imagined Taborlin with a gentle voice.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d He finally looked at me. \u201cHello.\u201d\n\u201cHello,\u201d I said in my politest tone.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know you.\u201d A pause. \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\u201cI am Kvothe.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem so certain of it,\u201d he said, looking at me intently. Another pause.\n\u201cThey call me Puppet.\u201d\n\u201cWho is \u2018they?\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cWho are they?\u201d he corrected, raising a finger.\nI smiled. \u201cWho are they then?\u201d\n\u201cWho were they then?\u201d\n\u201cWho are they now?\u201d I clarified, my smile growing wider.\nPuppet mirrored my smile in a distracted way and made a vague gesture\nwith one hand. \u201cYou know, them. People.\u201d He continued to stare at me the same way I might examine an interesting stone or a type of leaf I\u2019d never seen before.\n\u201cWhat do you call yourself?\u201d I asked.\nHe seemed a little surprised, and his eyes focused onto me in a more ordinary way. \u201cThat would be telling, I suspect,\u201d he said with a touch of reproach. He glanced at the silent Wilem and Simmon. \u201cYou should come in now.\u201d He turned and walked inside.\nThe room wasn\u2019t particularly large. But it seemed bizarrely out of place, nestled in the belly of the Archives. There was a deep padded chair, a large wooden table, and a pair of doorways leading into other rooms.\nBooks were everywhere, overflowing shelves and bookcases. They were piled on the floor, scattered across tables and stacked on chairs. A pair of drawn curtains against one wall surprised me. My mind struggled with the impression that there must be a window behind them, despite the fact that I knew we were deep underground.\nThe room was lit with lamps and candles, long tapers and thick dripping pillars of wax. Each tongue of flame filled me with vague anxiety as I thought of open fire in a building filled with hundreds of thousands of precious books.\nAnd there were puppets. They hung from shelves and pegs on walls. They lay crumpled in corners and under chairs. Some were in the process of being", "built or repaired, scattered among tools across the tabletop. There were shelves full of figurines, each cleverly carved and painted in the shape of a person.\nOn his way to his table, Puppet shrugged out of the black robe and let it fall carelessly to the floor. He was dressed plainly underneath, wrinkled white shirt, wrinkled dark pants, and mismatched socks much mended in the heel. I realized he was older than I\u2019d thought. His face was smooth and unlined, but his hair was pure white and thin on top.\nPuppet cleared a chair for me, carefully removing a small string puppet from the seat and finding it a place on a nearby shelf. He then took a seat at the table, leaving Wilem and Simmon standing. To their credit, they didn\u2019t seem terribly disconcerted.\nDigging a little in the clutter on the table he brought out an irregularly shaped piece of wood and a small knife. He took another long, searching look at my face, then began to methodically whittle, curls of wood falling onto the tabletop.\nOddly enough, I had no desire to ask anyone what was going on. When you ask as many questions as I do, you learn when they are appropriate.\nBesides, I knew what the answers would be. Puppet was one of the talented, not-quite-sane people who had found a niche for themselves at the University.\nArcanum training does unnatural things to students\u2019 minds. The most notable of these unnatural things is the ability to do what most people call magic and we call sympathy, sygaldry, alchemy, naming, and the like.\nSome minds take to it easily, others have difficulty. The worst of these go mad and end up in Haven. But most minds don\u2019t shatter when subjected to the stress of the Arcanum, they simply crack a little. Sometimes these cracks showed in small ways: facial tics, stuttering. Other students heard voices, grew forgetful, went blind, went dumb. . . . Sometimes it was only for an hour or a day. Sometimes it was forever.\nI guessed Puppet was a student who had cracked years ago. Like Auri, he seemed to have found a place for himself, though I marveled at the fact that Lorren let him live down here.\n\u201cDoes he always look like this?\u201d Puppet asked Wilem and Simmon. A small drift of pale wood shavings had gathered around his hands.\n\u201cMostly,\u201d Wilem said.\n\u201cLike what?\u201d Simmon asked.", "\u201cLike he\u2019s just thought through his next three moves in a game of tirani and figured out how he\u2019s going to beat you.\u201d Puppet took another long look at my face and shaved another thin strip of wood away. \u201cIt\u2019s rather irritating, really.\u201d\nWilem barked a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s his thinking face, Puppet. He wears it a lot, but not all the time.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s tirani?\u201d Simmon asked.\n\u201cA thinker,\u201d Puppet mused. \u201cWhat are you thinking now?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking you must be a very careful watcher of people, Puppet,\u201d I said\npolitely.\nPuppet snorted without looking up. \u201cWhat use is care? What good is\nwatching for that matter? People are forever watching things. They should be seeing. I see the things I look at. I am a see-er.\u201d\nHe looked at the piece of wood in his hand, then to my face. Apparently satisfied, he folded his hands over the top of his carving, but not before I glimpsed my own profile cunningly wrought in wood. \u201cDo you know what you have been, what you are not, and what you will be?\u201d He asked.\nIt sounded like a riddle. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cA see-er,\u201d he said with certainty. \u201cBecause that is what E\u2019lir means.\u201d \u201cKvothe is actually a Re\u2019lar,\u201d Simmon said respectfully.\nPuppet sniffed disparagingly. \u201cHardly,\u201d he said, looking at me closely.\n\u201cYou might be a see-er eventually, but not yet. Now you are a look-er. You\u2019ll be a true E\u2019lir at some point. If you learn to relax.\u201d He held out the carved wooden face. \u201cWhat do you see here?\u201d\nIt was no longer an irregular piece of wood. My features, locked in serious contemplation, stared out of the wood grain. I leaned forward to get a closer look.\nPuppet laughed and threw up his hands. \u201cToo late!\u201d he exclaimed, looking childlike for a moment. \u201cYou looked too hard and didn\u2019t see enough. Too much looking can get in the way of seeing, you see?\u201d\nPuppet set the carved face on the tabletop so it seemed to be staring at one of the recumbent puppets. \u201cSee little wooden Kvothe? See him looking? So intent. So dedicated. He\u2019ll look for a hundred years, but will he ever see what is in front of him?\u201d Puppet settled back in his seat, his eyes wandering the room in a contented way.\n\u201cE\u2019lir means see-er?\u201d Simmon asked. \u201cDo the other ranks mean things too?\u201d", "\u201cAs a student with full access to the Archives, I imagine you can find that out for yourself,\u201d Puppet said. His attention focused on a puppet on the table in front of him. He lowered it to the floor carefully to avoid tangling its strings. It was a perfect miniature of a grey-robed Tehlin priest.\n\u201cWould you have any advice as to where he could start looking?\u201d I asked, playing a hunch.\n\u201cRenfalque\u2019s Dictum.\u201d Under Puppet\u2019s direction, the Tehlin puppet raised himself from the floor and moved each of his limbs as if he were stretching after a long sleep.\n\u201cI\u2019m not familiar with that one.\u201d\nPuppet responded in a distracted voice. \u201cIt\u2019s on the second floor in the southeast corner. Second row, second rack, third shelf, right-hand side, red leather binding.\u201d The miniature Tehlin priest walked slowly around Puppet\u2019s feet. Clutched tightly in one hand was a tiny replica of the Book of the Path, perfectly fashioned, right down to the tiny spoked wheel painted on the cover.\nThe three of us watched Puppet pull the strings of the little priest, making it walk back and forth before finally coming to sit on one of Puppet\u2019s stocking-clad feet.\nWilem cleared his throat respectfully. \u201cPuppet?\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d Puppet replied without looking up from his feet. \u201cYou have a question. Or rather, Kvothe has a question and you\u2019re thinking of asking it for him. He is sitting slightly forward in his seat. There is a furrow between his brows and a pursing of the lips that gives it away. Let him ask me. It might do him good.\u201d\nI froze in place, catching myself doing each of the things he had mentioned. Puppet continued to work the strings of his little Tehlin. It made a careful, fearful search of the area around his feet, brandishing the book in front of itself before stepping around table legs and peering into Puppet\u2019s abandoned shoes. Its movements were uncanny, and it distracted me to the point where I forgot I was uncomfortable and felt myself relax.\n\u201cI was wondering about the Amyr, actually.\u201d My eyes remained on the scene unfolding at Puppet\u2019s feet. Another marionette had joined the show, a young girl in a peasant dress. She approached the Tehlin and held out a hand as if trying to give him something. No, she was asking him a question. The Tehlin turned his back on her. She laid a timid hand on his arm. He took a haughty step away. \u201cI was wondering who disbanded them. Emperor Nalto or", "the church.\u201d\n\u201cStill looking,\u201d he admonished more gently then before. \u201cYou need to go\nchase the wind for a while, you are too serious. It will lead you into trouble.\u201d The Tehlin suddenly turned on the girl. Trembling with rage, it menaced her with the book. She took a startled step backward and stumbled to her knees. \u201cThe church disbanded them of course. Only an edict from the pontifex had the ability to affect them.\u201d The Tehlin struck the girl with the book. Once, twice, driving her to the ground, where she lay terribly still. \u201cNalto couldn\u2019t have told them to cross to the other side of the street.\u201d\nSome slight motion drew Puppet\u2019s eye. \u201cOh dear me,\u201d he said, cocking his head toward Wilem. \u201cSee what I see. The head bows slightly. The jaw clenches, but the eyes aren\u2019t fixed on anything, aiming the irritation inward. If I were the sort of person who judged by looking, I\u2019d guess Wilem had just lost a bet. Don\u2019t you know the church frowns on gambling?\u201d At Puppet\u2019s feet, the priest brandished the book upward at Wilem.\nThe Tehlin brought its hands together and turned away from the crumpled woman. It took a stately step or two away and bowed its head as if praying.\nI managed to pull my attention away from the tableau and look up at our host. \u201cPuppet?\u201d I asked, \u201cHave you read the Lights of History by Feltemi Reis?\u201d\nI saw Simmon give Wilem an anxious look, but Puppet didn\u2019t seem to find anything odd about the question. The Tehlin at his feet stood and started to dance and caper about. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would Reis say the Apura Prolycia Amyr was Emperor Nalto\u2019s sixty-third decree?\u201d\n\u201cReis wouldn\u2019t say any such thing,\u201d Puppet said without looking up from the marionette at his feet. \u201cThat\u2019s pure nonsense.\u201d\n\u201cBut we found a copy of Lights that said exactly that,\u201d I pointed out. Puppet shrugged, watching the Tehlin dance at his feet.\n\u201cIt could be a transcription mistake,\u201d Wilem mused. \u201cDepending on the\nedition of the book, the church itself might be responsible for changing that piece of information. Emperor Nalto is history\u2019s favorite whipping boy. It could be the church trying to distance itself from the Amyr. They did some terrible things toward the end.\u201d\n\u201cClever clever,\u201d Puppet said. At his feet the Tehlin made a sweeping bow in Wilem\u2019s direction.\nI was struck by a sudden idea. \u201cPuppet,\u201d I asked. \u201cDo you know what is", "behind the locked door on the floor above this one? The large stone door?\u201d The Tehlin stopped dancing and Puppet looked up. He gave me a long,\nstern look. His eyes were serious and clear. \u201cI don\u2019t think the four-plate door should be of any concern to a student. Do you?\u201d\nI felt myself flush. \u201cNo sir.\u201d I looked away from his eyes.\nThe tension of the moment was broken by the distant sound of the belling tower. Simmon cursed softly. \u201cI\u2019m late,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Puppet, I\u2019ve got to go.\u201d\nPuppet stood and hung the Tehlin on the wall. \u201cIt\u2019s time I got back to my reading, regardless,\u201d he said. He moved to the padded chair, sat, and opened a book. \u201cBring this one back some time.\u201d He gestured in my direction without looking up from his book. \u201cI have some more work to do on him.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER FORTY-ONE": ["CHAPTER FORTY-ONE\nThe Greater Good\nI LOOKED UP AT SIMMON and whispered, \u201cIvare enim euge.\u201d Sim gave a despairing sigh. \u201cYou are supposed to be studying your\nphysiognomy.\u201d\nIt had been a full span since we had set fire to Ambrose\u2019s rooms, and\nwinter was finally showing its teeth, covering the University with knee-deep drifts of blowing snow. As was always the case when the weather turned inclement, the Archives were full to the brim with industrious students.\nSince all the reading holes were occupied, Simmon and I had been forced to bring our books to Tomes. The high-ceilinged, windowless room was more than half full today, but still quiet as a crypt. All the dark stone and muted whispers made the place slightly eerie, making it obvious why students referred to it as Tombs.\n\u201cI am studying my physiognomy,\u201d I protested softly. \u201cI was looking at some of Gibea\u2019s diagrams. Look what I found.\u201d I held out a book for him to see.\n\u201cGibea?\u201d Simmon whispered, horrified. \u201cI swear the only reason you study with me is so you can interrupt.\u201d He pulled away from the book I was offering him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing grotesque,\u201d I protested. \u201cJust . . . here. Just look at what it says here.\u201d Simmon shoved the book away, and my temper flared. \u201cCareful!\u201d I hissed. \u201cThis is one of his originals. I found it behind some other books, buried in Dead Ledgers. Lorren will cut off my thumbs if anything happens to it.\u201d\nSim recoiled from the book as if it were red-hot. \u201cAn original? Merciful Tehlu, it\u2019s probably written on human skin. Get it away from me!\u201d\nI almost joked about how human skin probably wouldn\u2019t take ink, but decided against it when I saw the expression on Sim\u2019s face. Still, my expression must have given me away.\n\u201cYou\u2019re perverse,\u201d he spat, his voice almost rising to unacceptable levels.", "\u201cGod\u2019s mother, don\u2019t you know he cut apart living men to watch their organs work? I refuse to look at anything that monster was responsible for.\u201d\nI set the book down. \u201cYou might as well give up studying medicine then,\u201d I said as gently as possible. \u201cGibea\u2019s research on the human body was the most thorough ever done. His journals are the backbone of modern physic.\u201d\nSimmon\u2019s face stayed hard and he leaned forward so he could speak softly and still be heard. \u201cWhen the Amyr moved against the duke, they found the bones of twenty thousand people. Great pits of bones and ashes. Women and children. Twenty thousand!\u201d Simmon sputtered a bit before he could continue. \u201cAnd those are just the ones they found.\u201d\nI let him calm himself a bit before I said, \u201cGibea wrote twenty-three volumes concerning the machinery of the body,\u201d I pointed out as gently as I could. \u201cWhen the Amyr moved against him, part of his estate burned, four of those volumes and all his notes were lost. Ask Master Arwyl what he would give to have those volumes whole again.\u201d\nSimmon brought his hand down hard on the tabletop, causing several students to look in our direction. \u201cDammit!\u201d he hissed. \u201cI grew up thirty miles from Gibea! From my father\u2019s hills you can see the ruins on a cloudless day!\u201d\nThat stilled me. If Sim\u2019s family lands were that close, his ancestors must have been fealty-bound to Gibea. That meant they might have been forced to help him gather subjects for his experiments. Some of his family might have ended up in the pits of bone and ash themselves.\nI waited a long while before I whispered again, \u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d\nHe regained most of his composure. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about it,\u201d he said stiffly, brushing the hair out of his eyes.\nWe bent to our studies, and it was an hour before Simmon spoke again. \u201cWhat did you find?\u201d he asked too casually, as if not wanting to admit his curiosity.\n\u201cHere on the inner leaf,\u201d I whispered excitedly. I opened the cover and Sim\u2019s face twisted unconsciously as he looked down at the page, as if the book smelled of death.\n\u201c. . . spilled it all over.\u201d I heard a voice as a pair of older students strolled into the hall. By their rich clothes I could tell they were both nobility, and while they weren\u2019t shouting, they weren\u2019t making any effort to be quiet, either. \u201cAnisat made him clear up the mess before he let him wash off. He\u2019ll smell like urea for a span of days.\u201d", "\u201cWhat\u2019s here to see?\u201d Simmon asked, looking down at the page. \u201cIt\u2019s just his name and the dates.\u201d\n\u201cNot the middle, look up at the top. Around the edges of the page.\u201d I pointed at the decorative scrollwork. \u201cRight there.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d wager a drab the little pug poisons himself before the term\u2019s through,\u201d the other one said, \u201cWere we ever that stupid?\u201d\n\u201cI still don\u2019t see anything,\u201d Simmon said softly, making a baffled gesture with both his elbows on the table. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty enough if you like that sort of thing, but I\u2019ve never been a great fan of illuminated texts.\u201d\n\u201cWe could head to the Twopenny.\u201d The conversation continued several tables away, drawing annoyed looks from surrounding students. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a girl there who plays the pipes, I swear you\u2019ve never seen anything like her before. And Linten says if you\u2019ve got a bit of silver she . . .\u201d His voice dropped conspiratorially.\n\u201cShe what?\u201d I asked, butting into their conversation as rudely as possible. I didn\u2019t need to shout. In the Tomes a normal speaking voice carries the whole room. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t quite catch that last bit.\u201d\nThe two of them gave me affronted looks, but didn\u2019t reply.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Sim hissed at me, embarrassed.\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to shut them up,\u201d I said.\n\u201cJust ignore them,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, I\u2019m looking at your damn book. Show\nme what you want me to see.\u201d\n\u201cGibea sketched all his own journals,\u201d I said. \u201cThis is his original, so it\nmakes sense that he did his own scrollwork too, right?\u201d Sim nodded and brushed his hair back from his eyes. \u201cWhat do you see there?\u201d I slowly pointed from one piece of scrollwork to another. \u201cDo you see it?\u201d\nSim shook his head.\nI pointed again, more precisely. \u201cThere,\u201d I said, \u201cand there in the corner.\u201d His eyes widened. \u201cLetters! I . . . v . . .\u201d he paused to puzzle them\nout,\u201cIvare enim euge. That\u2019s what you were rambling about.\u201d He pushed the book away. \u201cSo what\u2019s the point, aside from the fact that he was nearly illiterate in Temic?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Temic.\u201d I pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019s Tema. An archaic usage.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it even supposed to say?\u201d He looked up from his book, his brow creasing. \u201cToward great good?\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cFor greater good,\u201d I corrected. \u201cSound familiar?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how long she\u2019ll be there,\u201d one of the loud pair continued. \u201cIf", "you miss her you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d\n\u201cI told you, I can\u2019t tonight. Maybe on Felling. I\u2019ll be free on Felling.\u201d \u201cYou should go before then,\u201d I told him. \u201cThe Twopenny\u2019s crowded\nFelling night.\u201d\nThey gave me irritated looks. \u201cMind your own business, slipstick,\u201d the\ntaller one said.\nThat got my back up even more. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, weren\u2019t you talking to me?\u201d \u201cDid it look like I was talking to you?\u201d he said scathingly.\n\u201cIt sounded like it,\u201d I said. \u201cIf I can hear you three tables away you must\nwant me to be part of your conversation.\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cThe only alternative is that you\u2019re too thick to keep your voice down in the Tomes.\u201d\nHis face flushed red and he probably would have replied, but his friend said something in his ear and they both gathered their books and left. There was a quiet scattering of applause as the door closed behind them. I gave my audience a smile and a wave.\n\u201cThe scrivs would have taken care of that,\u201d Sim reproached softly as we leaned back over the table to talk.\n\u201cThe scrivs weren\u2019t taking care of it,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s quiet again, and that\u2019s what matters. Now, what does \u2018for greater good\u2019 remind you of?\u201d\n\u201cThe Amyr, of course,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s always the Amyr with you lately. What\u2019s your point?\u201d\n\u201cThe point,\u201d I whispered excitedly, \u201cis that Gibea was a secret member of the order Amyr.\u201d\nSim gave me a skeptical look. \u201cThat\u2019s a bit of a stretch, but I suppose it fits. That was about fifty years before they were denounced by the church. They were pretty corrupt by then.\u201d\nI wanted to point out that Gibea wasn\u2019t necessarily corrupt. He was pursuing the Amyr\u2019s purpose, the greater good. While his experiments had been horrifying, his work advanced medicine in ways it was almost impossible to comprehend. His work had probably saved ten times that many lives in the hundreds of years since.\nHowever, I doubted Sim would appreciate my point. \u201cCorrupt or not, he was a secret member of the Amyr. Why else would he hide their credo in the front cover of his journal?\u201d\nSimmon shrugged. \u201cFine, he was one of the Amyr. What does that have to do with the price of butter?\u201d", "I threw up my hands in frustration and struggled to keep my voice low. \u201cThat means the order had secret members before the church denounced them! That means when the pontifex disbanded them, the Amyr had hidden allies. Allies that could keep them safe. That means the Amyr could still exist today, in secret, pursuing their work in subtle ways.\u201d\nI noticed a change in Simmon\u2019s face. At first I thought he was about to agree with me. Then I felt a prickle on the back of my neck and realized the truth. \u201cHello Master Lorren,\u201d I greeted him respectfully without turning around.\n\u201cSpeaking with students at other tables is not permitted,\u201d he said from behind me. \u201cYou are suspended for five days.\u201d\nI nodded and the two of us came to our feet and gathered up our things. Expressionless, Master Lorren reached out a long hand toward me.\nI handed Gibea\u2019s journal over without comment and a minute later we were blinking in the chill winter sunlight outside the Archive\u2019s doors. I pulled my cloak around me and stomped the snow off my feet.\n\u201cSuspended,\u201d Simmon said. \u201cThat was clever.\u201d\nI shrugged, more embarrassed than I cared to admit. I hoped one of the other students would explain I was actually trying to keep things quiet, rather than the other way around. \u201cI was just trying to do the right thing.\u201d\nSimmon laughed as we began to walk slowly in the direction of Anker\u2019s. He kicked playfully at a small drift of snow. \u201cThe world needs people like you,\u201d Simmon said in the tone of voice that let me know he was turning philosophical. \u201cYou get things done. Not always the best way, or the most sensible way, but it gets done nonetheless. You\u2019re a rare creature.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d I asked, my curiosity piqued.\nSim shrugged. \u201cLike today. Something bothers you, someone offends you, and suddenly you\u2019re off.\u201d He made a quick motion with a flat hand. \u201cYou know exactly what to do. You never hesitate, you just see and react.\u201d He was thoughtful for a moment. \u201cI imagine that\u2019s the way the Amyr used to be. Small wonder folk were frightened of them.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not always so terribly sure of myself,\u201d I admitted. Simmon smiled. \u201cI find that strangely reassuring.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER FORTY-TWO": ["CHAPTER FORTY-TWO\nPenance\nSINCE STUDYING WASN\u2019T AN option and winter was covering everything in drifts of blowing snow, I decided this was the perfect time to catch up on a few things I\u2019d been letting fall by the wayside.\nI tried to pay Auri a visit, but ice covered the rooftops and the courtyard where we usually met was full of drifted snow. I was glad I didn\u2019t see any footprints, as I didn\u2019t think Auri owned shoes, let alone a coat or hat. I would have gone searching for her in the Underthing, but the iron grate in the courtyard was locked and iced over.\nI worked a few double shifts in the Medica and played an extra night at Anker\u2019s as an apology for the evening when I\u2019d had to leave early. I worked long hours in the Fishery, calculating, running tests, and casting alloys for my project. I also made a point of catching up on a month of lost sleep.\nBut there is only so much sleeping one person can do, and by the fourth day of my suspension, I\u2019d run out of excuses. As much as I didn\u2019t want to, I needed to talk to Devi.\nBy the time I made up my mind to go, the weather had warmed just enough so that the falling snow had turned to sheets of freezing sleet.\nIt was a miserable walk to Imre. I didn\u2019t have hat or gloves, and the wind- driven sleet soaked my cloak within five minutes. In ten minutes I was wet through to the skin and wishing I\u2019d waited or spent the money on a carriage. The sleet had melted the snow on the road, and the damp slush was inches thick.\nI stopped by the Eolian to warm myself a bit before heading to Devi\u2019s. But the building was locked and lightless for the first time I\u2019d ever seen. Small wonder. What noble would come out in this weather? What musician would expose their instrument to the freezing damp?\nSo I slogged my way through the deserted streets, eventually coming to the alley behind the butcher\u2019s shop. It was the first time I could remember the stairway not smelling of rancid fat.", "I knocked on Devi\u2019s door, alarmed by how numb my hand was. I could barely feel my knuckles hitting the door. I waited for a long moment, then knocked again, worried that she might not be in, and I\u2019d come all this way for nothing.\nThe door opened just a little. Warm lamplight and a single icy blue eye peered out through the crack. Then the door opened wide.\n\u201cTehlu\u2019s tits and teeth,\u201d Devi said. \u201cWhat are you doing out in this?\u201d\n\u201cI thought\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo you didn\u2019t,\u201d she said disparagingly. \u201cGet in here.\u201d\nI stepped inside, dripping, the hood of my cloak plastered to my head. She\nclosed the door behind me, then locked and bolted it. Looking around I noticed she\u2019d added a second bookshelf, though it was still mostly bare. I shifted my weight and a great mass of damp slush dislodged itself from my cloak and splattered wetly onto the floor.\nDevi gave me a long, dispassionate looking over. I could see a fire crackling in the grate on the other side of the room near her desk, but she made no indication that I should come any farther into the room. So I remained where I was, dripping and shivering.\n\u201cYou never do things the easy way, do you?\u201d she said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an easy way?\u201d I asked.\nShe didn\u2019t laugh. \u201cIf you think showing up here half-frozen and looking\nlike a kicked dog is going to improve my disposition toward you, you\u2019re terribly . . .\u201d She trailed off and looked at me thoughtfully for another long moment. \u201cI\u2019ll be damned,\u201d she said, sounding surprised. \u201cI actually do like seeing you like this. It\u2019s lifting my spirits to an almost irritating degree.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t really my intention,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll take it. Would it help if I caught a terrible cold?\u201d\nDevi considered it. \u201cIt might,\u201d she admitted. \u201cPenance does involve a certain amount of suffering.\u201d\nI nodded, not having to work to look miserable. I dug into my purse with clumsy fingers and brought out a small bronze coin I\u2019d won off Sim playing low-stakes breath several nights ago.\nDevi took it. \u201cA penance piece,\u201d she said, unimpressed. \u201cIs this supposed to be symbolic?\u201d\nI shrugged, causing more slush to spatter to the floor. \u201cSomewhat,\u201d I said. \u201cI thought of going to a moneychanger and settling my entire debt with you in penance coin.\u201d", "\u201cWhat stopped you?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cI realized it would just irritate you,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t looking forward to paying the moneychanger\u2019s fee.\u201d I fought the urge to looking longingly at the fireplace. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of time trying to think of some gesture that might make a suitable apology to you.\u201d\n\u201cYou decided it would be best to walk here during the worst weather of the year?\u201d\n\u201cI decided it would be best if we talked,\u201d I said. \u201cThe weather was just a happy accident.\u201d\nDevi scowled and turned toward the fireplace. \u201cCome in then.\u201d She walked over to a chest of drawers near her bed and brought out a thick blue cotton robe. She handed it to me and motioned to a closed door. \u201cGo change out of your wet clothes. Wring them out in the basin or they\u2019ll take forever to dry.\u201d\nI did as she said, then brought the clothes out and hung them on the pegs in front of the fire. It felt wonderful to stand so close to the fireplace. In the light of the fire I could see that the skin under my fingernails was actually a little blue.\nAs much as I wanted to linger and warm myself, I joined Devi at her desk. I noticed that the top of it had been sanded down and revarnished, though it still bore a coal-black ring where the poor-boy had charred the wood.\nI felt rather vulnerable sitting there wearing nothing but the robe she\u2019d given me, but there was nothing to be done about it. \u201cAfter our previous . . . meeting.\u201d I fought to avoid looking at the charred ring on her desk. \u201cYou informed me that the full amount of my loan would be due at the end of the term. Are you willing to renegotiate that?\u201d\n\u201cUnlikely,\u201d Devi said crisply. \u201cBut rest assured that if you are unable to settle accounts in coin, I\u2019m still in the market for certain pieces of information.\u201d She gave a sharp, hungry smile.\nI nodded, she still wanted access to the Archives. \u201cI was hoping you might be willing to reconsider, as you now know the whole story,\u201d I said. \u201cSomeone was performing malfeasance against me. I needed to know that my blood was safe.\u201d\nI gave her a questioning look. Devi shrugged without taking her elbows off the desk, her expression one of vast indifference.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more,\u201d I said, meeting her eye. \u201cIt is entirely possible that my irrational behavior might have been partially due to the lingering effect of an alchemical poison I was subjected to earlier this term.\u201d", "Devi\u2019s expression went stiff. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nShe hadn\u2019t known then. That was something of a relief. \u201cAmbrose arranged to have me dosed with the plum bob about an hour before my admissions interview,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd you sold him the formula.\u201d\n\u201cYou have a lot of gall!\u201d Devi\u2019s pixie face was outraged and indignant, but it wasn\u2019t convincing. She was off balance and trying too hard.\n\u201cWhat I have,\u201d I said calmly, \u201cis the lingering taste of plum and nutmeg in my mouth, and the occasional irrational desire to choke people for doing nothing more offensive than jostling me on the street.\u201d\nHer false outrage fell away. \u201cYou can\u2019t prove anything,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to prove anything,\u201d I said. \u201cI have no desire to see you in trouble with the masters or up against the iron law.\u201d I looked at her. \u201cI just thought you might be interested in the fact that I was poisoned.\u201d\nDevi sat very still. She fought to maintain her composure, but guilt was creeping onto her expression. \u201cWas it bad?\u201d\n\u201cIt was,\u201d I said quietly.\nDevi looked away and crossed her arms in front of her chest. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was for Ambrose,\u201d she said. \u201cSome rich tosh came around. Made a stunningly good offer. . . .\u201d\nShe looked back at me. Now that the chilly anger had left her, she looked surprisingly small. \u201cI\u2019d never do business with Ambrose,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t know it was for you. I swear.\u201d\n\u201cYou knew it was for someone,\u201d I said.\nThere was a long moment of silence broken only by the occasional crackling of the fire.\n\u201cHere\u2019s how I see it,\u201d I said. \u201cRecently, we\u2019ve both done something rather foolish. Something we regret.\u201d I pulled the robe more closely around my shoulders. \u201cAnd while these two things certainly don\u2019t cancel each other out, it does seem to me that they establish some sort of equilibrium.\u201d I held out my hands like they were the balancing plates on a scale.\nDevi gave me a small, embarrassed smile. \u201cPerhaps I was hasty in demanding full repayment.\u201d\nI returned the smile and felt myself relax. \u201cHow would you feel about sticking to the original terms of our loan?\u201d\n\u201cThat seems fair.\u201d Devi held out her hand over the desk and I shook it. The last of the tension in the room evaporated and I felt a long-standing piece of worry unknot itself in my chest.", "\u201cYour hand is freezing,\u201d Devi said. \u201cLet\u2019s go sit by the fire.\u201d\nWe relocated ourselves and sat quietly for several minutes.\n\u201cGods below,\u201d Devi said with an explosive sigh. \u201cI was so angry with\nyou.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever been that angry with anyone in my whole life.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cI didn\u2019t really believe you\u2019d stoop to malfeasance,\u201d I said. \u201cI was so sure it couldn\u2019t be you. But everyone kept talking about how dangerous you were. Telling stories. Then when you wouldn\u2019t let me see my blood . . .\u201d I trailed off, shrugging.\n\u201cAre you really still getting after-echoes from the plum bob?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cLittle flashes,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I seem to be losing my temper more easily. But that might just be the stress. Simmon says I probably have unbound principles in my system. Whatever that means.\u201d\nDevi scowled. \u201cI\u2019m working with less than ideal equipment here,\u201d she said, gesturing to a closed door. \u201cAnd I am sorry. But the fellow offered me a full set of the Vautium Tegnostae.\u201d She waved to the bookshelves. \u201cNormally I\u2019d never make something like that, but unexpurgated copies are just impossible to find.\u201d\nI turned to look at her, surprised. \u201cYou made it for him?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s better than handing over the formula,\u201d Devi said defensively.\nPart of me felt like I should be angry, but the majority of me was simply\nhappy that I was warm and dry, with no threat of death hanging over me. I shrugged it off. \u201cSimmon says you can\u2019t factor worth half a damn,\u201d I said conversationally.\nDevi looked down at her hands. \u201cI\u2019m not proud of selling it,\u201d she admitted. Then after a moment, she looked up again, grinning. \u201cBut the Tegnostae has gorgeous illustrations.\u201d\nI laughed. \u201cShow me.\u201d\nHours later my clothes were dry and the sleet had changed to a gentle snow. Stonebridge would be a solid sheet of ice, but other than that, the walk home would be much more pleasant.\nWhen I emerged from the washroom I saw Devi was sitting back at her desk. I made my way over and handed her the robe. \u201cI won\u2019t impugn your\n \nhonor by asking why you own a robe much longer and broader in the shoulder than anything a delicate young lady of your size could ever wear.\u201d\nDevi snorted indelicately and rolled her eyes.\nI sat down and tugged on my boots. They were delightfully warm from sitting near the fire. Then I brought out my purse and lay three heavy silver talents on the desk, pushing them toward her. Devi looked at them curiously.\n\u201cI\u2019ve recently come into a little money,\u201d I said. \u201cNot enough to settle my whole debt. But I can pay this term\u2019s interest early.\u201d I waved a hand at the coins. \u201cA gesture of good faith.\u201d\nDevi smiled and pushed the coins back across the table. \u201cYou\u2019ve still got two span before the end of the term,\u201d she said. \u201cLike I said, let\u2019s stick to our original deal. I\u2019d feel bad about taking your money early.\u201d\nThough I\u2019d offered Devi the money as an honest peace offering, I was glad to keep my three talents for now. There is a vast difference between having some coin and no coin. There is a feeling of helplessness that comes from having an empty purse.\nIt\u2019s like seed grain. At the end of a long winter, if you have some grain left, you can use it for seed. You have control over your life. You can use that grain and make plans for the future. But if you have no grain for seed in the spring, you are helpless. No amount of hard work or good intention will make crops grow if you don\u2019t have the seed to start with.\nSo I bought clothes: three shirts, a new pair of pants, and thick woolen socks. I bought a hat and gloves and scarf to keep away the winter\u2019s chill. For Auri I bought a pouch of sea salt, a sack of dried peas, two jars of peach preserves, and a pair of warm slippers. I bought a set of lute strings, ink, and a half-dozen sheets of paper.\nI also bought a sturdy brass drop-bar and screwed it to the window frame in my tiny garret room. I could circumvent it fairly easily, but it would keep my few possessions safe from even the most well-intentioned thieves.\n \n"], "CHAPTER FORTY-THREE": ["CHAPTER FORTY-THREE\nWithout Word or Warning\nI STARED OUT THE FRONT window of Anker\u2019s, looking at the falling snow and idly turning Denna\u2019s ring over in my fingers. Winter lay heavy over the University, and Denna had been gone for more than a month. I had three hours before class with Elodin, and I was trying to decide if the slim chance of finding Denna was worth the long, cold walk to Imre.\nAs I stood at the window, a Cealdish man came through the door, stomping the powdery snow from his boots and looking around curiously. It was still early in the day, and I was the only person in the common room.\nHe walked over to me, snowflakes melting in his beard until they were bright beads of water. \u201cSorry to bother you. I\u2019m looking for a fellow.\u201d he said, surprising me with his utter lack of anything resembling a Cealdish accent. He reached inside his long coat and pulled out a thick envelope with a blood-red seal. \u201cKa-voth-ee.\u201d He read slowly, then turned the envelope toward me so I could see the front.\nKvothe\u2014Anker\u2019s Inn.\nUniversity. (Two miles west of Imre.) Belenay-Barren\nCentral Commonwealth.\nIt was Denna\u2019s handwriting. \u201cIt\u2019s Kvothe, actually,\u201d I said absentmindedly. \u201cThe e is silent.\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cYou him?\u201d\n\u201cI am,\u201d I said.\nHe nodded, satisfied. \u201cWell, I got this down in Tarbean about a span back.\nBought it off a fellow for a hard penny. He said he bought it off a sailor in Junpui for a Vintish silver bit. He couldn\u2019t remember the name of the town where the sailor had got it from, but it was inland a ways.\u201d\nThe man met my eye. \u201cI\u2019m tellin\u2019 you this so you don\u2019t think I\u2019m trying to", "shim you on the deal. I paid a full hard penny, then came over myself from Imre though it was out of my way.\u201d He looked around the common room. \u201cThough I\u2019m guessing a fellow with a fine inn such as this won\u2019t quibble about giving a fellow his due.\u201d\nI laughed. \u201cThis isn\u2019t my inn,\u201d I said. \u201cI just have a room here.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said, obviously a little disappointed. \u201cYou looked kinda proprietorial standing there. Still, I\u2019m sure you see I need to make my money off this.\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d I said. \u201cHow much do you think is fair?\u201d\nHe looked me up and down, eyeing my clothes. \u201cI suppose I\u2019d be happy making my hard penny back and a soft penny besides.\u201d\nI brought out my purse and fished around in it. Luckily, I\u2019d been playing cards a few nights before, and had some Aturan currency. \u201cSeems fair,\u201d I said as I handed over the money.\nHe started to go, then turned back. \u201cOut of curiosity,\u201d he asked. \u201cWould you have paid two hard pennies to get it?\u201d\n\u201cProbably,\u201d I admitted.\n\u201cKist,\u201d he swore, then headed back outside, the door banging behind him. The envelope was heavy parchment, wrinkled and smudged with much\nhandling. The seal showed a stag rampant standing before a barrel and a harp. I pressed it hard between my fingers, shattering it as I sat down.\nThe letter read:\nKvothe,\nI\u2019m sorry to leave Imre without word or warning. I sent You a\nmessage the night of my departure, but I expect you never received it. I have gone abroad looking for greener pasture and better\nOpportunity. I am fond of Imre, and enjoy the pleasure of your Occasional, though Sporadic, company, but it is an expensive city in which to live, and my prospects have grown slender of late.\nYll is lovely, all rolling hills. I find the weather quite to my liking, it is warmer and the air smells of the sea. It seems I might pass an entire winter without being brought to bed by my lungs. My first in years.\nI have spent some time in the Small Kingdoms and saw a skirmish between two bands of mounted men. Such a crashing and Screaming of Horses you have never heard. I have spent some time afloat as well, and learned all manner of sailor\u2019s knots, and how to spit properly. Also, my", "Cussing has been greatly broadened.\nIf you ask politely when we next meet, I may demonstrate my\nnewfound skills.\nI have seen my first Adem Mercenary. (They call them blood-shirts\nhere.) She is hardly bigger than me, with quite the most remarkable grey eyes. She is pretty, but strange and quiet, endlessly twitching. I have not seen her fight and am not sure I wish to. Though I am curious.\nI am still enamoured of the harp. And am currently housing with a skilled gentleman (whom I shall not name) for the furthurinse of my study in this.\nI have drunk some wine while Writing this letter. I mention this to excuse my above spelling of the word Furtherence. Furtherance. Kist. You know what I mean.\nI apologize for not writing sooner, but I have been a great deal traveling and not until now have I had Means to write a Letter. Now that I have done, I expect it might be a while longer before I find a traveler I trust to start this missive on its long road back to you.\nI think of you often and fondly. Yours,\nD.\nPstscrpt. I hope your lute case is serving you well.\nElodin\u2019s class began strangely that day.\nFor one, Elodin was actually on time. This caught us unprepared as the six\nremaining students had taken to spending the first twenty or thirty minutes of the class gossiping, playing cards, and griping about how little we were learning. We didn\u2019t even notice Master Namer until he was halfway down the steps of the lecture hall, clapping his hands to get our attention.\nThe second odd thing was that Elodin was dressed in his formal robes. I\u2019d seen him wear them before when occasion demanded, but always grudgingly. Even during admissions interviews they were usually rumpled and unkempt.\nToday he wore them as if he meant it. They looked sharp and freshly\n     \nlaundered. His hair wasn\u2019t in its normal state of dishevel, either. It looked like it had been trimmed and combed.\nReaching the front of the lecture hall, he climbed onto the dais and moved to stand behind the lectern. This more than anything made everyone sit up and take notice. Elodin never used the lectern.\n\u201cLong ago,\u201d he said without any preamble, \u201cthis was a place where people came to learn secret things. Men and women came to the University to study the shape of the world.\u201d\nElodin looked out at us. \u201cIn this ancient University, there was no skill more sought after than naming. All else was base metal. Namers walked these streets like tiny Gods. They did terrible, wonderful things, and all others envied them.\n\u201cOnly through skill in naming did students move through the ranks. An alchemist without any skill in naming was regarded as a sad thing, no more respected than a cook. Sympathy was invented here, but a sympathist without any naming might as well be a carriage driver. An artificer with no names behind his work was little more than a cobbler or a smith.\n\u201cThey all came to learn the names of things,\u201d Elodin said, his dark eyes intense, his voice resonant and stirring. \u201cBut naming cannot be taught by rule or rote. Teaching someone to be a namer is like teaching someone to fall in love. It is hopeless. It cannot be done.\u201d\nMaster Namer smiled a bit then, for the first time looking like his familiar self. \u201cStill, students tried to learn. And teachers tried to teach. And sometimes they succeeded.\u201d\nElodin pointed. \u201cFela!\u201d He motioned for her to approach. \u201cCome.\u201d\nFela stood, looking nervous as she climbed up to join him on the lecturer\u2019s dais.\n\u201cYou have all chosen the name you hope to learn,\u201d Elodin said, his eyes sweeping over us. \u201cAnd you have all pursued your studies with varying degrees of dedication and success.\u201d\nI fought the urge to look away shamefacedly, knowing that my efforts had been halfhearted at best.\n\u201cWhere you have failed, Fela has succeeded,\u201d Elodin said. \u201cShe has found the name of stone. . . .\u201d He turned sideways to look at her. \u201cHow many times?\u201d\n\u201cEight times,\u201d she said looking down, her hands twisting nervously in front of her.", "There was a murmur of genuine awe from all of us. She had never mentioned this in our frequent griping sessions.\nElodin nodded, as if approving of our reaction. \u201cWhen naming was still taught, we namers wore our prowess proudly. A student who gained mastery over a name would wear a ring as declaration of their skill.\u201d Elodin stretched out a hand in front of Fela and opened it, revealing a river stone, smooth and dark. \u201cAnd this is what Fela will do now, as proof of her ability.\u201d\nStartled, Fela looked at Elodin. Her eyes flickered back and forth between him and the stone, her face growing stricken and pale.\nElodin gave her a reassuring smile. \u201cCome now,\u201d he said gently. \u201cYou know in your secret heart you are capable of this. And more.\u201d\nFela bit her lips and took hold of the stone. It seemed bigger in her hands than it had in his. She closed her eyes for a moment and drew a long, deep breath. She let it out slowly, lifted the stone, and opened her eyes so it was the first thing she would see.\nFela stared at the stone and there was a long moment\u2019s silence. The tension in the room built until it was tight as a harp string. The air vibrated with it.\nA long minute passed. Two long minutes. Three terribly long minutes.\nElodin sighed gustily, breaking the tension. \u201cNo no no,\u201d he said, snapping his fingers near her face to get her attention. He pressed a hand over her eyes like a blindfold. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at it. Don\u2019t look at it. Look at it!\u201d He pulled his hand away.\nFela lifted the stone and opened her eyes. At the same moment Elodin gave her a sharp slap on the back of the head with the flat of his hand.\nShe turned to him, her expression outraged. But Elodin merely pointed at the stone she still held in her hand. \u201cLook!\u201d he said excitedly.\nFela\u2019s eyes went to the stone, and she smiled as if seeing an old friend. She covered it with a hand and brought it close to her mouth. Her lips moved.\nThere was a sudden, sharp cracking sound, as if a speck of water had been dropped into a pan of hot grease. There followed dozens more, so sharp and quick they sounded like an old man popping his knuckles, or a storm of hailstones hitting a hard slate roof.\nFela opened her hand and a scattering of sand and gravel spilled out. With two fingers she reached into the jumble of loose stone and pulled out a ring of sheer black stone. It was round as a cup and smooth as polished glass.\nElodin laughed in triumph before sweeping Fela into an enthusiastic hug. Fela threw her arms around him wildly in return. They took several quick", "steps together that were half stagger, half dance.\nStill grinning, Elodin held out his hand. Fela gave him the ring, and he\nlooked it over carefully before nodding.\n\u201cFela,\u201d he said seriously. \u201cI hereby promote you to the rank of Re\u2019lar.\u201d He\nheld up the ring. \u201cYour hand.\u201d\nAlmost shyly, Fela held out her hand. But Elodin shook his head. \u201cLeft\nhand,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cThe right means something else entirely. None of you are anywhere near ready for that.\u201d\nFela held out her other hand, and Elodin slid the ring of stone easily onto her finger. The rest of the class broke into applause, rushing close to get a look at what she had done.\nFela gave a radiant smile and held out her hand for all of us to see. The ring wasn\u2019t smooth as I\u2019d first thought. It was covered in a thousand tiny, flat facets. They circled each other in a subtle, swirling pattern unlike anything I\u2019d ever seen before.", ""], "CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR": ["CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR\nThe Catch\nDESPITE THE TROUBLE WITH Ambrose, my obsession with the Archives, and my countless fruitless trips to Imre hunting Denna, I managed to finish my project in the Fishery.\nI would have liked another span of days to run a few more tests and tinker with it. But I was simply out of time. The admissions lottery was coming up soon, and my tuition would be due not long after. Before I could put my project up for sale, I needed Kilvin to approve my design.\nSo it was with no small amount of trepidation that I knocked on the door of Kilvin\u2019s office.\nThe Master Artificer was hunched over his personal worktable, carefully removing the screws from the bronze casing of a compression pump. He didn\u2019t look up as he spoke, \u201cYes, Re\u2019lar Kvothe?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m finished, Master Kilvin,\u201d I said simply.\nHe looked up at me, blinking. \u201cAre you now?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I was hoping to make an appointment so I might demonstrate it to\nyou.\u201d\nKilvin set the screws in a tray and brushed his hands together. \u201cFor this I\nam available now.\u201d\nI nodded and led the way through the busy workshop, past Stocks, to the\nprivate workroom Kilvin had assigned me. I brought out the key and unlocked the heavy timber door.\nIt was large as workrooms go, with its own fire well, anvil, fume hood, drench, and other assorted staples of the artificing trade. I\u2019d pushed the worktable aside to leave half of the room empty except for several thick bales of straw stacked against the wall.\nHanging from the ceiling in front of the bales was a crude scarecrow. I\u2019d dressed it in my burned shirt and a pair of sackcloth pants. Part of me wished I\u2019d run a few more tests in the time it had taken to sew the pants and stuff the straw man. But at the end of the day, I am a trouper first and all else second.", "As such, I couldn\u2019t ignore the chance for a little showmanship.\nI closed the door behind us while Kilvin looked around the room curiously.\nDeciding to let my work speak for itself, I brought out the crossbow and handed it to him.\nThe huge master\u2019s expression went dark. \u201cRe\u2019lar Kvothe,\u201d he said, his voice heavy with disapproval. \u201cTell me you have not squandered the labor of your hands on the improvement of such a beastly thing.\u201d\n\u201cTrust me, Master Kilvin,\u201d I said, holding it out to him.\nHe gave me a long look, then took the crossbow and began to examine it with the meticulous care of a man who spent every day working with deadly equipment. He fingered the tightly woven string and eyed the curved metal arm of the bow.\nAfter several long minutes he nodded, put one foot through the stirrup, and cocked it without any noticeable effort. Idly, I wondered how strong Kilvin was. My shoulders ached and my hands were blistered from struggling with the unwieldy thing over the last several days.\nI handed him the heavy bolt and he examined it as well. I could see him looking increasingly perplexed. I knew why. The bow didn\u2019t have any obvious modifications or sygaldry. Neither did the bolt.\nKilvin slotted the bolt into the crossbow and raised an eyebrow at me.\nI made an expansive gesture to the straw man, trying to look more confident than I felt. My hands were sweating and my stomach was full of doves. Tests were fine and good. Tests were important. Tests were like rehearsal. But all that really matters is what happens when the audience is watching. This is a truth all troupers know.\nKilvin shrugged and raised the crossbow. It looked small braced against his broad shoulder, and he took a moment to carefully sight along the top of it. I was surprised to see him calmly draw half a breath, then exhale slowly as he pulled the trigger.\nThe crossbow jerked, the string twanged, the bolt blurred.\nThere was a harsh, metallic clank, and the bolt stopped midair as if it had struck an invisible wall. It clattered to the stone floor in the middle of the room, fifteen feet away from the straw man.\nUnable to help myself, I laughed and threw my arms triumphantly into the air.\nKilvin raised his eyebrows and looked at me. I grinned a manic grin.\nThe master retrieved the bolt from the floor and examined it again. Then he", "recocked the crossbow, sighted, and pulled the trigger.\nClank. The bolt dropped to the floor a second time, skittering slightly to\none side.\nThis time Kilvin spotted the source of the noise. Hanging from the ceiling\nin the far corner of the room was a metal object the size of a large lantern. It was rocking back and forth and spinning slightly, as if someone had just struck it a glancing blow.\nI took it off its hook and brought it back to where Master Kilvin waited at the worktable. \u201cWhat is this thing, Re\u2019lar Kvothe?\u201d he said curiously.\nI set it down on the table with a heavy clunk. \u201cIn general terms, Master Kilvin, it\u2019s an automatically triggered kinetic opposition device.\u201d I beamed proudly. \u201cMore specifically, it stops arrows.\u201d\nKilvin bent to look at it, but there was nothing to see except for featureless plates of dark iron. My creation looked like nothing so much as a large, eight- sided lantern made entirely of metal.\n\u201cAnd what do you call it?\u201d\nThat was the one part of my invention I hadn\u2019t managed to finish. I\u2019d thought of a hundred names, but none of them seemed to fit. Arrow-trap was pedestrian. The Traveler\u2019s Friend was prosaic. Banditbane was ridiculously melodramatic. I could never have looked Kilvin in the eye again if I\u2019d tried to call it that.\n\u201cI\u2019m having some trouble with the name,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut for now I\u2019m calling it an arrowcatch.\u201d\n\u201cHmmph,\u201d Kilvin grunted. \u201cIt does not catch the arrow, precisely.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d I said, exasperated. \u201cBut it was either that or call it a \u2018clank.\u2019 \u201d Kilvin looked at me sideways, his eyes smiling a little. \u201cOne would think a\nstudent of Elodin\u2019s would prove more facile with his naming, Re\u2019lar Kvothe.\u201d\n\u201cDelivari had it easy, Master Kilvin,\u201d I said.\u201cHe just made a better axle and stuck his name on it. I can\u2019t very well call this \u2018the Kvothe.\u2019 \u201d\nKilvin chuckled. \u201cTrue.\u201d He turned back to the arrowcatch, eyeing it curiously. \u201cHow does it work?\u201d\nI grinned and brought out a large roll of paper covered in diagrams, complicated sygaldry, metallurgical symbols, and painstaking formulae for kinetic conversion.\n\u201cThere are two main parts,\u201d I said. \u201cThe first is the sygaldry that automatically forms a sympathetic link with any thin, fast-moving piece of", "metal within twenty feet. I don\u2019t mind telling you that took me a long couple of days to figure out.\u201d\nI tapped the appropriate runes on the piece of paper. \u201cAt first I thought that might be enough by itself. I hoped if I bound an incoming arrowhead to a stationary piece of iron, it would absorb the arrow\u2019s momentum and make it harmless.\u201d\nKilvin shook his head. \u201cIt has been tried before.\u201d\n\u201cI should have realized before I even tried,\u201d I said. \u201cAt best it only absorbs a third of the arrow\u2019s momentum, and anyone two-thirds arrowshot is still going to be in a bad way.\u201d\nI gestured to a different diagram. \u201cWhat I really needed was something that could push back against the arrow. And it had to push very fast and very hard. I ended up using the spring steel from a bear trap. Modified, of course.\u201d\nI picked up a spare arrowhead from the worktable and pretended it was moving toward the arrowcatch. \u201cFirst, the arrow comes close and establishes the binding. Second, the incoming arrow\u2019s momentum sets off the trigger, just like stepping on a trap.\u201d I snapped my fingers sharply. \u201cThen the spring\u2019s stored energy pushes back at the arrow, stopping it or even knocking it backward.\u201d\nKilvin was nodding along. \u201cIf it needs to be reset after each use, how did it stop my second bolt?\u201d\nI pointed to the central diagram. \u201cThis wouldn\u2019t be of much use if it only stopped one arrow,\u201d I said. \u201cOr if it only stopped arrows coming from one direction. I designed it to have eight springs in a circle. It should be able to stop arrows from several directions at once.\u201d I shrugged apologetically. \u201cIn theory. I haven\u2019t been able to test that.\u201d\nKilvin looked back at the straw man. \u201cBoth of my shots came from the same direction,\u201d he said. \u201cHow was the second one stopped if that spring had already been triggered?\u201d\nI picked up the arrowcatch by the ring I\u2019d set into the top and showed how it could rotate freely. \u201cIt hangs on a pivot ring,\u201d I said. \u201cThe shock of the first arrow set it spinning slightly, which brought a new spring into alignment. Even if it hadn\u2019t, the energy of the incoming arrow tends to swing it around to the nearest untriggered spring, like a weathervane points into the wind.\u201d\nI hadn\u2019t actually planned the last. It had been a lucky accident, but I didn\u2019t see any reason to tell Kilvin that.\nI touched the red dots visible on two of the eight iron faces of the", "arrowcatch. \u201cThese show which springs have been triggered.\u201d\nKilvin took it from me and turned it in his hands. \u201cHow do you reset the\nsprings?\u201d\nI slid a metal device out from under the worktable, little more than a piece\nof iron with a long lever attached. Then I showed Kilvin the eight-sided hole in the bottom of the arrowcatch. I fit the arrowcatch onto the device and pressed down on the lever with my foot until I heard a sharp click. Then I rotated the arrowcatch and repeated the process.\nKilvin bent to pick it up and turned it over in his huge hands. \u201cHeavy,\u201d he commented.\n\u201cIt needed to be sturdy,\u201d I said. \u201cA crossbow bolt can punch through a two-inch oak plank. I needed the spring to snap back with at least three times that much force to stop the arrow.\u201d\nKilvin shook the arrowcatch idly, holding it to the side of his head. It didn\u2019t make any noise. \u201cAnd what if the arrowheads are not made of metal?\u201d he asked. \u201cVi Sembi raiders are said to use arrows of flint or obsidian.\u201d\nI looked down at my hands and sighed. \u201cWell . . .\u201d I said slowly. \u201cIf the arrowheads aren\u2019t some sort of iron, the arrowcatch wouldn\u2019t trigger when they came within twenty feet.\u201d\nKilvin gave a noncommittal grunt and set the arrowcatch back down on the table with a thump.\n\u201cBut,\u201d I said brightly. \u201cWhen it came within fifteen feet, any piece of sharp stone or glass would trigger a different set of bindings.\u201d I tapped my schema. I was proud of it, as I\u2019d also had the foresight to inscribe the inset pieces of obsidian with the sygaldry for twice-tough glass. That way they wouldn\u2019t shatter under the impact.\nKilvin glanced at the schema, then grinned proudly and chuckled deep in his chest. \u201cGood. Good. What if the arrow has a head of bone or ivory?\u201d\n\u201cThe runes for bone aren\u2019t trusted to a lowly Re\u2019lar like myself,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd if they were?\u201d Kilvin asked.\n\u201cThen I still wouldn\u2019t use them,\u201d I said. \u201cLest some child doing a\ncartwheel trigger the arrowcatch with a thin, quickly moving piece of their skull.\u201d\nKilvin nodded his approval. \u201cI was thinking of a galloping horse,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you show your wisdom in this.You show you have the careful mind of an artificer.\u201d\nI turned back to the schema and pointed. \u201cThat said, Master Kilvin, at ten", "feet a fast-moving cylindrical piece of wood will trigger the arrowcatch.\u201d I sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good link, but it\u2019s enough to stop the arrow, or at least deflect it.\u201d\nKilvin bent to examine the schema more closely, his eyes wandering the crowded page for a long couple of minutes. \u201cAll iron?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cCloser to steel, Master Kilvin. I worried iron would be too brittle in the long term.\u201d\n\u201cAnd each of these eighteen bindings are inscribed on each of the springs?\u201d he asked, gesturing.\nI nodded.\n\u201cThat is a great duplication of effort,\u201d Kilvin said, his tone more conversational than accusatory. \u201cSome might say such a thing is overbuilt.\u201d\n\u201cI care very little what other people think, Master Kilvin,\u201d I said. \u201cOnly what you think.\u201d\nHe grunted, then looked up from the paper and turned to face me. \u201cI have four questions.\u201d\nI nodded expectantly.\n\u201cFirst, of all things, why make this?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cNo one should ever die from ambush on the road,\u201d I said firmly.\nKilvin waited, but I had nothing more to say on the matter. After a moment\nhe shrugged and gestured to the other side of the room. \u201cSecond, where did you get the . . .\u201d His brow furrowed slightly. \u201cTevetbem. The flatbow?\u201d\nMy stomach clenched at the question. I\u2019d held the vain hope that Kilvin, being Cealdish, wouldn\u2019t know such things were illegal here in the Commonwealth. Barring that, I\u2019d hoped he simply wouldn\u2019t ask.\n\u201cI . . . procured it, Master Kilvin,\u201d I said evasively. \u201cI needed it to test the arrowcatch.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not use a simple hunter\u2019s bow?\u201d Kilvin said sternly. \u201cAnd thereby avoid the need of illegal procurement?\u201d\n\u201cIt would be too weak, Master Kilvin. I needed to be sure my design would stop any arrow, and a crossbow fires a bolt harder than any other.\u201d\n\u201cA Modegan longbow is equal of a flatbow,\u201d Kilvin said.\n\u201cBut the use of one is beyond my skill,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd the purchase of a Modegan bow is far beyond my means.\u201d\nKilvin let out a deep sigh. \u201cBefore, when you made your thief \u2019s lamp, you made a bad thing in a good way. That I do not like.\u201d He looked down at the schema. \u201cThis time you have made a good thing in a bad way. That is better,", "but not entirely. Best is to make a good thing in a good way. Agreed?\u201d I nodded.\nHe lay one massive hand on the crossbow. \u201cDid anyone see you with it?\u201d I shook my head.\n\u201cThen we will say it is mine, and you procured it under my advisement. It\nwill join the equipment in Stocks.\u201d He gave me a hard look. \u201cAnd in the future you will come to me if you need such things.\u201d\nThat stung a bit, as I\u2019d been planning on selling it back to Sleat. Still, it could have been worse. The last thing I wanted was to run afoul of the iron law.\n\u201cThird, I see no mention of gold wire or silver in your schema,\u201d he said. \u201cNor can I imagine any use they could be put to in such a device as yours. Explain why you have checked these materials out of Stocks.\u201d\nI was suddenly pointedly aware of the cool metal of my gram against the inside of my arm. Its inlay was gold, but I could hardly tell him that. \u201cI was short on money, Master Kilvin. And I needed materials I couldn\u2019t get in Stocks.\u201d\n\u201cSuch as your flatbow.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cAnd the straw and the bear traps.\u201d\n\u201cWrong follows wrong,\u201d Kilvin said disapprovingly. \u201cThe Stocks are not a\nmoneylender\u2019s stall and should not be used as such. I am rescinding your precious metals authorization.\u201d\nI bowed my head, hoping I looked appropriately chastised.\n\u201cYou will also work twenty hours in Stocks as your punishment. If anyone asks, you will tell them what you did. And explain that as a punishment you were forced to repay the value of the metals plus an additional twenty percent. If you use Stocks as a moneylender, you will be charged interest like a moneylender.\u201d\nI winced at that. \u201cYes, Master Kilvin.\u201d\n\u201cLast,\u201d Kilvin said, turning to lay one huge hand on the arrowcatch. \u201cWhat do you imagine such a thing would sell for, Re\u2019lar Kvothe?\u201d\nMy heart rose in my chest. \u201cDoes that mean you approve it for sale, Master Kilvin?\u201d\nThe great bearlike artificer gave me a puzzled look. \u201cOf course I approve it, Re\u2019lar Kvothe. It is a wondrous thing. It is an improvement to the world. Every time a person sees such a thing, they will see how artificery is used to keep men safe. They will think well of all artificers for the making of such a", "thing.\u201d\nHe looked down at the arrowcatch, frowning thoughtfully. \u201cBut if we are\nto sell it, it must have a price. What do you suggest?\u201d\nI\u2019d been wondering on this question for six span. The simple truth was I\nhoped it would bring me enough money to pay for my tuition and my interest on Devi\u2019s loan. Enough to keep me in the University for one more term.\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know, Master Kilvin,\u201d I said. \u201cHow much would you pay to avoid having a long yard of ash arrow shot through your lung?\u201d\nHe chuckled. \u201cMy lung is quite valuable,\u201d he said. \u201cBut let us think in other terms. Materials come to . . .\u201d He glanced at the schema. \u201cRoughly nine jots, am I correct?\u201d\nUncannily correct. I nodded.\n\u201cHow many hours did it take you to make?\u201d\n\u201cAbout a hundred,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe a hundred and twenty. But a lot of that\nwas experimentation and testing. I could probably make another in fifty or sixty hours. Less if moldings are made.\u201d\nKilvin nodded. \u201cI suggest twenty-five talents. Does that seem reasonable to you?\u201d\nThe sum took my breath away. Even after I repaid Stocks for materials and the workshop took its forty percent commission, it was six times more than I\u2019d earn working on deck lamps. An almost ridiculous amount of money.\nI began to agree enthusiastically, then a thought occurred to me. Though it pained me, I slowly shook my head. \u201cHonestly, Master Kilvin. I\u2019d prefer to sell them more cheaply than that.\u201d\nHe raised an eyebrow. \u201cThey will pay it,\u201d he reassured me. \u201cI have seen people pay more for less useful things.\u201d\nI shrugged. \u201cTwenty-five talents is a lot of money,\u201d I said. \u201cSafety and peace of mind shouldn\u2019t only be available to those with heavy purses. I think eight would be a great plenty.\u201d\nKilvin looked at me for a long moment, then nodded. \u201cAs you say. Eight talents.\u201d He ran his hand over the top of the arrowcatch, almost petting it. \u201cHowever, as this is the first and only one in existence, I will pay you twenty- five for it. It will go in my personal collection.\u201d He cocked his head at me. \u201cLhinsatva?\u201d\n\u201cLhin,\u201d I said gratefully, feeling a great weight of anxiety lifting off my shoulders.\nKilvin smiled and nodded toward the table. \u201cI would also like to examine", "the schema at my leisure. Would you like to make me a copy?\u201d\n\u201cFor twenty-five talents,\u201d I said, smiling as I slid the paper across the table,\n\u201cyou can have the original.\u201d\nKilvin wrote me a receipt and left, clutching the arrowcatch like a child with a new favorite toy.\nI hurried to Stocks with my slip of paper. I had to settle my debt for materials, including the gold wire and silver ingots. But even after the workshop took its commission I was left with almost eleven talents.\nI went through the remainder of the day grinning and whistling like an idiot. It is as they say: a heavy purse makes for a light heart.\n \n"], "CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE": ["CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE\nConsortation\nI SAT ON THE HEARTH at Anker\u2019s with my lute in my lap. The room was warm and quiet, full of people who had come to hear me play.\nFelling was my regular night at Anker\u2019s, and it was always busy. Even in the worst weather there weren\u2019t enough chairs, and those who came late were forced to cluster around the bar and lean against walls. Lately, Anker had needed to bring in an extra girl on Felling night just to hurry drinks around the room.\nOutside the inn, winter was still clutching at the University, but inside the air was warm and sweet with the smell of beer and bread and broth. Over the months I had slowly trained my audience to be properly attentive while I played, so the room was hushed as I fingered my way through the second verse of \u201cViolet Bide.\u201d\nI was in fine form that night. My audience had bought me half a dozen drinks, and in a fit of generosity, a tipsy scriv had tossed a hard penny into my lute case where it lay shining among the dull iron and copper. I\u2019d made Simmon cry twice, and Anker\u2019s new serving girl was smiling and blushing at me with such frequency that even I couldn\u2019t miss the signal. She had beautiful eyes.\nFor the first time I could remember, I actually felt like I had some control over my life. There was money in my purse. My studies were going well. I had access to the Archives, and despite the fact that I was forced to work in Stocks, everyone knew Kilvin was terribly pleased with me.\nThe only thing missing was Denna.\nI looked down at my hands as I entered into the final chorus of \u201cViolet Bide.\u201d I\u2019d had a few more drinks than I was used to, and I didn\u2019t want to fumble. As I watched my fingers, I heard the door of the taproom open and felt a chill wind curl around the room. The fire swayed and danced beside me as I heard boots moving across the wooden floor.\nThe room was quiet as I sang:", "She sits by her window.\nShe sips at her tea.\nShe waits for her love,\nTo return from the sea.\nHer suitors come calling.\nShe watches the tides,\nAnd all the while Violet bides.\nI hit the final chord but instead of the thunderous applause I expected, there was only an echoing quiet. I looked up and saw four tall men standing in front of the hearth. The shoulders of their heavy cloaks were wet with melted snow. Their faces were grim.\nThree of them wore the dark round caps that marked them as constables. And if that weren\u2019t clue enough as to their business, each of them carried a long oak cudgel bound in iron. They watched me like hard-eyed hawks.\nThe fourth man stood aside from the others. He didn\u2019t wear a constable\u2019s cap and wasn\u2019t nearly so tall or broad across the shoulders. Despite that, he carried himself with undeniable authority. His face was lean and grim as he drew out a piece of heavy parchment decorated with several black, official- looking seals.\n\u201cKvothe, Arliden\u2019s son,\u201d he read aloud to the room, his voice clear and strong. \u201cIn the sight of these witnesses I bind you to stand to your own account before the iron law. You are charged with Consortation with Demonic Powers, Malicious Use of Unnatural Arts, Unprovoked Assault, and Malfeasance.\u201d\nNeedless to say, I was caught completely flat-footed. \u201cWhat?\u201d I said stupidly. As I said, I\u2019d had more than a few drinks.\nThe grim man ignored me and turned to one of the constables. \u201cBind him.\u201d\nOne of the constables drew out a length of clattering iron chain. Up until now I\u2019d been too startled to be properly afraid, but the sight of this grim- faced man pulling a pair of dark iron manacles out of a sack filled me with a fear that turned my bones to water.\nSimmon appeared next to the hearth, pushing his way past the constables to stand in front of the fourth man.\n\u201cWhat exactly is going on here?\u201d Sim demanded, his voice hard and angry. It was the only time I\u2019d ever heard him sound like the son of a duke. \u201cExplain yourself.\u201d", "The man holding the parchment eyed Simmon calmly, then reached inside his cloak and brought out a stout iron rod with a band of gold around each end. Sim paled a bit as the grim man held it up for everyone in the room to see. Not only was it every bit as threatening as the constable\u2019s cudgels, the rod was an unmistakable symbol of his authority. The man was a sumner for the Commonwealth courts. Not just a regular sumner either, the gold bands meant he could order anyone to stand before the iron law: priests, government officials, even members of the nobility up to the rank of baron.\nAt this point Anker made his way through the crowd as well. He and Sim looked over the sumner\u2019s document and found it to be very legitimate and official. It was signed and sealed by all manner of important people in Imre. There was nothing to be done. I was going to be brought up against the iron law.\nEveryone at Anker\u2019s watched as I was bound hand and foot in chains. Some of them looked shocked, some confused, but most of them simply looked frightened. When the constables dragged me through the crowd toward the door, barely a handful of my audience were willing to meet my eye.\nThey marched me the long way back to Imre. Over Stonebridge and down the flat expanse of the great stone road. All the way the winter wind chilled the iron around my hands and feet until it burned and bit and froze my skin.\nThe next morning Sim arrived with Elxa Dal and matters slowly became clear. It had been months since I had called the name of the wind in Imre after Ambrose broke my lute. The masters had brought me up on charges of malfeasance and had me publicly whipped at the University. It had been so long ago that the lash marks on my back were nothing more than pale silver scars. I had thought the matter resolved.\nApparently not. Since the incident had occurred in Imre, it fell under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth courts.\nWe live in a civilized age, and few places are more civilized than the University and its immediate environs. But parts of the iron law are left over from darker times. It had been a hundred years since anyone had been burned for Consortation or Unnatural Arts, but the laws were still there. The ink was\n \nfaded, but the words were clear.\nAmbrose wasn\u2019t directly involved, of course. He was much too clever for\nthat. This sort of trial was bad for the University\u2019s reputation. If Ambrose had brought this case against me it would have infuriated the masters. They worked hard to protect the good name of the University in general and of the Arcanum in particular.\nSo Ambrose was in no way connected with the charges. Instead, the case was brought before Imre\u2019s courts by a handful of Imre\u2019s influential nobles. Oh, certainly they knew Ambrose, but that wasn\u2019t incriminating. Ambrose knew everyone with power, blood, or money on either side of the river, after all.\nThus was I brought up against the iron law. For the space of six days it was a source of extraordinary irritation and anxiety to me. It disrupted my studies, brought my work in the Fishery to a standstill, and drove the final nail into the coffin I used to bury my hopes of ever finding a local patron.\nWhat started as a terrifying experience quickly became a tedious process filled with pomp and ritual. More than forty letters of testimony were read aloud, confirmed, and copied into the official records. There were days filled with nothing but long speeches. Quotations from the iron law. Points of procedure. Formal modes of address. Old men reading out of old books.\nI defended myself to the best of my ability, first in the Commonwealth court, then in church courts as well. Arwyl and Elxa Dal spoke on my behalf. Or rather, they wrote letters, then read them aloud to the court.\nIn the end, I was cleared of any wrongdoing. I thought I was vindicated. I thought I had won. . . .\nBut I was still terribly naive in many ways.", ""], "CHAPTER FORTY-SIX": ["CHAPTER FORTY-SIX\nInterlude\u2014A Bit of Fiddle\nKVOTHE CAME SLOWLY TO his feet and gave a quick stretch. \u201cLet\u2019s pause there for now,\u201d he said. \u201cI expect we\u2019ll see more than the usual number of people for lunch today. I need to check on the soup and get a few things ready.\u201d He nodded to Chronicler. \u201cYou might want to do the same.\u201d\nChronicler remained seated. \u201cWait a minute,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was your trial in Imre?\u201d He looked down at the page, dismayed. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cNot much to it, really.\u201d\n\u201cBut that\u2019s the first story I ever heard about you when I came to the University,\u201d Chronicler protested. \u201cHow you learned Tema in a day. How you spoke your entire defense in verse and they applauded afterward. How you . . .\u201d\n\u201cA lot of nonsense, I expect,\u201d Kvothe said dismissively as he walked back to the bar. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the bones of it.\u201d\nChronicler looked down at the page. \u201cYou seem to be giving it pretty short shrift.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re desperate for the full account, you can find it elsewhere,\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cDozens of people saw the trial. There are already two full written accounts. I see no need to add a third.\u201d\nChronicler was taken aback. \u201cYou\u2019ve already spoken to a historian about this?\u201d\nKvothe chuckled deep in his throat. \u201cYou sound like a jilted lover.\u201d He began to bring out stacks of bowls and plates from beneath the bar. \u201cRest assured, you\u2019re the first to get my story.\u201d\n\u201cYou said there were written accounts,\u201d Chronicler said. Then his eyes widened. \u201cAre you telling me you\u2019ve written a memoir?\u201d There was a strange note in the scribe\u2019s voice, something almost like hunger.\nKvothe frowned. \u201cNo, not really.\u201d He gave a gusty sigh. \u201cI started something of the sort, but I gave it up as a bad idea.\u201d\n\u201cYou wrote all the way to your trial in Imre?\u201d Chronicler said, looking at", "the paper in front of him. Only then did he realize he was still holding his pen poised above the page. He began to unscrew and clean the brass nib of the pen on a cloth with an air of vast irritation. \u201cIf you already had all this written down, you could have saved me cramping my hand for the last day and a half.\u201d\nKvothe\u2019s forehead creased in confusion. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nChronicler rubbed the nib briskly with a cloth, every motion screaming with affronted dignity. \u201cI should have known,\u201d he said. \u201cIt all fit together too smoothly.\u201d He glared up. \u201cDo you know how much this paper cost me?\u201d He made an angry gesture to the satchel that held the finished pages.\nKvothe simply stared at him for a moment, then laughed with sudden understanding. \u201cYou misunderstand. I gave up the memoir after a day or so. I wrote a handful of pages. Not even that.\u201d\nThe irritation faded from Chronicler\u2019s face, leaving a sheepish expression. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cYou are like a wounded lover,\u201d Kvothe said, amused. \u201cGood lord, calm yourself. My story is virginal. Yours are the first hands to touch it.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s something different about writing a story down. I don\u2019t seem to have the knack for it. It came out all wrong.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d love to see what you wrote,\u201d Chronicler said, leaning forward in his chair. \u201cEven if it\u2019s just a few pages.\u201d\n\u201cIt was quite a while ago,\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I remember where the pages are.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re up in your room, Reshi,\u201d Bast said brightly. \u201cOn your desk.\u201d\nKvothe gave a deep sigh. \u201cI was trying to be gracious, Bast. The truth is, there\u2019s nothing on them worth showing to anyone. If I\u2019d written anything worth reading, I would have kept writing it.\u201d He walked into the kitchen and there were muted, bustling sounds from the back room.\n\u201cGood try,\u201d Bast said softly. \u201cBut it\u2019s a lost cause. I\u2019ve tried.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t coach me,\u201d Chronicler said testily. \u201cI know how to get a story out of a person.\u201d\nThere was more bumping from the back room, a splash of water, the sound of a door closing.\nChronicler looked at Bast. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you go help him?\u201d\nBast shrugged, lounging further back into his chair.\nAfter a moment, Kvothe emerged from the back room carrying a cutting\nboard and a bowl full of freshly scrubbed vegetables.", "\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m still confused,\u201d Chronicler said. \u201cHow can there already be two written accounts if you never wrote it yourself or talked to a historian?\u201d\n\u201cNever been brought to trial, have you?\u201d Kvothe said, amused. \u201cThe Commonwealth courts keep painstaking records, and the church is even more obsessive. If you have a desperate desire for the details, you can dig around in their deposition ledgers and act books respectively.\u201d\n\u201cThat might be the case,\u201d Chronicler said. \u201cBut your account of the trial . . .\u201d\n\u201cWould be tedious,\u201d Kvothe said. He finished paring the carrots, and began to cut them. \u201cEndless formal speeches and readings from the Book of the Path. It was tedious to live through, and it would be tedious to repeat.\u201d\nHe brushed the sliced carrots from the board into a nearby bowl. \u201cI\u2019ve probably kept us at the University too long, anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll need the time for other things. Things no one has ever seen or heard.\u201d\n\u201cReshi no!\u201d Bast shouted in alarm, sitting bolt upright in his chair. His expression was plaintive as he pointed to the bar. \u201cBeets?\u201d\nKvothe looked down at the dark red root on the cutting board as if surprised to see it there.\n\u201cDon\u2019t put beets in the soup, Reshi,\u201d Bast said. \u201cThey\u2019re foul.\u201d\n\u201cA lot of people like beets, Bast,\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re healthful. Good for the blood.\u201d\n\u201cI hate beets,\u201d Bast said piteously.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Kvothe said calmly, \u201csince I\u2019m finishing the soup, I get to pick what goes into it.\u201d\nBast came to his feet and stomped toward the bar. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it then,\u201d he said impatiently, making a shooing motion. \u201cYou go get some sausage and one of those veiny cheeses.\u201d He pushed Kvothe toward the basement steps before storming into the kitchen, muttering. Soon there was the sound of rattling and thumping from the back room.\nKvothe looked over at Chronicler and gave a wide, lazy smile.\nPeople began to trickle into the Waystone Inn. They came in twos and threes, smelling of sweat and horses and freshly mown wheat. They laughed and talked and tracked chaff across the clean wooden floors.\n \nChronicler did a brisk business. Folk sat leaning forward in their chairs, sometimes gesturing with their hands, sometimes speaking with slow deliberation. The scribe\u2019s face was impassive as his pen scratched across the page, occasionally darting back for ink.\nBast and the man who called himself Kote worked together as a comfortable team. They served up soup and bread. Apples, cheese, and sausage. Beer and ale and cool water from the pump out back. There was roasted mutton too, for those who wanted it, and fresh apple pie.\nMen and women smiled and relaxed, glad to be off their feet and sitting in the shade. The room was full of the gentle buzz of conversation as folk gossiped with neighbors they had known their whole lives. Familiar insults, soft and harmless as butter, were traded back and forth, and friends had comfortable arguments about whose turn it was to buy the beer.\nBut underneath it all, there was a tension in the room. A stranger would never have noticed it, but it was there, dark and silent as an undertow. No one spoke of taxes, or armies, or how they had begun to lock their doors at night. No one spoke of what had happened in the inn the night before. No one eyed the stretch of well-scrubbed wooden floor that didn\u2019t show a trace of blood.\nInstead there were jokes and stories. A young wife kissed her husband, drawing whistles and hoots from the rest of the room. Old Man Benton tried to lift up the hem of the Widow Creel\u2019s skirt with his cane, cackling when she swatted him. A pair of little girls chased each other around the tables, shrieking and laughing while everyone watched and smiled fond smiles. It helped a bit. It was all that you could do.\nThe inn\u2019s door banged open. Old Cob, Graham, and Jake trudged in out of the brilliant midday sunlight.\n\u201cHullo Kote!\u201d Old Cob called, looking around at the handful of people spread around the inn. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a bit of a crowd in here today!\u201d\n\u201cYou missed the bigger part of it,\u201d Bast said. \u201cWe were downright frantic for a while.\u201d\n\u201cAnything left for the stragglers?\u201d Graham asked as he sank onto his stool.\nBefore he could reply, a bull-shouldered man clattered an empty plate onto the bar and set a fork down gently beside it. \u201cThat,\u201d he said in a booming\n \nvoice, \u201cwas a damn fine pie.\u201d\nA thin woman with a pinched face stood next to him. \u201cDon\u2019t you cuss,\nElias,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cThere\u2019s no call for that.\u201d\n\u201cOh honey,\u201d the big man said. \u201cDon\u2019t get yourself in a twit. Damfine is a\nkind of apple, innit?\u201d He grinned around at the folks sitting at the bar. \u201cSort of foreign apple from off in Atur? They named it after Baron Damfine if I remember correct.\u201d\nGraham grinned back at him. \u201cI think I heard that.\u201d\nThe woman glared at all of them.\n\u201cI got these from the Bentons,\u201d the innkeeper said meekly.\n\u201cOh,\u201d the big farmer said with a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s my mistake then.\u201d He\npicked up a crumb of crust from the plate and chewed it speculatively. \u201cI\u2019d swear it was a Damfine pie for all that. Maybe the Bentons got them some Damfine apples and don\u2019t know it.\u201d\nHis wife sniffed, then saw Chronicler sitting idle at his table and pulled her husband away.\nOld Cob watched them go, shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that woman needs in her life to make her a little happy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I hope she finds it before she pecks old Eli bloody.\u201d\nJake and Graham made vague grumbles of agreement.\n\u201cNice to see folks filling up the place.\u201d Old Cob looked at the red-haired man behind the bar. \u201cYou\u2019re a fine cook, Kote. And you\u2019ve got the best beer in twenty miles. All folk need is a bit of an excuse to stop by.\u201d\nOld Cob tapped the side of his nose speculatively. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said to the innkeeper. \u201cYou should bring in a singer or sommat on nights. Hell, even the Orrison boy can play a bit of his daddy\u2019s fiddle. I bet he\u2019d be glad to come in for the price of a couple drinks.\u201d He looked around at the inn. \u201cA little music is just what this place needs.\u201d\nThe innkeeper nodded. His expression was so easy and amiable it almost wasn\u2019t an expression at all. \u201cI expect you\u2019re right,\u201d Kote said. His voice was perfectly calm. It was a perfectly normal voice. It was colorless and clear as window glass.\nOld Cob opened his mouth, but before he could say anything else Bast rapped one knuckle hard on the bar. \u201cDrinks?\u201d he asked the men sitting at the bar. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you\u2019d all like a little something before we bring you out a bite to eat.\u201d\nThey did, and Bast bustled around behind the bar, pulling beer into mugs", "and pressing them into waiting hands. After a slow moment, the innkeeper swung silently into motion alongside his assistant, heading into the kitchen to fetch soup. And bread with butter. And cheese. And apples.", ""], "CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN": ["CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN\nInterlude\u2014The Hempen Verse\nCHRONICLER SMILED AS HE made his way to the bar. \u201cThat\u2019s a solid hour\u2019s work,\u201d he said proudly as he took a seat. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s anything left in the kitchen for me?\u201d\n\u201cOr any of that pie Eli mentioned?\u201d Jake asked hopefully.\n\u201cI want pie too,\u201d Bast said, sitting next to Jake, nursing a drink of his own. The innkeeper smiled, wiping his hands on his apron. \u201cI think I might have\nremembered to set one by, just in case you three came in later than the rest.\u201d Old Cob rubbed his hands together. \u201cCan\u2019t remember last time I had warm\napple pie,\u201d he said.\nThe innkeeper went back into the kitchen. He pulled the pie from the oven,\nsliced it, and laid the pieces neatly onto plates. By the time he carried them out toward the taproom he could hear raised voices in the other room.\n\u201cIt was too a demon, Jake,\u201d Old Cob was saying angrily. \u201cI told you last night, and I\u2019ll tell you again a hundred times. I\u2019m not a one to change my mind like other folk change their socks.\u201d He held up a finger. \u201cHe called up a demon and it bit this fellow and sucked out his juice like a plum. I heard it from a fella who knew a woman that seen it herself.That\u2019s why the constable and the deputies came and hauled him off. Meddling with dark forces is against the law over in Amary.\u201d\n\u201cI still say folk just thought it was a demon,\u201d Jake persisted. \u201cYou know how folk are.\u201d\n\u201cI know folk.\u201d Old Cob scowled. \u201cI\u2019ve been around longer than you Jacob. And I know my own story too.\u201d\nThere was a long moment of tense silence at the bar before Jake looked away. \u201cI was just sayin\u2019,\u201d he muttered.\nThe innkeeper slid a bowl of soup toward Chronicler. \u201cWhat\u2019s this then?\u201d\nThe scribe gave the innkeeper a sly look. \u201cCob\u2019s telling us about Kvothe\u2019s trial in Imre,\u201d he said, a hint of smugness in his voice. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember? He started the story last night but only made it halfway through.\u201d", "\u201cNow.\u201d Cob glared around, as if daring them to interrupt. \u201cIt was a tight spot. Kvothe knew if he was found guilty they\u2019d string him up and let him hang.\u201d Cob made a gesture to one side of his neck like he was holding a noose, tilting his head to the side.\n\u201cBut Kvothe had read a great many books when he was at the University, and he knew himself a trick.\u201d Old Cob stopped to take a forkful of pie and closed his eyes for a moment as he chewed. \u201cOh lord and lady,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cThat\u2019s a proper pie. I swear it\u2019s better than me mam used to make. She always skint on the sugar.\u201d He took another bite, a blissful expression spreading over his weathered face.\n\u201cSo Kvothe knew a trick?\u201d Chronicler prompted.\n\u201cWhat? Oh.\u201d Cob seemed to remember himself. \u201cRight. You see, there\u2019s two lines in the Book of the Path, and if you can read them out loud in the old Tema only priests know, then the iron law says you get treated like a priest. That means a Commonwealth judge can\u2019t do a damn thing to you. If you read those lines, your case has to be decided by the church courts.\u201d\nOld Cob took another bite of pie and chewed it slowly before swallowing. \u201cThose two lines are called the hempen verse, because if you know them, you can keep yourself from getting strung up. The church courts can\u2019t hang a man, you see.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are the lines?\u201d Bast asked.\n\u201cI dearly wish I knew,\u201d Old Cob said mournfully. \u201cBut I don\u2019t speak Tema. Kvothe didn\u2019t know it himself. But he memorized the verse ahead of time. Then he pretended to read it and the Commonwealth court had to let him go.\n\u201cKvothe knew he had two days until a Tehlin Justice could make it all the way to Amary. So he set about learning Tema. He read books and practiced for a whole day and a whole night. And he was so powerful smart that at the end of his studying he could speak Tema better than most folk who been doing it their whole lives.\n\u201cThen, on the second day before the Justice showed up, Kvothe mixed himself a potion. It was made out of honey, and a special stone you find in a snake\u2019s brain, and a plant that only grows at the bottom of the sea. When he drank the potion, it made his voice so sweet anyone who listened couldn\u2019t help but agree with anything he said.\n\u201cSo when the Justice finally showed up, the whole trial only took fifteen minutes,\u201d Cob said, chuckling. \u201cKvothe gave a fine speech in perfect Tema,", "everyone agreed with him, and they all went home.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he lived happily ever after,\u201d the red-haired man said softly from\nbehind the bar.\nThings were quiet at the bar. Outside the air was dry and hot, full of dust and the smell of chaff. The sunlight was hard and bright as a bar of gold.\nInside the Waystone it was dim and cool. The men had just finished the last slow bites of their pie, and there was still a little beer in their mugs. So they sat for a little while longer, slouching at the bar with the guilty air of men too proud to be properly lazy.\n\u201cI never much cared for Kvothe stories myself,\u201d the innkeeper said matter- of-factly as he gathered up everyone\u2019s plates.\nOld Cob looked up from his beer. \u201cThat so?\u201d\nThe innkeeper shrugged. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to have a story with magic, I\u2019d like it to have a proper wizard in it. Someone like Taborlin the Great, or Serapha, or The Chronicler.\u201d\nAt the end of the bar, the scribe didn\u2019t choke or startle. He did pause for half a second though, before lowering his spoon back into his second bowl of soup.\nThe room went comfortably quiet again as the innkeeper gathered up the last of the empty plates and turned toward the kitchen. But before he could get through the doorway, Graham spoke up. \u201cThe Chronicler?\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t ever heard of him.\u201d\nThe innkeeper turned back, surprised. \u201cYou haven\u2019t?\u201d\nGraham shook his head.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you have,\u201d the innkeeper said. \u201cHe carries around a great book,\nand whatever he writes down in that book comes true.\u201d He looked at all of them expectantly. Jake shook his head too.\nThe innkeeper turned to the scribe at the end of the bar, who was keeping his attention on his food. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard of him, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Kote said. \u201cThey call him Lord of Stories, and if he learns one of your secrets he can write whatever he wants about you in his book.\u201d He looked at the scribe. \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever heard of him?\u201d\nChronicler dropped his eyes and shook his head. He dipped the crust of his\n \nbread in his soup and ate it without speaking.\nThe innkeeper looked surprised. \u201cWhen I was growing up, I liked The\nChronicler more than Taborlin or any of the rest. He\u2019s got a bit of Faerie blood in him, and it\u2019s made him sharper than a normal man. He can see for a hundred miles on a cloudy day and hear a whisper through a thick oak door. He can track a mouse through a forest on a moonless night.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of him,\u201d Bast said eagerly. \u201cHis sword is named Sheave, and the blade is made of a single piece of paper. It\u2019s light as a feather, but so sharp that if he cuts you, you see the blood before you even feel it.\u201d\nThe innkeeper nodded. \u201cAnd if he learns your name, he can write it on the blade of the sword and use it to kill you from a thousand miles away.\u201d\n\u201cBut he\u2019s got to write it in his own blood,\u201d Bast added. \u201cAnd there\u2019s only so much space on the sword. He\u2019s already written seventeen names on it, so there\u2019s not that much room left.\u201d\n\u201cHe used to be a member of the high king\u2019s court in Modeg,\u201d Kote said. \u201cBut he fell in love with the high king\u2019s daughter.\u201d\nGraham and Old Cob were nodding now. This was familiar territory.\nKote continued, \u201cWhen Chronicler asked to marry her, the high king was angry. So he gave Chronicler a task to prove he was worthy. . . .\u201d The innkeeper paused dramatically. \u201cChronicler can only marry her if he finds something more precious than the princess and brings it back to the high king.\u201d\nGraham made an appreciative noise. \u201cThat\u2019s a pisser of a task. What\u2019s a man to do? You can\u2019t bring something back and say, \u2018Here, this is worth more than your little girl. . . .\u2019 \u201d\nThe innkeeper gave a grave nod. \u201cSo Chronicler wanders the world looking for ancient treasures and old magics, hoping to find something he can bring back to the king.\u201d\n\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he just write about the king in his magic book?\u201d Jake asked. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he write down, \u2018And then the king stopped being a bastard and let us get married already.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cBecause he doesn\u2019t know any of the king\u2019s secrets,\u201d the innkeeper explained. \u201cAnd the high king of Modeg knows some magic and can protect himself. Most importantly, he knows Chronicler\u2019s weaknesses. He knows if you trick Chronicler into drinking ink, he has to do the next three favors you ask of him. And more important, he knows Chronicler can\u2019t control you if you have your name hidden away somewhere safe. The high king\u2019s name is", "written in a book of glass, hidden in a box of copper. And that box is locked away in a great iron chest where nobody can touch it.\u201d\nThere was a moment\u2019s pause as everyone considered this. Then Old Cob began nodding thoughtfully. \u201cThat last bit tickled my memory,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cI seem to remember a story about this Chronicler fellow going to look for a magic fruit. Whoever ate the fruit would suddenly know the names of all things, and he\u2019d have powers like Taborlin the Great.\u201d\nThe innkeeper rubbed his chin, nodding slowly. \u201cI think I heard that one too,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it was a long time ago, and I can\u2019t say as I remember all the details. . . .\u201d\n\u201cAh well,\u201d Old Cob said as he drank the last of his beer and knocked down his mug. \u201cNothing to be \u2019shamed of, Kote. Some folk are good at remembering and some ain\u2019t. You make a fine pie, but we all know who the storyteller is around here.\u201d\nOld Cob climbed stiffly down off his stool and motioned to Graham and Jake. \u201cCome on then, we can walk together as far as Byres\u2019 place. I\u2019ll tell you two all about it. Now this Chronicler, he\u2019s tall and pale, and thin as a rail, with hair as black as ink\u2014\u201d\nThe door of the Waystone Inn banged closed.\n\u201cWhat in God\u2019s name was that all about?\u201d Chronicler demanded. Kvothe looked sideways at Chronicler. He smiled a small, sharp smile.\n\u201cHow does it feel,\u201d he asked, \u201cknowing people out there are telling stories about you?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not telling stories about me!\u201d Chronicler said. \u201cThey\u2019re just a bunch of nonsense.\u201d\n\u201cNot nonsense,\u201d Kvothe said, seeming a little bit offended. \u201cIt might not be true, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s nonsense.\u201d He looked at Bast. \u201cI liked the paper sword.\u201d\nBast beamed. \u201cThe king\u2019s task was a nice touch, Reshi. I don\u2019t know about the Faerie blood though.\u201d\n\u201cDemon blood would have been too sinister,\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cHe needed a twist.\u201d\n\u201cAt least I won\u2019t have to hear him tell it,\u201d Chronicler said sullenly, prodding a bit of potato with his spoon.\nKvothe looked up, then chuckled darkly. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand, do you? A fresh story like that on a harvest day? They\u2019ll be at it like a child with a new toy. Old Cob will talk about Chronicler to a dozen people while they\u2019re", "bucking hay and drinking water in the shade. Tonight at Shep\u2019s wake, folk from ten towns will hear about the Lord of Stories. It will spread like a fire in a field.\u201d\nChronicler looked back and forth between the two of them, his expression vaguely horrified. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gift,\u201d Kvothe said.\n\u201cYou think I want this?\u201d Chronicler said incredulously. \u201cFame?\u201d\n\u201cNot fame,\u201d Kvothe said grimly. \u201cPerspective. You go rummaging around\nin other people\u2019s lives. You hear rumors and go digging for the painful truth beneath the lovely lies. You believe you have a right to these things. But you don\u2019t.\u201d He looked hard at the scribe. \u201cWhen someone tells you a piece of their life, they\u2019re giving you a gift, not granting you your due.\u201d\nKvothe wiped his hands on the clean linen cloth. \u201cI\u2019m giving you my story with all the grubby truths intact. All my mistakes and idiocies laid out naked in the light. If I decide to pass over some small piece because it bores me, I\u2019m well within my rights. I won\u2019t be goaded into changing my mind by some farmer\u2019s tale. I\u2019m not an idiot.\u201d\nChronicler looked down at his soup. \u201cIt was a little heavy-handed, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cIt was,\u201d Kvothe said.\nChronicler looked up with a sigh and gave a small, embarrassed smile. \u201cWell. You can\u2019t blame me for trying.\u201d\n\u201cI can, actually,\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cBut I believe I\u2019ve made my point. And for what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m sorry for any trouble that might cause you.\u201d He gestured to the door and the departed farmers. \u201cI might have overreacted a bit. I\u2019ve never responded well to manipulation.\u201d\nKvothe stepped out from behind the bar, heading to the table near the hearth. \u201cCome on now, both of you. The trial itself was tedious business. But it had important repercussions.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT": ["CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT\nA Significant Absence\nI WENT THROUGH THE ADMISSIONS lottery and was lucky enough to draw a late slot. I was glad for the extra time, as my trial had left me little opportunity to study for my exams.\nStill, I wasn\u2019t terribly worried. I had time to study and free access to the Archives. What\u2019s more, for the first time since I\u2019d come to the University, I wasn\u2019t a pauper. I had thirteen talents in my purse. Even after I paid Devi the interest on her loan, I would easily have enough for tuition.\nBest of all, the long hours spent searching for the gram had taught me a great deal about the Archives. While I might not know as much as an experienced scriv, I was familiar with many of her hidden corners and quiet secrets. So while I studied, I also allowed myself the freedom to do other reading while I prepared for admissions.\nI closed the book I\u2019d been poring over. A well-written, comprehensive history of the Aturan church. It was as useless as all the rest.\nWilem looked up as my book thumped shut. \u201cNothing?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cLess than nothing,\u201d I said.\nThe two of us were studying in one of the fourth-floor reading holes, much\nsmaller than our customary place on the third floor, but given how close we were to admissions, we\u2019d been lucky to find a private room at all.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you let it go?\u201d Wil suggested. \u201cYou\u2019ve been beating this Amyr thing like a dead horse for what, two span?\u201d\nI nodded, not wanting to admit my research into the Amyr had actually started long before our bet had taken us to Puppet.\n\u201cAnd what have you found so far?\u201d\n\u201cShelves of books,\u201d I said. \u201cDozens of stories. Mentions in a hundred\n \nhistories.\u201d\nHe gave me a level look. \u201cAnd this wealth of information irritates you.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cThe lack of information troubles me. There isn\u2019t any solid\ninformation about the Amyr in any of these books.\u201d\n\u201cNone?\u201d Wilem said skeptically.\n\u201cOh, every historian in the last three hundred years talks about them,\u201d I\nsaid. \u201cThey speculate on how the Amyr influenced the decline of the empire. Philosophers talk about the ethical ramifications of their actions.\u201d I gestured to the books. \u201cThat tells me what people think about the Amyr. It doesn\u2019t tell me anything about the Amyr themselves.\u201d\nWilem frowned at my stack of books. \u201cIt can\u2019t all be historians and philosophers.\u201d\n\u201cThere are stories too,\u201d I said. \u201cEarly on there are stories about the great wrongs they righted. Later you get stories about the terrible things they did. An Amyr in Renere kills a corrupt judge. Another in Junpui puts down a peasant uprising. A third in Melithi poisons half the town\u2019s nobility.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that isn\u2019t solid information?\u201d Wilem asked.\n\u201cThey\u2019re soft stories,\u201d I said. \u201cSecond- or third-hand. Three-quarters of them are simply hearsay. I can\u2019t find corroborating evidence for them anywhere. Why can\u2019t I find any mention of the corrupt judge in the church records? His name should be recorded in every case he tried. What was the date of this peasant uprising, and why can\u2019t I find it mentioned in any of the other histories?\u201d\n\u201cIt was three hundred years ago,\u201d Wilem said reproachfully. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect all those little details to survive.\u201d\n\u201cI expect some of the little details to survive. You know how obsessive the Tehlins are about their records,\u201d I said. \u201cWe have a thousand years of court documents from a hundred different cities squirreled away down in sub-two. Whole rooms full . . .\u201d\nI waved my hands dismissively. \u201cBut fine, let\u2019s abandon the small details. There are huge questions I can\u2019t find any answers for. When was the Order Amyr founded? How many Amyr were there? Who paid them, and how much? Where did that money come from? Where were they trained? How did they come to be a part of the Tehlin church?\u201d\n\u201cFeltemi Reis answered that,\u201d Wilem said. \u201cThey grew out of the tradition of the mendicant judges.\u201d\nI picked up a book at random and thumped it onto the table in front of him.", "\u201cFind me one bit of proof to support that theory. Find me one record that shows a mendicant judge being promoted into the ranks of the Amyr. Show me one record of an Amyr being employed by a court. Find me one church document that shows an Amyr presiding over a case.\u201d I crossed my arms in front of my chest belligerently. \u201cGo on, I\u2019ll wait.\u201d\nWilem ignored the book. \u201cMaybe there weren\u2019t as many Amyr as people assume. Perhaps there were only a few of them and their reputation grew out of their control.\u201d He gave me a pointed look. \u201cYou should understand how that works.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cThis is a significant absence. Sometimes finding nothing can be finding something.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re starting to sound like Elodin,\u201d Wilem said.\nI frowned at him but decided not to rise to the bait. \u201cNo, listen for a minute. Why would there be so little factual information about the Amyr? There are only three possibilities.\u201d\nI held up fingers to mark them off. \u201cOne: nothing was written down. I think we can safely discard that. They were too important to be so entirely neglected by historians, clerks, and the obsessive documentation of the church.\u201d I tucked that finger away.\n\u201cTwo. By an odd chance, copies of the books that do have this information have simply never made their way here to the Archives. But that\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s impossible to think that over all the years nothing on the subject has ended up in the largest library in the world.\u201d I folded down the second finger.\n\u201cThree.\u201d I pointed with the remaining finger. \u201cSomeone has removed this information, altered it, or destroyed it.\u201d\nWilem frowned. \u201cWho would do that?\u201d\n\u201cWho indeed?\u201d I said, \u201cWho would benefit most from the destruction of the information of the Amyr?\u201d I hesitated, letting the tension build. \u201cWho else but the Amyr themselves?\u201d\nI had expected him to dismiss my idea, but he didn\u2019t. \u201cAn interesting thought,\u201d Wilem said. \u201cBut why assume the Amyr are behind it? It is much more sensible to think the church itself is responsible. Certainly the Tehlins would like nothing better than to quietly erase the Amyr\u2019s atrocities.\u201d\n\u201cTrue,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut the church isn\u2019t very strong here in the Commonwealth. And these books come from all over the world. A Cealdish historian wouldn\u2019t have any compunctions about writing a history of the Amyr.\u201d", "\u201cA Cealdish historian would have very little interest in writing the history of a heretic branch of a pagan church,\u201d Wilem pointed out. \u201cBesides, how could a discredited handful of Amyr do something the church itself could not achieve?\u201d\nI leaned forward. \u201cI think the Amyr are far older than the Tehlin church,\u201d I said. \u201cDuring the time of the Aturan Empire, a great deal of their public strength was with the church, but they were more than just a group of wandering justices.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what leads you to this belief?\u201d Wil said. From his expression I could see I was losing Wilem\u2019s support rather than gaining it.\nA piece of ancient pottery, I thought. A story I heard from an old man in Tarbean. I know it because of something the Chandrian let slip after they killed everyone I ever knew.\nI sighed and shook my head, knowing how crazy I would sound if I told the truth. That was why I scoured the Archives. I needed some tangible evidence to support my theory, something that wouldn\u2019t make me a laughingstock.\n\u201cI found copies of the court documents from the time the Amyr were denounced,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you know how many Amyr they put on trial in Tarbean?\u201d\nWil shrugged.\nI held up a single finger. \u201cOne. One Amyr in all of Tarbean. And the clerk writing the transcript of the trial made it clear the man they put on trial was a simpleton who didn\u2019t understand what was going on.\u201d\nI still saw doubt on Wilem\u2019s face. \u201cJust think on it,\u201d I pleaded. \u201cThe scraps I\u2019ve found suggest there were at least three thousand Amyr in the empire before they were disbanded. Three thousand highly trained, heavily armed, wealthy men and women absolutely devoted to the greater good.\n\u201cThen one day the church denounces them, disbands their entire order, and confiscates their property.\u201d I snapped my fingers. \u201cAnd three thousand deadly, justice-obsessed fanatics just disappear? They roll over and decide to let someone else take care of the greater good for a while? No protest? No resistance? Nothing?\u201d\nI gave him a hard look and shook my head firmly. \u201cNo. That goes against human nature. Besides, I haven\u2019t found one record of a member of the Amyr being brought before the church\u2019s justice. Not one. Is it so outrageous to think they might have decided to go underground, to continue their work in a", "more secret way?\n\u201cAnd if that\u2019s reasonable,\u201d I continued before he could interrupt. \u201cDoesn\u2019t\nit also make sense they might try to preserve their secrecy by carefully pruning histories over the last three hundred years?\u201d\nThere was a long pause.\nWilem didn\u2019t dismiss it out of hand. \u201cAn interesting theory,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cBut it leads me to one last question.\u201d He eyed me seriously. \u201cHave you been drinking?\u201d\nI slumped in my chair. \u201cNo.\u201d\nHe came to his feet. \u201cThen you should start. You have been spending too much time with all these books. You need to wash the dust from your brains.\u201d\nSo we went for a drink, but I still harbored my suspicions. I bounced the idea off Simmon when I next had the chance. He accepted it more easily than Wilem had. Which isn\u2019t to say he believed me, just that he accepted the possibility. He said I should mention it to Lorren.\nI didn\u2019t. The blank-faced Master Archivist still made me nervous, and I avoided him at every opportunity for fear I might give him some excuse to ban me from the Archives. The last thing I wanted to do was suggest his precious Archives had been slowly pruned over the last three hundred years.", "CHAPTER FORTY- NINE\nThe Ignorant Edema\nI SAW ELXA DAL RAISE a hand in greeting from across the courtyard. \u201cKvothe!\u201d He smiled warmly. \u201cThe very fellow I was hoping to see! Could I borrow a moment of your time?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said. While I liked Master Dal, we hadn\u2019t had much contact together outside the lecture hall. \u201cCould I buy you a drink, or a bite of lunch? I\u2019ve been meaning to thank you more properly for speaking on my behalf at the trial, but I\u2019ve been busy. . . .\u201d\n\u201cAs have I,\u201d Dal said. \u201cI\u2019ve actually been meaning to talk to you for days, but time keeps getting away from me.\u201d He looked around. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t turn down a bit of lunch, but I should probably forego the drink. I have admissions to oversee in less than an hour.\u201d\nWe stepped into the White Hart. I\u2019d barely even seen the inside of the place, as it was far too rich for the likes of me.\nElxa Dal was recognizable in his dark master\u2019s robes, and the host fawned a bit as he led the two of us to a private table. Dal seemed perfectly at his ease as he took a seat, but I was increasingly nervous. I couldn\u2019t imagine why the Master Sympathist would seek me out for a conversation.\n\u201cWhat can I bring you?\u201d asked the tall, thin man as soon as we were in our chairs. \u201cDrinks? A selection of cheeses? We have a delightful lemoned trout as well.\u201d\n\u201cThe trout and cheeses would do nicely,\u201d Dal said.\nThe host turned to me. \u201cAnd yourself?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll try the trout as well,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWonderful,\u201d he said, rubbing his hands together in anticipation. \u201cAnd to\ndrink?\u201d\n\u201cCider,\u201d I said.\n\u201cDo you have any Fallows red?\u201d Dal asked hesitantly.\n\u201cWe do,\u201d said the host. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a lovely year, too, if I do say so myself.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll have a cup,\u201d Dal said, glancing at me. \u201cOne cup shouldn\u2019t alter my", "judgment too badly.\u201d\nThe host hurried away, leaving me alone at the table with Elxa Dal. It felt\nodd sitting across the table from him. I shifted nervously in my seat.\n\u201cSo how are things with you?\u201d Dal asked conversationally.\n\u201cPassing fair,\u201d I said.\u201cIt was a good term with the exception of . . .\u201d I made\na gesture toward Imre.\nDal gave a humorless chuckle. \u201cThat was a brush with the old days, wasn\u2019t\nit?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cConsortation with Demons. Good lord.\u201d\nThe host returned with our drinks and left without a word.\nMaster Dal picked up his wide clay cup and held it in the air. \u201cTo not\ngetting burned alive by superstitious folk,\u201d he said.\nI smiled despite my discomfiture and raised my wooden mug. \u201cA fine\ntradition.\u201d\nWe both drank, Dal sighing appreciatively at the wine.\nDal looked at me across the table. \u201cSo tell me,\u201d he said. \u201cHave you ever\nconsidered what you\u2019re going to do with yourself when you\u2019re done here? After you have your guilder, I mean.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t thought of it that much,\u201d I admitted honestly. \u201cIt seems such a long way off.\u201d\n\u201cAt the rate you\u2019re rising through the ranks it might not be so long at that. Already a Re\u2019lar at . . . how old are you again?\u201d\n\u201cSeventeen,\u201d I lied smoothly. I was sensitive about my age. Many students were nearly twenty before they enrolled in the University, let alone joined the Arcanum.\n\u201cSeventeen,\u201d Dal mused softly. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to forget that. You carry yourself so tall.\u201d His eyes got a faraway look in them. \u201cLord and lady, I was a mess at seventeen. My studies, trying to sort out my place in the world. Women . . .\u201d He shook his head slowly. \u201cIt gets better, you know. Give it three or four years and everything settles down a bit.\u201d\nHe raised his clay cup to me briefly before taking another drink. \u201cNot that you seem to be having much trouble. Re\u2019lar at seventeen. Quite a mark of distinction.\u201d\nI flushed a bit, not knowing what to say.\nThe host returned and began laying dishes on the table. A small board with an array of different sliced cheeses. A bowl with small, toasted pieces of bread. A bowl of strawberry preserves. A bowl of blueberry jam. A small dish of shelled walnuts.", "Dal picked up a small piece of bread and a slice of crumbling white cheese. \u201cYou\u2019re quite the sympathist,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are any number of opportunities out there for a person as skilled as yourself.\u201d\nI spread a bit of strawberry across a piece of cheese and toast, then put it into my mouth to give myself time to think. Was Dal implying he wanted me to focus more on my study of sympathy? Was he implying he wanted to sponsor me to El\u2019the?\nElodin had sponsored my elevation to Re\u2019lar, but I knew these things changed. Masters occasionally fought over particularly promising students. Mola, for example, had been a scriv before Arwyl stole her away into the Medica.\n\u201cI do enjoy my study of sympathy quite a bit,\u201d I said carefully.\n\u201cThat\u2019s abundantly clear,\u201d Dal said with a smile. \u201cSome of your classmates wish you enjoyed it a little less, I can assure you of that.\u201d He ate another piece of cheese, then continued, \u201cThat said, it is possible to overdo it. Didn\u2019t Teccam say \u2018Too much study harms the student?\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cErtram the Wiser, actually.\u201d I said. It had been in one of the books Master Lorren had set aside for Re\u2019lar to study this term.\n\u201cIt\u2019s true at any rate,\u201d he said. \u201cYou might want to consider taking a term off to relax a bit. Travel a little, get some sun.\u201d He took another drink. \u201cIt\u2019s not good to see one of the Edema Ruh without a tan.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t know what to say to that. The thought of taking a holiday from the University had never occurred to me. Where would I possibly go?\nThe host arrived with plates of fish, steaming and smelling of lemon and butter. For a while both of us concentrated on our food. I was glad for an excuse not to talk. Why would Dal compliment me on my studies, then encourage me to leave?\nAfter a while Elxa Dal gave a contented sigh and pushed back his plate. \u201cLet me tell you a little story,\u201d he said. \u201cA story I like to call \u2018The Ignorant Edema.\u2019 \u201d\nI looked up at that, slowly chewing my mouthful of fish. I kept my expression carefully composed.\nHe arched an eyebrow, as if waiting to see if I had anything to say.\nWhen I didn\u2019t, he continued. \u201cOnce there was a learned arcanist. He knew all of sympathy and sygaldry and alchemy. He had ten dozen names tucked neatly into his head, spoke eight languages, and had exemplary penmanship. Really, the only thing that kept him from being a master was poor timing and", "a certain lack of social grace.\u201d\nDal took a sip of wine. \u201cSo this fellow went chasing the wind for a while,\nhoping to find his fortune out in the wide world. And while he was on the road to Tinu\u00eb, he came to a lake he needed to cross.\u201d\nDal smiled broadly. \u201cLuckily, there was an Edema boatman who offered to ferry him to the other side. The arcanist, seeing the trip would take several hours, tried to start a conversation.\n\u201c \u2018What do you think,\u2019 he asked the boatman, \u2018about Teccam\u2019s theory of energy as an elemental substance rather than a material property?\u2019\n\u201cThe boatman replied he\u2019d never thought on it at all.What\u2019s more, he had no plans to.\n\u201c \u2018Surely your education included Teccam\u2019s Theophany?\u2019 the arcanist asked.\n\u201c \u2018I never had what you might call an education, y\u2019honor,\u2019 the boatman said. \u2018And I wouldn\u2019t know this Teccam of yours if he showed up selling needles to m\u2019wife.\u2019\n\u201cCurious, the arcanist asked a few questions and the Edema admitted he didn\u2019t know who Feltemi Reis was, or what a gearwin did. The arcanist continued for a long hour, first out of curiosity, then with dismay. The final straw came when he discovered the boatman couldn\u2019t even read or write.\n\u201c \u2018Really sir,\u2019 the arcanist said, appalled. \u2018It is every man\u2019s job to improve himself. A man without the benefits of education is hardly more than an animal.\u2019 \u201d\nDal grinned. \u201cWell, as you can guess, the conversation didn\u2019t go very far after that. They rode for the next hour in a tense silence, but just as the far shore was coming into sight a storm blew up. Waves started to lash the little boat, making the timbers creak and groan.\n\u201cThe Edema took a hard look at the clouds and said, \u2018It\u2019ll be true bad in five minutes, then sommat worse afore it clears. This boat of mine won\u2019t hold together through it all. We\u2019re gonnta have to swim the last little bit.\u2019 And with this the ferryman takes off his shirt and begins to tie it around his waist.\n\u201c \u2018But I don\u2019t know how to swim,\u2019 says the arcanist.\u201d\nDal drank off the last of his wine, turned the cup upside down, and set it firmly on the tabletop. There was a moment of expectant silence as he watched me, a vaguely self-satisfied expression on his face.\n\u201cNot a bad story,\u201d I admitted. \u201cThe Ruh\u2019s accent was a little over the top.\u201d Dal bent at the waist in a quick, mocking bow. \u201cI will take it under", "consideration,\u201d he said, then raised one finger and gave me a conspiratorial look. \u201cNot only is my story designed to delight and entertain, but there is a kernel of truth hidden within, where only the cleverest student might find it.\u201d His expression turned mysterious. \u201cAll the truth in the world is held in stories, you know.\u201d\nLater that evening, I related the encounter to my friends while playing cards at Anker\u2019s.\n\u201cHe\u2019s giving you a hint, thickwit,\u201d Manet said irritably. The cards had been against us all night, and we were five hands behind. \u201cYou just refuse to hear it.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s hinting I should leave off studying sympathy for a term?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Manet snapped. \u201cHe\u2019s telling you what I\u2019ve told you twice already. You\u2019re a king-high idiot if you go through admissions this term.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy?\u201d\nManet set his cards down with profound calm. \u201cKvothe. You\u2019re a clever boy, but you have a world of trouble listening to things you don\u2019t want to hear.\u201d He looked left then right at Wilem and Simmon. \u201cCan you try telling him?\u201d\n\u201cTake a term off,\u201d Wilem said without looking up from his cards. Then added, \u201cThickwit.\u201d\n\u201cYou really have to,\u201d Sim said earnestly. \u201cEveryone\u2019s still talking about the trial. It\u2019s all anyone is talking about.\u201d\n\u201cThe trial?\u201d I laughed. \u201cThat was more than a span ago. They\u2019re talking about how I was found completely innocent. Exonerated in the eyes of the iron law and merciful Tehlu himself.\u201d\nManet snorted loudly, lowering his cards. \u201cIt would have been better if you\u2019d been guilty in a quiet way, rather than be innocent so loud.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cDo you know how long it\u2019s been since an arcanist was brought up on charges of Consortation?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I admitted.\n\u201cNeither do I,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich means it\u2019s been a long, long while. You\u2019re innocent. Lovely for you. But the trial has given the University a great shining black eye. It\u2019s reminded folk that while you might not deserve\n \nburning, some arcanists might.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou can be certain the masters are uniformly wet-cat-mad about that.\u201d\n\u201cSome students aren\u2019t too pleased either,\u201d Wil added darkly.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t my fault there was a trial!\u201d I protested, then backed up a bit. \u201cNot entirely. Ambrose stirred this up. He was backstage during the whole thing, laughing up his sleeve.\u201d\n\u201cEven so,\u201d Wil said. \u201cAmbrose is sensible enough to avoid admissions this term.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, surprised. \u201cHe\u2019s not going through admissions?\u201d\n\u201cHe is not,\u201d Wilem said. \u201cHe left for home two days ago.\u201d\n\u201cBut there was nothing to connect him to the trial,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy would he\nleave?\u201d\n\u201cBecause the masters are not idiots,\u201d Manet said. \u201cThe two of you have\nbeen snapping at each other like mad dogs since you first met.\u201d He tapped his lips thoughtfully, his expression full of exaggerated innocence. \u201cSay, that reminds me. Whatever were you doing at the Golden Pony the night Ambrose\u2019s room caught fire?\u201d\n\u201cPlaying cards,\u201d I said.\n\u201cOf course you were,\u201d Manet said, his tone thick with sarcasm. \u201cThe two of you have been throwing rocks at each other for a full year, and one of them has finally hit the hornet\u2019s nest. The only sensible thing to do is run off to a safe distance and wait \u2019til the buzzing stops.\u201d\nSimmon cleared his throat timidly. \u201cI hate to join the chorus,\u201d he said apologetically. \u201cBut rumor has gotten around you were seen having lunch with Sleat.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cAnd Fela told me she\u2019d heard you were . . . um . . . courting Devi.\u201d\n\u201cYou know that\u2019s not true about Devi,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve just been visiting her in order to keep the peace. She was half an inch away from wanting to eat my liver for a while there. And I only had one conversation with Sleat. It was barely fifteen minutes long.\u201d\n\u201cDevi?\u201d Manet exclaimed with dismay. \u201cDevi and Sleat? One expelled and the other the next best thing?\u201d He threw down his cards. \u201cWhy would you be seen with those people? Why am I even being seen with you?\u201d\n\u201cOh come now.\u201d I looked back and forth between Wil and Sim. \u201cIt\u2019s that bad?\u201d\nWilem set down his cards. \u201cI predict,\u201d he said calmly, \u201cthat if you go through admissions, you will receive a tuition of at least thirty-five talents.\u201d", "He looked back and forth between Sim and Manet. \u201cI will wager a full gold mark to this effect. Does anyone care to take my bet?\u201d\nNeither of them took him up on his offer.\nI felt a desperate sinking in my stomach. \u201cBut this can\u2019t ...\u201d I said. \u201cThis . . .\u201d\nSim put his cards down as well, the grim expression out of place on his friendly face. \u201cKvothe,\u201d he said formally. \u201cI am telling you three times. Take a term away.\u201d\nEventually I realized my friends were telling me the truth. Unfortunately, this left me entirely at loose ends. I had no exams to study for, and starting another project in the Fishery would be nothing but foolishness. Even the thought of searching the Archives for information on the Chandrian or the Amyr had little appeal. I had searched so long and found so little.\nI toyed with the idea of searching elsewhere. There are other libraries, of course. Every noble house has at least a modest collection containing household accounts and histories of their lands and family. Most churches had extensive records going back hundreds of years, detailing trials, marriages, and dispositions. The same was true of any sizable city. The Amyr couldn\u2019t have destroyed every trace of their existence.\nThe research itself wouldn\u2019t be the hard part.The hard part would be gaining access to the libraries in the first place. I could hardly show up in Renere dressed in rags and road dust, asking to thumb through the palace archives.\nThis was another instance in which a patron would have been invaluable. A patron could write me a letter of introduction that would open all manner of doors for me. What\u2019s more, with a patron\u2019s backing, I could make a decent living for myself as I traveled. Many small towns wouldn\u2019t even let you play at the local inn without a writ of patronage.\nThe University had been the center of my life for a solid year. Now, confronted with the necessity of leaving, I was utterly at sea, with no idea of what I could do with myself.\n \nCHAPTER FIFTY\nChasing the Wind\nI GAVE MY ADMISSIONS TILE to Fela, telling her I hoped it brought her luck. And so the winter term came to an end.\nSuddenly three-quarters of my life simply disappeared. I had no classes to occupy my time, no shifts in the Medica to fill. I could no longer check out materials from Stocks, use tools in the Fishery, or enter the Archives.\nAt first it wasn\u2019t so bad. The midwinter pageantry was wonderfully distracting, and without the worry of work and study I was free to enjoy myself and spend time in the company of my friends.\nThen spring term started. My friends were still there, but they were busy with their own studies. I found myself crossing the river more and more. Denna was still nowhere to be found, but Deoch and Stanchion were always willing to share a drink and some idle gossip.\nThrepe was there too, and while he occasionally pressed me to attend a dinner at his house, I could tell his heart wasn\u2019t in it. My trial hadn\u2019t pleased people on this side of the river either, and they were still telling stories about it. I wouldn\u2019t be welcome in any respectable social circle for a great long time, if ever.\nI toyed with the idea of leaving the University. I knew people would forget about the trial more quickly if I wasn\u2019t around. But where would I go? The only thought that came to mind was heading off to Yll with the vain hope of finding Denna. But I knew that was nothing but foolishness.\nSince I didn\u2019t need to save money for tuition, I went to repay Devi. But for the first time ever, I wasn\u2019t able to find her. Over the course of several days I grew increasingly nervous. I even slid several apologetic notes under her door until I heard from Mola that she was taking a holiday and would be returning soon.\n \nDays passed. And I sat idle as winter slowly withdrew from the University. Frost left the corners of windowpanes, drifts of snow dwindled, and trees began to show their first greening buds. Eventually Simmon caught his first glimpse of bare leg beneath a flowing dress and declared spring had officially arrived.\nOne afternoon as I sat drinking metheglin with Stanchion, Threpe came through the door practically bubbling with excitement. He whisked me off to a private table on the second tier, looking ready to burst with whatever news he was carrying.\nThrepe folded his hands on the tabletop. \u201cSince we haven\u2019t had much luck finding you a local patron, I started casting my nets farther afield. It\u2019s nice to have a local patron. But if you have the support of a properly influential lord, it hardly matters where he lives.\u201d\nI nodded. My troupe had ranged all over the four corners under the protection of Lord Greyfallow\u2019s name.\nThrepe grinned. \u201cHave you ever been to Vintas?\u201d\n\u201cPossibly,\u201d I said. Then seeing his puzzled look, I explained, \u201cI traveled quite a bit when I was young. I can\u2019t remember if we ever made it that far east.\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cDo you know who the Maer Alveron is?\u201d\nI did, but I could tell Threpe was bursting to tell me himself. \u201cI seem to remember something . . .\u201d I said vaguely.\nThrepe grinned. \u201cYou know the expression \u2018rich as the King of Vint?\u2019 \u201d I nodded.\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s him. His great-great-grandfathers were the kings of Vint,\nback before the empire stomped in, converting everyone to the iron law and the Book of the Path. If not for a few quirks of fate a dozen generations back, Alveron would be the royal family of Vintas, not the Calanthis, and my friend the Maer would be the king.\u201d\n\u201cYour friend?\u201d I said appreciatively. \u201cYou know Maer Alveron?\u201d\nThrepe made a vacillating gesture.\u201cFriend may be stretching things a little,\u201d he admitted. \u201cWe\u2019ve been corresponding for some years, exchanging news from our different corners of the world, doing each other a favor or two. It would be more appropriate to say we\u2019re acquainted.\u201d\n\u201cAn impressive acquaintance. What is he like?\u201d\n\u201cHis letters are quite polite. Never a bit snobby even though he does stand quite a good rank above me,\u201d Threpe said modestly. \u201cHe\u2019s every bit a king", "except for the title and crown, you know. When Vintas formed, his family refused to surrender any of their plenary powers. That means the Maer has the authority to do most anything King Roderic himself can do: grant titles, raise an army, coin money, levy taxes\u2014\u201d\nThrepe shook his head sharply. \u201cAh, I forget what I\u2019m doing,\u201d he said as he began to search his pockets. \u201cI received a letter from him only yesterday.\u201d He produced a piece of paper, unfolded it, then cleared his throat and read:\nI know you are knee-deep in poets and musicians out there, and I am rather in need of a young man who is good with words. I cannot find anyone to suit me here in Severen. And, everything said, I would prefer the best.\nHe should be good with words above all, perhaps a musician of some sort. After that, I would desire him to be clever, well-spoken, mannerly, educated, and discreet. On reading this list you may see why I have had no luck finding such a one for myself. If you happen to know a man of this rare sort, encourage him to call on me.\nI would tell you what use I intend to put him to, but the matter is of a private nature. . . .\nThrepe studied the letter for a moment or two. \u201cIt goes on for a bit. Then he says, \u2018As to the matter I mentioned before, I am in some haste. If there is no one suitable in Imre, please send me a letter by post. If you happen to send someone my way, encourage him to make speed.\u2019 \u201d Threpe\u2019s eyes scanned the paper for a moment more, his lips moving silently. \u201cThat\u2019s all of it,\u201d he said finally, and tucked it back into a pocket. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\n\u201cYou do me a great\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes.\u201d He waved a hand impatiently. \u201cYou\u2019re flattered. Skip all that.\u201d He leaned forward seriously. \u201cWill you do it? Will your studies,\u201d he made a dismissive gesture westward, toward the University, \u201cpermit an absence of a season or so?\u201d\nI cleared my throat. \u201cI\u2019ve actually been considering taking my studies abroad for a time.\u201d\nThe count burst into a wide grin and thumped the arm of his chair. \u201cGood!\u201d he laughed. \u201cI thought I was going to have to pry you out of your precious University like a penny from a dead shim\u2019s fist! This is a wonderful opportunity, you realize. Once in a lifetime, really.\u201d He gave me a sly wink.", "\u201cBesides, a young man like yourself would be hard-pressed to find a better patron than a man who\u2019s richer than the king of Vint.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s some truth to that,\u201d I admitted aloud. Silently, I thought, Could I hope for better assistance in my search for the Amyr?\n\u201cThere\u2019s much truth to that,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cHow soon can you be ready to leave?\u201d\nI shrugged. \u201cTomorrow?\u201d\nThrepe raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou don\u2019t give much time for the dust to settle, do you?\u201d\n\u201cHe said he was in haste, and I\u2019d rather be early than late.\u201d\n\u201cTrue. True.\u201d He drew a silver gear-watch from his pocket, looked at it, then sighed as he clicked it closed. \u201cI\u2019ll have to miss some sleep tonight drafting a letter of introduction for you.\u201d\nI glanced at the window. \u201cIt\u2019s not even dark yet,\u201d I said. \u201cHow long do you expect it to take?\u201d\n\u201cHush,\u201d he said crossly. \u201cI write slowly, especially when I\u2019m sending a letter to someone as important as the Maer. Plus I have to describe you, no easy task by itself.\u201d\n\u201cLet me help you then,\u201d I said. \u201cNo sense losing sleep on my account.\u201d I smiled. \u201cBesides, if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m well-versed in it\u2019s my own good qualities.\u201d\nThe next day I made a round of hasty good-byes to everyone I knew at the University. I received heartfelt handshakes from Wilem and Simmon and a cheerful wave from Auri.\nKilvin grunted without looking up from his engraving and told me to write down any ideas I might have for the ever-burning lamp while I was away. Arwyl gave me a long, penetrating look through his spectacles and told me there would be a place for me in the Medica when I returned.\nElxa Dal was refreshing after the other masters\u2019 reserved responses. He laughed and admitted he was a little jealous of my freedom. He advised me to take full advantage of every reckless opportunity that presented itself. If a thousand miles wasn\u2019t enough to keep my escapades secret, he said, then nothing would.\n \nI had no luck finding Elodin, and settled for sliding a note under the door of his office. Though since he never seemed to use the place, it might be months before he found it.\nI bought a new travelsack and a few other things a sympathist should never be without: wax, string and wire, hook-needle and gut. My clothes were easy to pack, as I didn\u2019t own many.\nAs I loaded my pack, I slowly realized I couldn\u2019t take everything with me. This came as something of a shock. For so many years I\u2019d been able to carry everything I\u2019ve owned, usually with a hand to spare.\nBut since I\u2019d moved into this small garret room, I\u2019d begun gathering oddments and half-finished projects. I now had the luxury of two blankets. There were pages of notes, a circular piece of half-inscribed tin from the Fishery, a broken gear-clock I\u2019d taken to pieces to see if I could put it back together again.\nI finished loading my travelsack, then packed everything else into the trunk that sat at the foot of my bed. A few worn tools, a broken piece of slate I used for ciphering, a small wooden box with the handful of small treasures Auri had given me. . . .\nThen I went downstairs and asked Anker if he would mind stowing my possessions in the basement until I returned. He admitted a little guiltily that before I\u2019d started sleeping there, the tiny, slant-ceilinged room had been empty for years, and only used for storage. He was willing to leave it unrented if I promised to continue our current room-for-music arrangement after I returned. I gladly agreed, and swinging my lute case onto my shoulder I headed out the door.\nI wasn\u2019t entirely surprised to find Elodin on Stonebridge. Very little about the Master Namer surprised me these days. He sat on the waist-high stone lip of the bridge, swinging his bare feet over the hundred-foot drop to the river below.\n\u201cHello Kvothe,\u201d he said without turning his eyes from the churning water.\n\u201cHello Master Elodin,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to be leaving the University for a term or two.\u201d\n\u201cAre you really afraid?\u201d I noticed a whisper of amusement in his quiet,\n \nresonant voice.\nIt took me a moment to realize what he was referring to. \u201cIt\u2019s just a figure\nof speech.\u201d\n\u201cThe figures of our speaking are like pictures of names. Vague, weak\nnames, but names nonetheless. Be mindful of them.\u201d He looked up at me. \u201cSit with me for a moment.\u201d\nI started to excuse myself, then hesitated. He was my sponsor, after all. I set down my lute and travelsack on the flat stone of the bridge. A fond smile came over Elodin\u2019s boyish face and he slapped the stone parapet next to himself with the flat of his hand, offering me a seat.\nI looked over the edge with a hint of anxiety. \u201cI\u2019d rather not, Master Elodin.\u201d\nHe gave me a reproachful look. \u201cCaution suits an arcanist. Assurance suits a namer. Fear does not suit either. It does not suit you.\u201d He slapped the stone again, more firmly this time.\nI carefully climbed onto the parapet and swung my feet over the edge. The view was spectacular, exhilarating.\n\u201cCan you see the wind?\u201d\nI tried. For a moment it seemed as if... No. It was nothing. I shook my head.\nElodin shrugged nonchalantly, though I sensed a hint of disappointment. \u201cThis is a good place for a namer. Tell me why.\u201d\nI looked around. \u201cWide wind, strong water, old stone.\u201d\n\u201cGood answer.\u201d I heard genuine pleasure in his voice. \u201cBut there is another reason. Stone, water, and wind are other places too. What makes this different?\u201d\nI thought for a moment, looked around, shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cAnother good answer. Remember it.\u201d\nI waited for him to continue. When he didn\u2019t, I asked, \u201cWhat makes this a\ngood place?\u201d\nHe looked out over the water for a long time before he answered. \u201cIt is an\nedge,\u201d he said at last. \u201cIt is a high place with a chance of falling. Things are more easily seen from edges. Danger rouses the sleeping mind. It makes some things clear. Seeing things is a part of being a namer.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about falling?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cIf you fall, you fall,\u201d Elodin shrugged. \u201cSometimes falling teaches us things too. In dreams you often fall before you wake.\u201d", "We were both silent in our thoughts for a while. I closed my eyes and tried to listen for the name of the wind. I heard the water below, felt the stone of the bridge beneath my palms. Nothing.\n\u201cDo you know what they used to say when a student left the University for a term?\u201d Elodin asked.\nI shook my head.\n\u201cThey said he was chasing the wind,\u201d he chuckled.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard the expression.\u201d\n\u201cHave you? What did it seem to mean?\u201d\nI took a moment to choose my words. \u201cIt had a frivolous flavor. As if\nstudents were running around to no good purpose.\u201d\nElodin nodded. \u201cMost students leave for frivolous reasons, or to pursue\nfrivolous things.\u201d He leaned forward to look straight down at the river below. \u201cBut that was not always the meaning of it.\u201d\n\u201cNo?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d He sat back up again. \u201cLong ago, when all students aspired to be namers, things were different.\u201d He licked a finger and held it to the air. \u201cThe name most fledgling namers were encouraged to find was that of the wind. After they found that name, their sleeping minds were roused and finding other names was easier.\n\u201cBut some students had trouble finding the name of the wind. There were too few edges here, too little risk. So they would go off into the wild, uneducated lands. They would seek their fortunes, have adventures, hunt for secrets and treasure. . . .\u201d He looked at me. \u201cBut they were really looking for the name of the wind.\u201d\nOur conversation paused as someone came onto the bridge. It was a man with dark hair and a pinched face. He watched us from the corner of his eye without turning his head, and as he walked behind us I tried not to think how easy it would be for him to push me off the bridge.\nThen he was past us. Elodin gave a weary sigh and continued. \u201cThings have changed. There are even fewer edges now than there were before. The world is less wild. There are fewer magics, more secrets, and only a handful of people who know the name of the wind.\u201d\n\u201cYou know it, don\u2019t you?\u201d I asked.\nElodin nodded. \u201cIt changes from place to place, but I know how to listen for its changing shape.\u201d He laughed and clapped me on the shoulder. \u201cYou should go. Chase the wind. Do not be afraid of the occasional risk.\u201d He", "smiled. \u201cIn moderation.\u201d\nI swung my legs around, hopped off the thick wall, and resettled my lute\nand travelsack over my shoulder. But as I started toward Imre, Elodin\u2019s voice stopped me. \u201cKvothe.\u201d\nI turned and saw Elodin lean forward over the side of the bridge. He grinned like a schoolboy. \u201cSpit for luck.\u201d\nDevi opened the door for me and widened her eyes in shock. \u201cMy goodness,\u201d she said, pressing a piece of paper dramatically to her chest. I recognized it as one of the notes I left under her door. \u201cIt\u2019s my secret admirer.\u201d\n\u201cI was trying to pay off my loan,\u201d I said. \u201cI made four trips.\u201d\n\u201cThe walk is good for you,\u201d she said with a cheerful lack of sympathy as she motioned me inside, bolting the door behind me. The room smelled of. . .\nI sniffed. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d I asked.\nHer expression went rueful. \u201cIt was supposed to be pear.\u201d\nI lay down my lute case and travelsack and took a seat at her desk. Despite\nmy best intentions, my eyes were drawn to the charred black ring. Devi tossed her strawberry-blonde hair and met my eye. \u201cCare for a\nrematch?\u201d she asked, her mouth curving. \u201cI can still take you, gram or no gram. I can take you while I\u2019m dead asleep.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll admit to being curious,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I should tend to business instead.\u201d\n\u201cVery well,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you really going to pay me off entire? Have you finally found yourself a patron?\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cHowever, I have had a remarkable opportunity arise. The chance to get a fine patron indeed.\u201d I paused. \u201cIn Vintas.\u201d\nShe raised an eyebrow. \u201cThat\u2019s a long ways off,\u201d she said pointedly. \u201cI\u2019m glad you stopped to settle your debt before jaunting off to the other side of the world. Who knows when you\u2019ll be back.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d I said. \u201cHowever. I find myself in a bit of an odd place, financially speaking.\u201d\nDevi was already shaking her head before I finished speaking. \u201cAbsolutely not. You\u2019re already into me for nine talents. I am not loaning you more money the day you leave town.\u201d\n \nI held up my hands defensively. \u201cYou misunderstand,\u201d I said. I opened my purse and spilled talents and jots onto the table. Denna\u2019s ring tumbled out too, and I stopped it before it could roll off the edge of the table.\nI gestured to the pile of coins in front of me, slightly more than thirteen talents. \u201cThis is all the money I have in the world,\u201d I said. \u201cWith it, I need to get myself to Severen with fair speed. A thousand miles with some to spare. That means passage on at least one ship. Food. Lodging. Money for coaches or the use of a post note.\u201d\nAs I listed each of these things, I slid an appropriate amount of money from one side of the desk to the other. \u201cWhen I finally arrive in Severen, I will need to buy myself clothes that will allow me to move among the court without looking like the ragged musician I am.\u201d I slid more coins.\nI pointed at the few straggling coins remaining. \u201cThis does not leave me enough to settle my debt with you.\u201d\nDevi watched me over her steepled fingers. \u201cI see,\u201d she said seriously. \u201cWe must discover some alternate method for you to square your debt.\u201d\n\u201cMy thought is this,\u201d I said. \u201cI can leave you with collateral against my eventual return.\u201d\nHer eyes flickered down to the slender, dark shape of my lute case. \u201cNot my lute,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cI need that.\u201d\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou\u2019ve always said you have no collateral.\u201d \u201cI have a few things,\u201d I said, rummaging around in my travelsack and\nbrought up a book.\nDevi\u2019s eyes lit up. Then she read the spine. \u201cRhetoric and Logic?\u201d She\nmade a face.\n\u201cI feel the same way,\u201d I said. \u201cBut it\u2019s worth something. Especially to me.\nAlso . . .\u201d I reached into the pocket of my cloak and brought out my hand lamp. \u201cI have this. A sympathy lamp of my own design. It has a focused beam and a graded switch.\u201d\nDevi picked it up off the desk, nodding to herself. \u201cI remember this,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore, you said you couldn\u2019t give it up because of a promise you\u2019d made to Kilvin. Has that changed?\u201d\nI gave a bright smile that was two-thirds lie. \u201cThat promise is actually what makes that lamp the perfect piece of collateral,\u201d I said. \u201cIf you take this lamp to Kilvin, I have every confidence he will pay a lavish sum just to get it out of . . .\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cUnsavory hands.\u201d\nDevi flicked the switch idly with her thumb, spinning it from dim to bright", "and back again. \u201cAnd I imagine this would be a stipulation you require? That I return it to Kilvin?\u201d\n\u201cYou know me so well,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost embarrassing.\u201d\nDevi set the lamp back on the table next to my book and took a slow breath through her nose. \u201cA book that\u2019s only valuable to you,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd a lamp that\u2019s only valuable to Kilvin.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThis is not an appealing offer.\u201d\nI felt a pang as I reached to my shoulder and unclasped my talent pipes and slid them onto the table as well. \u201cThose are silver,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd hard to come by. They\u2019ll get you into the Eolian free, too.\u201d\n\u201cI know what they are.\u201d Devi picked them up and looked them over with a sharp eye. Then she pointed. \u201cYou had a ring.\u201d\nI froze. \u201cThat\u2019s not mine to give.\u201d\nDevi laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s in your pocket, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She snapped her fingers. \u201cCome now. Let me see it.\u201d\nI brought it out of my pocket, but I didn\u2019t hand it over. \u201cI went through a lot of trouble for this,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s the ring Ambrose took from a friend of mine. I\u2019m just waiting to return it to her.\u201d\nDevi sat silently, her hand outstretched. After a moment I put the ring onto her palm.\nShe held it close to the lamp and leaned forward, squinting one eye closed on her pixie face. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice stone,\u201d she said appreciatively.\n\u201cThe setting\u2019s new,\u201d I said miserably.\nDevi set the ring carefully on top of the book next to my pipes and hand lamp. \u201cHere is the deal,\u201d she said. \u201cI will keep these items as collateral against your current debt of nine talents. This will last for the space of one year.\u201d\n\u201cA year and a day,\u201d I said.\nA smile curved the corner of her mouth. \u201cHow storybook of you. Very well. This will postpone your repayment for a year and a day. If you have not repaid me by the end of that time, these items will be forfeit, and our debt will be cleared.\u201d Her smile went sharp. \u201cThough I may be persuaded to return them in exchange for certain information.\u201d\nI heard the belling tower in the distance and gave a deep sigh. I didn\u2019t have much time for bargaining, as I was already late for my meeting with Threpe. \u201cFine,\u201d I said, irritated. \u201cBut the ring will be kept somewhere safe. You can\u2019t wear it until I\u2019ve defaulted.\u201d", "Devi frowned. \u201cYou don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI am not movable on this point,\u201d I said seriously. \u201cIt belongs to a friend. It is precious to her. I would not have her see it on someone else\u2019s hand. Not after everything I did to get it back from Ambrose.\u201d\nDevi said nothing, her pixie face set in a grim expression. I put on my own grim expression and met her eye. I do a good grim expression when I need to.\nA long moment of silence stretched between us. \u201cFine!\u201d she said at last.\nWe shook hands. \u201cA year and a day,\u201d I said.", "CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE\nAll Wise Men Fear\nI STOPPED BY THE EOLIAN where Threpe was waiting for me, practically dancing with impatience. He had, he told me, found a boat heading downriver in less than an hour. What\u2019s more, he had already paid my way as far as Tarbean, where I should easily be able to find passage east.\nThe two of us hurried to the docks, arriving just as the ship was going through its final preparations. Threpe, red-faced and puffing from our brisk walk, hurried to give me a lifetime\u2019s worth of advice in the space of three minutes.\n\u201cThe Maer is old, old blood,\u201d he said. \u201cNot like most of the little nobility around these parts who can\u2019t tell you who their great-grandfathers are. So treat him with respect.\u201d\nI rolled my eyes. Why did everyone always expect me to behave so poorly?\n\u201cAnd remember,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look like you\u2019re chasing money, they\u2019ll see you as provincial. As soon as that happens no one will take you seriously. You\u2019re there to curry favor. That\u2019s the high-stakes game. Besides, fortune follows favor, as they say. If you get one, you\u2019ll have the other. It\u2019s like what Teccam wrote, \u2018The cost of a loaf is a simple thing, and so a loaf is often sought . . .\u2019 \u201d\n\u201c \u2018... but some things are past valuing: laughter, land, and love are never bought.\u2019\u201d I finished. It was actually a quote from Gregan the Lesser, but I didn\u2019t bother correcting him.\n\u201cHoy there!\u201d a tan, bearded man shouted to us from the deck of the ship. \u201cWe got one straggler we\u2019re waitin\u2019 on, and Captain\u2019s angry as an ugly whore. He swears he\u2019ll leave if he ain\u2019t here in two minutes. You\u2019d do well to be aboard by then.\u201d He wandered off without waiting for a reply.\n\u201cAddress him as your grace,\u201d Threpe continued as if we hadn\u2019t been interrupted. \u201cAnd remember: speak least if you would be most often heard. Oh!\u201d He drew a sealed letter from his breast pocket. \u201cHere\u2019s your letter of", "introduction. I may send another copy by post, just so he knows to expect you.\u201d\nI gave him a broad smile and gripped his arm. \u201cThank you, Denn,\u201d I said earnestly. \u201cFor everything. I appreciate all of this more than you know.\u201d\nThrepe waved the comment aside. \u201cI know you\u2019ll do splendidly. You\u2019re a clever boy. Mind that you find a good tailor when you get there. The fashions will be different. As they say: know a lady by her manner, a man by his cloth.\u201d\nI knelt and opened up my lute case. Moving the lute aside, I pressed the lid of the secret compartment and twisted it open. I slid Threpe\u2019s sealed letter inside, where it joined the hollow horn with Nina\u2019s drawing and a small sack of dried apple I had stowed there. There was nothing special about the dried apple, but in my opinion if you have a secret compartment in your lute case and don\u2019t use it to hide things, there is something terribly, terribly wrong with you.\nI snapped the clasps closed, refastening the lid, then stood and gathered up my belongings, ready to board the ship.\nThrepe gripped my shoulder suddenly. \u201cI almost forgot! Alveron mentioned in one of his letters that the young people in his court gamble. He thinks it\u2019s a deplorable habit, so stay clear of it. And remember, small thaws make great floods, so be twice wary of a slowly changing season.\u201d\nI saw someone running down the dock toward us. It was the pinch-faced man who had passed Elodin and me on Stonebridge earlier. He carried a cloth-wrapped package close under one arm.\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing that\u2019s their missing sailor,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cI\u2019d better get aboard.\u201d I gave Threpe a quick embrace and tried to get away before he could give me any more advice.\nBut he caught my sleeve as I turned. \u201cBe careful on your way there,\u201d he said, his expression anxious. \u201cRemember: There are three things all wise men fear: the sea in storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle man.\u201d\nThe sailor passed us and hit the gangplank running, unmindful of how the board jounced and clattered under his feet. I gave Threpe a reassuring smile and followed close on his heels. Two leathery men hauled up the plank, and I returned Threpe\u2019s final wave.\nOrders were shouted, men scrambled, and the ship began to move. I turned to face downriver, toward Tarbean, toward the sea.", "CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO\nA Brief Journey\nMY ROUTE WAS A simple one. I would head downriver to Tarbean, through the Refting Strait, down the coast toward Junpui, then up the Arrand River. It was more roundabout than going overland, but better in the long run. Even if I were to purchase a post letter and change horses at every opportunity, it would still take me almost three span to reach Severen overland. And most of that time would be in southern Atur and the Small Kingdoms. Only priests and fools expected the roads in that part of the world to be safe.\nThe water route added several hundred miles to the distance traveled, but ships at sea need not mind the twistings and turnings of a road. And while a good horse can set a better pace than a ship, you can\u2019t ride a horse day and night without stopping to rest. The water route would take about a dozen days, depending on the weather.\nMy curiosity was also glad to take the sea route. I had never been on any water larger than a river. My only real concern was that I might become bored with nothing but wind, waves, and sailors for company.\nSeveral unfortunate complications arose during the trip.\nIn brief, there was a storm, piracy, treachery, and shipwreck, although not\nin that order. It also goes without saying that I did a great many things, some heroic, some ill-advised, some clever and audacious.\nOver the course of my trip I was robbed, drowned, and left penniless on the streets of Junpui. In order to survive I begged for crusts, stole a man\u2019s shoes, and recited poetry. The last should demonstrate more than all the rest how truly desperate my situation became.\nHowever, as these events have little to do with the heart of the story, I must\n \npass them over in favor of more important things. Simply said, it took me sixteen days to reach Severen. A bit longer than I had planned, but at no point during my journey was I ever bored.", "CHAPTER FIFTY-THREE\nThe Sheer\nI LIMPED THROUGH THE GATES of Severen ragged, penniless, and hungry. I am no stranger to hunger. I know the countless hollow shapes it takes inside you. This particular hunger wasn\u2019t a terrible one. I\u2019d eaten two apples and some salt pork a day ago, so this hunger was merely painful. It wasn\u2019t the bad hunger that leaves you weak and trembling. I was safe from that for at least eight hours or so.\nOver the last two span everything I owned had been lost, destroyed, stolen, or abandoned. The only exception was my lute. Denna\u2019s marvelous case had paid for itself ten times during my trip. In addition to saving my life on one occasion, it had protected my lute, Threpe\u2019s letter of introduction, and Nina\u2019s invaluable drawing of the Chandrian.\nYou may notice I don\u2019t include any clothing on my list of possessions. There are two good reasons for this. The first is that you couldn\u2019t really call the grubby rags I wore clothing without stretching the truth to its breaking point. Secondly, I had stolen them, so it doesn\u2019t seem right to claim them as my own.\nThe most irritating was the loss of Fela\u2019s cloak. I\u2019d been forced to tear it up and use it for bandages in Junpui. Nearly as bad was the fact that my hard- won gram now lay somewhere deep below the cold, dark waters of the Centhe Sea.\nThe city of Severen was split into two unequal portions by a tall, white cliff. The majority of the living business of the city took place in the larger portion of the city at the foot of this cliff, aptly named the Sheer.\nAtop the Sheer was a much smaller piece of the city. It consisted mostly of estates and manor houses belonging to aristocracy and wealthy merchants.\n \nAlso present were the attendant number of tailors, liveries, theaters, and brothels necessary to provide for the needs of the upper class.\nThe stark cliff of white stone looked as if it had been thrust skyward to give the nobility a better view of the countryside. As it wandered off to the northeast and south, it lost height and stature, but where it bisected Severen, it was two hundred feet tall and steep as a garden wall.\nIn the center of the city, a wide peninsula of cliff jutted out from the Sheer. Perched on this outthrust piece of cliff was Maer Alveron\u2019s estate. Its pale stone walls were visible from anywhere in the city below. The effect was daunting, as if the Maer\u2019s ancestral home was peering down on you.\nSeeing it without a coin in my pocket or a decent set of clothes on my back was rather intimidating. I\u2019d planned to take Threpe\u2019s letter straight to the Maer despite my disheveled state, but looking up at the tall stone walls, I realized I probably wouldn\u2019t be let through the front door. I looked like a filthy beggar.\nI had few resources and even fewer options to choose from. With the exception of Ambrose some miles to the south in his father\u2019s barony, I didn\u2019t know a single soul in all of Vintas.\nI\u2019ve begged before, and I\u2019ve stolen. But only when I\u2019ve had no other options available to me. They are dangerous occupations and only a complete fool attempts them in an unfamiliar city, let alone an entirely new country. Here in Vintas, I didn\u2019t even know what laws I might be breaking.\nSo I gritted my teeth and took the only option available to me. I wandered barefoot through the cobblestone streets of Severen-Low until I found a pawn shop in one of the better parts of the city.\nI stood across the street for the better part of an hour, watching the people come and go, trying to think of some better option. But I simply didn\u2019t have one. So I removed Threpe\u2019s letter and Nina\u2019s painting from the secret compartment in my lute case, crossed the street, and pawned my lute and case for eight silver nobles and a span note.\nIf you\u2019ve led the sort of easy life that\u2019s never taken you to the pawners, let me explain. The note was a receipt of sorts, and with it, I could buy my lute back for the same amount of money, so long as I did it within eleven days. On the twelfth day it became the property of the pawnbroker who would undoubtedly turn around and sell it for ten times that amount.\nBack on the street, I hefted the coins. They seemed thin and insubstantial compared to Cealdish currency or the heavy Commonwealth pennies I was", "familiar with. Still, money spends the same the world round, and seven nobles bought me a fine suit of clothes of the sort a gentleman might wear, along with a pair of soft leather boots. What remained bought a haircut, shave, bath, and my first solid meal in three days. After that I was coin-poor again, but feeling much more sure of myself.\nStill, I knew it would be difficult to make my way to the Maer. Men with his degree of power live within layers of protection. There are customary, graceful ways to navigate these layers: introductions and audiences, messages and rings, calling cards and ass-kissing.\nBut with only eleven days to get my lute out of pawn, my time was too precious for that. I needed to make contact with Alveron quickly.\nSo I made my way to the foot of the Sheer and found a small caf\u00e9 that catered to a genteel clientele. I used one of my precious few remaining coins to buy a mug of chocolate and a seat with a view of the haberdasher\u2019s across the street.\nOver the next several hours I listened to the gossip that flows through such places. Even better, I won the trust of the clever young boy who worked at the caf\u00e9, waiting to refill my mug if I so desired. With his help and some casual eavesdropping, I learned a great deal about the Maer\u2019s court in a short amount of time.\nEventually the shadows grew longer, and I decided it was time to move. I called the boy over and pointed across the street. \u201cDo you see that gentleman? The one in the red vest?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know who it is?\u201d\n\u201cThe Esquire Bergon, if \u2019n it please you.\u201d\nI needed someone more important than that. \u201cHow about the cross-looking\nfellow in the awful yellow hat?\u201d\nThe boy hid a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s Baronet Pettur.\u201d\nPerfect. I stood and clapped Jim on the back. \u201cYou\u2019ll do well for yourself\nwith a memory like that. Keep well.\u201d I gave him ha\u2019penny and strolled to where the baronet stood, fingering a bolt of deep green velvet.\nIt goes without saying that in terms of social rank, there are none lower than the Edema Ruh. Even leaving aside my heritage, I was a landless commoner. This meant in terms of social standing the baronet was so high above me that if he were a star, I would not be able to see him with the naked eye. A person of my position should address him as \u201cmy lord,\u201d avoid eye", "contact, and bow deeply and humbly.\nTruth be told, a person of my social standing shouldn\u2019t speak to him at all. Things were different in the Commonwealth, of course. And the University\nitself was particularly egalitarian. But even there, nobility were still rich and powerful and well-connected. People like Ambrose would always run roughshod over folk like myself. And if things got difficult, he could always hush things up or bribe a judge to get himself out of trouble.\nBut I was in Vintas now. Here Ambrose wouldn\u2019t need to bribe the judge. If I\u2019d accidentally jostled the Baronet Pettur in the street while I was still barefoot and muddy, he could have horsewhipped me bloody, then called the constable to arrest me for being a public nuisance. The constable would have done it too, with a smile and a nod.\nLet me try to say this more succinctly. In the Commonwealth, the gentry are people with power and money. In Vintas, the gentry have power and money and privilege. Many rules simply do not apply to them.\nThat meant in Vintas, social rank was of utmost importance.\nThat meant if the baronet knew I was below him, he would lord it over me, quite literally.\nOn the other hand . . .\nAs I walked across the street toward the baronet, I straightened my shoulders and raised my chin a bit. I stiffened my neck and narrowed my eyes slightly. I looked around as if I owned the entire street, and it was currently something of a disappointment.\n\u201cBaronet Pettur?\u201d I said briskly.\nThe man looked up, smiling vaguely, as if he couldn\u2019t decide if he recognized me or not. \u201cYes?\u201d\nI made a curt gesture toward the Sheer. \u201cYou would be doing the Maer a great service if you would escort me to his estate as quickly as possible.\u201d I kept my expression stern, almost angry.\n\u201cWell, certainly.\u201d He sounded anything but certain. I could sense the questions, the excuses beginning to bubble up in him. \u201cW\u2014\u201d\nI fixed the baronet with my haughtiest stare. The Edema might be on the lowest rung of the social ladder, but there are no finer actors breathing. I had been raised on the stage, and my father could play a king so regal I\u2019d seen audiences doff their hats when he made his entrance.\nI made my eyes as hard as agates and looked the florid man up and down as if he were a horse I wasn\u2019t sure I cared to bet on. \u201cIf the matter were not", "urgent, I would never impose on you this way.\u201d I hesitated, then added a stiff, reluctant, \u201cSir.\u201d\nBaronet Pettur looked me in the eye. He was slightly off balance, but not nearly as much as I\u2019d hoped. Like most nobility, he was self-centered as a gyroscope, and the only thing keeping him from sniffing and looking down his nose at me was his uncertainty. He eyed me, trying to decide if he could risk offending me by asking my name and how we were acquainted.\nBut I still had a final trick to play. I brought out the thin, sharp smile the porter at the Grey Man had used when I had come calling on Denna all those months ago. As I\u2019d said, it was a good smile: gracious, polite, and more patronizing than if I\u2019d reached out and patted the man on the head like a dog.\nThe Baronet Pettur bore up under the weight of the smile for almost a full second. Then he cracked like an egg, his shoulders rounding a bit, and his manner becoming ever so slightly obsequious. \u201cAny service I can lend the Maer is a service I am glad to render,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease, allow me.\u201d He took the lead, heading toward the foot of the cliff.\nFollowing behind, I smiled.", "CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR\nThe Messenger\nI MANAGED TO BLUFF AND fast-talk my way through the majority of the Maer\u2019s defenses. The Baronet Pettur helped me simply by his presence. Being escorted by a recognizable member of the nobility was enough to get me deep inside Alveron\u2019s estate. After that, he soon outlived his usefulness and I left him behind.\nOnce he was out of sight I put on my most impatient face, asked a busy servant for directions, and made it all the way to the outer doors of the Maer\u2019s audience chamber before I was stopped by an unassuming man in his middle years. He was portly, with a round face, and despite his fine clothes he looked like a grocer to me.\nIf not for the several hours I\u2019d spent gathering information in Severen-Low I might have made a terrible mistake and tried to bluff my way past this man, thinking him nothing more than a well-dressed servant.\nBut this was actually the person I was looking for: the Maer\u2019s manservant, Stapes. Though he looked like a grocer, he had the aura of true authority about him. His manner was quiet and certain, unlike the overbearing, brash one I had used to bully the baronet.\n\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d Stapes asked. His tone was perfectly polite, but there were other questions lurking beneath the surface of his words. Who are you? What are you doing here?\nI brought out Count Threpe\u2019s letter and handed it over with a slight bow. \u201cYou would be doing me a great service if you would convey this to the Maer,\u201d I said. \u201cHe is expecting me.\u201d\nStapes gave me a cool look, making it perfectly clear that if the Maer had been expecting me, he would have known about it ten days ago. He rubbed his chin as he looked me over, and I saw he wore a dull iron ring with gold letters scrolling across the surface.\nDespite his obvious misgivings, Stapes took the letter and disappeared through a set of double doors. I stood in the hallway for a nervous minute", "before he returned and ushered me inside, his manner still vaguely disapproving.\nWe moved through a short hallway, then came to a second set of doors flanked by armored guards. These weren\u2019t ceremonial guards of the sort you sometimes see in public, standing stiffly at attention, holding halberds. They wore the Maer\u2019s colors but beneath their sapphire and ivory were functional breastplates with steel rings and leather. Each man wore a long sword and a long knife. They eyed me seriously as I approached.\nThe Maer\u2019s manservant nodded to me, and one of the guards manhandled me in a quick, competent way, sliding his hands along my arms and legs and around my chest, searching for hidden weapons. I was suddenly very glad for some of the misfortunes on my trip, specifically the ones that had ended with me losing the pair of slender knives I\u2019d grown accustomed to wearing underneath my clothes.\nThe guard stepped back and nodded. Then Stapes gave me another irritated look and opened the inner door.\nInside, two men sat at a map-strewn table. One was tall and bald with the hard, weathered look of a veteran soldier. Next to him sat the Maer.\nAlveron was older than I had expected. He had a serious face, proud around the mouth and eyes. His well-trimmed salt-and-pepper beard had very little black left to it, but his hair was still full and thick. His eyes too, seemed to belie his age. They were clear grey, clever and piercing. They were not the eyes of an old man.\nThe Maer turned those eyes on me as I entered the room. He held Threpe\u2019s letter in one hand.\nI made a standard number three bow. \u201cThe Messenger\u201d as my father called it. Low and formal, as fitting the Maer\u2019s high station. Deferential, but not obsequious. Just because I tread heavily on propriety\u2019s toes doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t play the game when it\u2019s of use to me.\nThe Maer\u2019s eyes flickered down to the letter, then back up. \u201cKvothe, is it? You travel swiftly to arrive in such good time. I\u2019d not expected even a reply from the count so soon.\u201d\n\u201cI made all possible speed to put myself at your disposal, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d He looked me over carefully. \u201cAnd you seem to vindicate the count\u2019s opinion of your wit by making it all the way to my door with nothing but a sealed letter in your hand.\u201d\n\u201cI thought it best to present myself as soon as possible, your grace,\u201d I said", "neutrally. \u201cYour letter implied you were in some haste.\u201d\n\u201cAnd an impressive job you did of it too,\u201d Alveron said, glancing at the tall\nman sitting at the table next to him. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you say, Dagon?\u201d\n\u201cYes, your grace.\u201d Dagon looked at me with dark, dispassionate eyes. His\nface was hard and sharp and emotionless. I suppressed a shiver. Alveron glanced down at the letter again. \u201cThrepe certainly has some\nflattering things to say about you here,\u201d he said. \u201cWell-spoken. Charming. Most talented musician he\u2019s met in ten years. . . .\u201d\nThe Maer continued reading, then looked back up, his eyes shrewd. \u201cYou seem a bit young,\u201d he said hesitantly. \u201cYou\u2019re barely past twenty, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nI was a month past my sixteenth birthday. A fact I\u2019d pointedly omitted from the letter. \u201cI am young, your grace,\u201d I admitted, sidestepping the actual lie. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been making music since I was four.\u201d I spoke with quiet confidence, doubly glad of my new clothes. In my rags, I couldn\u2019t have helped but look like a starving urchin. As it was, I was well-dressed and tanned from my days at sea, and the lean lines of my face added years to my appearance.\nAlveron eyed me for a long, speculative moment, then nodded, apparently satisfied. \u201cVery well,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, I am rather busy at present. Would tomorrow be convenient for you?\u201d It wasn\u2019t really a question. \u201cHave you found lodgings in the city?\u201d\n\u201cI have not made any arrangements as of yet, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cYou will stay here,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cStapes?\u201d He called in a voice hardly louder than his normal speaking tone, and the portly, grocer-looking fellow appeared almost instantly. \u201cSet our new guest somewhere in the south wing, near the gardens.\u201d He turned back to me. \u201cWill your luggage be following?\u201d\n\u201cI fear all my luggage was lost on the way, your grace. Shipwreck.\u201d\nAlveron raised an eyebrow briefly. \u201cStapes will see you are properly outfitted.\u201d He folded Threpe\u2019s letter and made a gesture of dismissal. \u201cGood evening.\u201d\nI made a quick bow and followed Stapes from the room.\nThe rooms were the most opulent I\u2019d ever seen, let alone lived in, full of old\n \nwood and polished stone. The bed had a feather mattress a foot thick, and when I drew its curtains and lay inside, it seemed as big as my entire room back at Anker\u2019s.\nMy rooms were so pleasant it took me almost a full day to realize how much I hated them.\nAgain you have to think in terms of shoes. You don\u2019t want the biggest pair. You want a pair that fits. If your shoes are too big, your feet chafe and blister.\nIn a similar way, my rooms chafed at me. There was an immense empty wardrobe, empty chests of drawers, and bare bookshelves. My room in Anker\u2019s had been tiny, but here I felt like a dried pea rattling around inside an empty jewelry box.\nBut while the rooms were too large for my nonexistent possessions, they were too small for me. I was obliged to remain there, waiting for the Maer to summon me. Since I had no idea when this might happen, I was effectively trapped.\nIn defense of the Maer\u2019s hospitality, I should mention a few positive things. The food was excellent, if somewhat cold by the time it made its way from the kitchens. There was also a wonderful copper bathing basin. Servants brought the hot water, but it drained away through a series of pipes. I had not expected to find such conveniences so far from the civilizing influence of the University.\nI was visited by one of the Maer\u2019s tailors, an excitable little man who measured me six dozen different ways while chattering about the court gossip. The next day, a runner boy delivered two elaborate suits of clothing in colors that flattered me.\nIn a way, I was fortunate I\u2019d met with trouble at sea. The clothing Alveron\u2019s tailors supplied was much better than anything I could have afforded, even with Threpe\u2019s help. As a result, I cut quite a striking figure during my stay in Severen.\nBest of all, while checking the fit of my clothes the chatty tailor mentioned cloaks were in fashion. I took the opportunity to exaggerate somewhat about the cloak Fela had given me, bemoaning the loss of it.\nThe result was a richly colored burgundy cloak. It wouldn\u2019t keep the rain off worth a damn, but I was quite fond of it. Not only did it make me look rather dashing, but it was full of clever little pockets, of course.\nSo I was dressed, fed, and boarded in luxury. But despite this largess, by noon of the next day I was prowling my rooms like a cat in a crate. I itched to", "be outside, to have my lute out of pawn, to discover why the Maer needed the service of someone clever, well-spoken, and above all, discreet.", "CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE\nGrace\nI PEERED AT THE MAER through a gap in the hedge. He was sitting on a stone bench under a shade tree in his gardens, looking every bit the gentleman in his loose sleeves and waistcoat. He wore the house colors of Alveron: sapphire and ivory. But while his clothes were fine, they weren\u2019t ostentatious. He wore a gold signet ring, but no other jewelry. Compared to many others in his court, the Maer was almost plainly dressed.\nAt first this seemed to imply that Alveron disdained the fashions of the court. But after a moment, I saw the truth of it. The ivory of his shirt was creamy and flawless, the sapphire of his waistcoat vibrant. I would have bet my thumbs they hadn\u2019t been worn more than a half-dozen times.\nAs a display of wealth, it was subtle and staggering. It was one thing to be able to afford fine clothes, but how much would it cost to maintain a wardrobe that never showed the slightest hint of wear? I thought of what Count Threpe had said about Alveron: Rich as the King of Vint.\nThe Maer himself looked much the same as before. Tall and thin. Greying and immaculately groomed. I took in the tired lines of his face, the slight tremble of his hands, his posture. He looks old, I thought to myself, but he\u2019s not.\nThe belling tower began to strike the hour. I stepped back from the hedge and strolled around the corner to meet the Maer.\nAlveron nodded, his cool eyes looking me over carefully. \u201cKvothe, I was rather hoping you would come.\u201d\nI gave a semi-formal bow. \u201cI was pleased to receive your invitation, your grace.\u201d\nAlveron made no gesture for me to seat myself, so I remained standing. I guessed he was testing my manners. \u201cI hope you do not mind our meeting outside. Have you seen the gardens yet?\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had the opportunity, your grace.\u201d I\u2019d been trapped in my damned rooms until he had sent for me.", "\u201cYou must allow me to show you around.\u201d He took hold of a polished walking stick that rested against the shade tree. \u201cI\u2019ve always found that taking some air is good for whatever troubles a body, though others disagree.\u201d He leaned forward as if he would stand, but a shadow of pain crossed his face and he drew a shallow, painful breath between his teeth. Sick. I realized. Not old, sick.\nI was at his side in a twinkling and offered him my arm. \u201cAllow me, your grace.\u201d\nThe Maer gave a stiff smile. \u201cIf I were younger, I\u2019d make light of your offer,\u201d he sighed. \u201cBut pride is the luxury of the strong.\u201d He laid a thin hand on my arm and used my support to gain his feet. \u201cI must settle for being gracious instead.\u201d\n\u201cGraciousness is the luxury of the wise,\u201d I said easily. \u201cSo it can be noted that your wisdom lends you grace.\u201d\nAlveron gave a wry chuckle and patted my arm. \u201cThat makes it a bit easier to bear, I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cWould you like your stick, your grace?\u201d I asked. \u201cOr shall we walk together?\u201d\nHe made the same dry chuckle. \u201c \u2018Walk together.\u2019 That\u2019s delicately put.\u201d He took the stick in his right hand while his left held my arm in a surprisingly strong grip.\n\u201cLord and lady,\u201d he swore under his breath. \u201cI hate to be seen doddering about. But it\u2019s less galling to lean on a young man\u2019s arm than hobble around on my own. It\u2019s a horrible thing to have your body fail you. You never think about it when you\u2019re young.\u201d\nWe began to walk, and our conversation lulled as we listened to the sound of water splashing in the fountains and birds singing in the hedges. Occasionally the Maer would point out a particular piece of statuary and tell which of his ancestors had commissioned it, made it, or (he spoke of these in a quieter, apologetic tone) plundered it from foreign lands in times of war.\nWe walked about the gardens for the better part of an hour. Alveron\u2019s weight on my arm gradually lessened and soon he was using me more for balance than support. We passed several gentlefolk who bowed or nodded to the Maer. After they were out of earshot he would mention who they were, how they ranked in court, and a snippet or two of amusing gossip.\n\u201cThey\u2019re wondering who you are,\u201d he said after one such couple had passed behind a hedge. \u201cBy tonight it will be all the talk. Are you an", "ambassador from Renere? A young noble looking for a rich fief and a wife to go along? Perhaps you are my long-lost son, a remnant from my wilder youth.\u201d He chuckled to himself and patted my arm. He might have continued, but he stumbled on a protruding flagstone and almost fell. I steadied him quickly, and eased him onto a stone bench beside the path.\n\u201cDamn and bother,\u201d he cursed, obviously embarrassed. \u201cHow would that have looked, the Maer scrabbling about like a beetle on its back?\u201d He looked around crossly, but we seemed to be alone. \u201cWould you do an old man a favor?\u201d\n\u201cI am at your disposal, your grace.\u201d\nAlveron gave me a shrewd look. \u201cAre you indeed? Well, it\u2019s a little thing. Keep secretive about who you are and what your business is. It\u2019ll do wonders for your reputation. The less you tell them, the more everyone will be wanting to get from you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep close about myself, your grace. But I would have better luck avoiding the subject of why I\u2019m here if I knew what it was. . . .\u201d\nAlveron\u2019s expression went sly. \u201cTrue. But this is too public a place. You\u2019ve shown good patience so far. Exercise it a while longer.\u201d He looked up at me. \u201cWould you be so kind as to walk me to my rooms?\u201d\nI held out my arm. \u201cCertainly, your grace.\u201d\nAfter returning to my rooms, I removed my embroidered jacket and hung it in the carved rosewood wardrobe. The huge piece of furniture was lined with cedar and sandalwood, scenting the air. Large, flawless mirrors hung on the insides of the doors.\nI walked across the polished marble floor and sat on a red velvet lounging couch. I idly wondered how exactly one was supposed to lounge. I couldn\u2019t remember ever doing it myself. After a moment\u2019s consideration, I decided lounging was probably similar to relaxing, but with more money in your pocket.\nRestless, I got to my feet and moved around the room. There were paintings on the walls, portraits and pastoral scenes done skillfully in oil. One wall held a huge tapestry that showed a vast naval battle in intricate detail. That occupied my attention for almost half an hour.\n \nI missed my lute.\nIt had been terribly hard to pawn it, like cutting off my hand. I\u2019d fully expected to spend the next ten days sick with worry, anxious that I wouldn\u2019t be able to buy it back.\nBut without meaning to, the Maer himself had set my mind at ease. In my wardrobe hung six suits of clothing, fine enough for any lord. When they had been delivered to my room, I\u2019d felt myself relax. My first thought on seeing them wasn\u2019t that I could now mingle comfortably with court society. I thought that if worse came to worst, I could steal them, sell them to a fripperer, and easily have enough money to reclaim my lute.\nOf course if I did such a thing, I would burn all my bridges with the Maer. It would render my entire trip to Severen pointless, and would embarrass Threpe so profoundly that he might never speak to me again. Nevertheless, knowing I had that option gave me a thin thread of control over the situation. It was enough so I could keep from going absolutely mad with worry.\nI missed my lute, but if I could gain the Maer\u2019s patronage, my life\u2019s road would grow suddenly smooth and straight. The Maer had money enough for me to continue my education at the University. His connections could help me continue my research into the Amyr.\nPerhaps most important was the power of his name. If the Maer were my patron, I would be under his protection. Ambrose\u2019s father might be the most powerful baron in all of Vintas, a dozen steps from royalty. But Alveron was practically a king in his own right. How much simpler would my life become without Ambrose endlessly spiking my wheel? It was a giddy thought.\nI missed my lute, but all things have their price. For a chance of having the Maer as a patron, I was willing to grit my teeth and spend a span bored and anxious, without music.\nAlveron turned out to be right about the curious nature of his attendant court. After he called me to his study that evening, rumor exploded like a brushfire around me. I could understand why the Maer enjoyed this sort of thing. It was like watching stories being born.", "CHAPTER FIFTY-SIX\nPower\nALVERON SENT FOR ME again the next day, and soon the two of us were strolling along the garden paths again, his hand resting lightly on my arm. \u201cLet\u2019s head toward the south side.\u201d The Maer pointed with his walking stick. \u201cI hear the selas will reach full bloom soon.\u201d\nWe took the left turning of the path and he drew a breath. \u201cThere are two types of power: inherent and granted,\u201d Alveron said, letting me know the topic of today\u2019s conversation. \u201cInherent power you possess as a part of yourself. Granted power is lent or given by other people.\u201d He looked sideways at me. I nodded.\nSeeing my agreement, the Maer continued. \u201cInherent power is an obvious thing. Strength of body.\u201d He patted my supporting arm. \u201cStrength of mind. Strength of personality. All these things lie within a person. They define us. They determine our limits.\u201d\n\u201cNot entirely, your grace,\u201d I protested gently. \u201cA man can always improve himself.\u201d\n\u201cThey limit us,\u201d the Maer said firmly. \u201cA man with one hand will never wrestle in the roundings. A man with one leg will never run as quickly as a man with two.\u201d\n\u201cAn Adem warrior with only one hand might be more deadly than a common warrior with two, your grace.\u201d I pointed out. \u201cDespite his deficiency.\u201d\n\u201cTrue, true,\u201d the Maer said crossly. \u201cWe can improve ourselves, exercise our bodies, educate our minds, groom ourselves carefully.\u201d He ran a hand down his immaculate salt-and-pepper beard. \u201cFor even appearance is a type of power. But there are always limits. While a one-handed man might become a passable warrior, he could not play a lute.\u201d\nI nodded slowly. \u201cYou make a good point, your grace. Our power has limits we can extend, but not indefinitely.\u201d\nAlveron held up a finger. \u201cBut that is only the first type of power. We are", "only limited if we rely upon the power we ourselves possess. There is still the type of power that is given. Do you understand what I mean by granted power?\u201d\nI thought a moment. \u201cTaxes?\u201d\n\u201cHmm,\u201d the Maer said, surprised. \u201cThat\u2019s a rather good example, actually. Have you put much thought into this sort of thing before?\u201d\n\u201cA bit,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut never in these terms.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a difficult thing,\u201d he said, sounding pleased by my response. \u201cWhich do you think is the greater type of power?\u201d\nI only had to think for a second. \u201cThe inherent, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cInteresting. Why do you say that?\u201d\n\u201cBecause a power you possess yourself cannot be taken away, your grace.\u201d \u201cAh.\u201d He raised a long finger as if to caution me. \u201cBut we\u2019ve already\nagreed that type of power is severely limited. Granted power has no limits.\u201d \u201cNo limits, your grace?\u201d\nAlveron nodded his head in concession. \u201cVery few limits, then.\u201d\nI still didn\u2019t agree. The Maer must have seen it on my face because he\nleaned toward me to explain. \u201cLet\u2019s say I have an enemy, young and strong. Let\u2019s say he has stolen something of mine, some money. Are you with me?\u201d\nI nodded.\n\u201cNo manner of training will make me the match of a quarrelsome twenty- year-old. So what do I do? I get one of my young, strong friends to go and box his ears. With that strength I can accomplish a feat which would be otherwise impossible.\u201d\n\u201cYour enemy could box your friend\u2019s ears instead,\u201d I pointed out as we rounded a corner. An arching trellis turned the path ahead of us into a shaded tunnel, thick with deep green leaves.\n\u201cLet\u2019s say I got three friends together,\u201d the Maer amended. \u201cSuddenly I\u2019ve been granted the strength of three men! My enemy, even if he were very strong, could never be as strong as that. Look to the selas. Terribly difficult to cultivate, they tell me.\u201d\nWe entered the shadow of the trellis tunnel where hundreds of deep red petals blossomed in the shade of leaf and arch. The smell was sweet and tremulous. I brushed a hand across one of the deep red blooms. It was unspeakably soft. I thought of Denna.\nThe Maer returned to our discussion. \u201cYou\u2019re missing the point, anyway. The lending of strength is just a small example. Some types of power can", "only be given.\u201d\nHe made a subtle gesture to a corner of the garden. \u201cDo you see Compte\nFarlend over there? If you asked him about his title, he would say he possesses it. He would claim it is a part of him as much as his own blood. A part of his blood, in fact. Almost any noble would say the same thing. They would argue their lineage imbued them with the right to rule.\u201d\nThe Maer looked up at me, his eyes glittering in amusement. \u201cBut they\u2019re wrong. It is not inherent power. It is granted. I could take away his lands and leave him a pauper on the street.\u201d\nAlveron motioned me closer, and I leaned a bit. \u201cHere is a great secret. Even my title, my riches, my control over people and the land. It is only granted power. It belongs to me no more than does the strength of your arm.\u201d He patted my hand and smiled at me. \u201cBut I know the difference, and that is why I am always in control.\u201d\nHe straightened and spoke in normal tones. \u201cGood afternoon, Compte. Lovely day to be out in the sun, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d\n\u201cIndeed, your grace. The selas are quite breathtaking.\u201d The Compte was a heavy man with jowls and a thick mustache. \u201cMy compliments.\u201d\nAfter the compte had passed us by, Alveron continued. \u201cYou notice he complimented me on the selas? I have never touched a trowel in my life.\u201d He looked sideways at me, his expression slightly smug. \u201cDo you still think inherent power is the better of the two?\u201d\n\u201cYou make a compelling point, your grace,\u201d I said. \u201cHowever\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a hard one to convince. One last example, then. Can we agree that I will never be able to give birth to a child?\u201d\n\u201cI think that is safe to say, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cYet if a woman grants me the right to wed her, I can give birth to a son. Through granted power, a man can make himself as fast as a horse, as strong as an ox. Can inherent power do this for you?\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t argue that. \u201cI bow to your argument, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cI bow to your wisdom in accepting it.\u201d He chuckled, and at the same time the faint ringing of the hour moved through the garden. \u201cOh bother,\u201d the Maer said, his expression souring. \u201cI must go take that dreadful nostrum of mine or Caudicus will be completely unmanageable for a span of days.\u201d I gave him a quizzical look and he explained. \u201cHe somehow discovered that I poured yesterday\u2019s dose in the chamber pot.\u201d\n\u201cYour grace should be mindful of your health.\u201d", "Alveron scowled. \u201cYou overstep yourself,\u201d he snapped.\nI flushed in embarrassment, but before I could apologize he waved me into silence. \u201cYou\u2019re right, of course. I know my duty. But you sound just like him. One Caudicus is enough for me.\u201d\nHe paused to nod toward an approaching couple. The man was tall and handsome, a few years older than myself. The woman was perhaps thirty, with dark eyes and an elegant, wicked mouth. \u201cGood evening, Lady Hesua. I trust your father is continuing to improve?\u201d\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d she said. \u201cThe surgeon says he should be up before the span is through.\u201d She caught my eye and held it briefly, her red mouth curving into a knowing smile.\nThen she was past us. I found myself sweating a bit.\nIf the Maer noticed, he ignored it. \u201cTerrible woman. New man every span of days. Her father was wounded in a duel with Esquire Higton over an \u2018inappropriate\u2019 remark. A true remark, but that doesn\u2019t count for much once the swords are out.\u201d\n\u201cWhat of the squire?\u201d\n\u201cDied the day after. Pity too. He was a good man, just didn\u2019t know enough to mind his tongue.\u201d He sighed and looked up at the belling tower. \u201cAs I was saying. One physician is quite enough for me. Caudicus clucks over me like a mother hen. I hate taking medicine when I am already on the mend.\u201d\nThe Maer did seem better today. He hadn\u2019t really needed the support of my arm during our walk. I sensed he only leaned on me to give us an excuse to be talking so close together. \u201cYour improving health seems proof enough that his ministrations work to heal you,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYes, yes. His potives drive away my illness for a span of days. Sometimes for months.\u201d He sighed bitterly. \u201cBut they always come back. Shall I be drinking potions the rest of my life?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps the need for them will pass, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cI had hoped the same thing myself. In his recent travels Caudicus gathered some herbs that worked wondrous well. His last treatment left me hale for nearly a year. I thought I was finally free of it.\u201d The Maer scowled down at his walking stick. \u201cYet here I am.\u201d\n\u201cIf I could aid you in any way, your grace, I would.\u201d\nAlveron turned his head to look me in the eye. After a moment he nodded to himself. \u201cI do believe you would,\u201d he said. \u201cHow extraordinary.\u201d", " Several conversations of a similar sort followed. I could tell the Maer was trying to get a feel for me. With all the skill learned in forty years of courtly intrigue, he steered the conversation in subtle ways, learning my opinions, determining whether or not I was worthy of his trust.\nWhile I didn\u2019t have the Maer\u2019s experience, I was a fair conversationalist myself. I was always careful with my answers, always courteous. After a few days, a mutual respect began to grow between us. Not a friendship such as I had with Count Threpe. The Maer never encouraged me to disregard his title or sit in his presence, but we were growing closer. While Threpe was a friend, the Maer was like a distant grandfather: kind but older, serious, and reserved.\nI got the impression the Maer was a lonely man, forced to remain aloof from his subjects and the members of his court. I almost suspected he might have sent to Threpe for a companion. Someone clever but removed from the politics of court so he could have an honest conversation once in a while.\nAt first I dismissed such an idea as unlikely, but the days continued to pass and still the Maer avoided any mention of what use he planned to put me to.\nIf I\u2019d had my lute I could have passed the time pleasantly, but it still lay in Severen-Low, seven days away from belonging to the pawnshop. So there was no music, just my echoing rooms and my damnable useless idleness.\nAs rumors about me spread, various members of the court came to visit. Some made a pretense of welcoming me. Others made a show of wanting to gossip. I even suspected there were a few attempts at seduction, but at that point in my life I knew so little of women that I was immune to those games. One gentleman even tried to borrow money from me, and I was hard pressed not to laugh in his face.\nThey told different stories and used different degrees of subtlety, but they were all there for the same reason: to glean information from me. However, since I was under the Maer\u2019s instructions to be tight-lipped about myself, all the conversations were brief and unsatisfying.\nAll but one, I should say. The exception proves the rule.", "CHAPTER FIFTY-SEVEN\nA Handful of Iron\nI MET BREDON ON MY fourth day in Severen. It was early, but I was already pacing my rooms, nearly insane with boredom. I\u2019d had my breakfast, and it was hours before lunch.\nSo far today I\u2019d dealt with three courtiers come to pry at me. I dealt with them deftly, running our conversations aground at every opportunity. So where are you from, my boy? Oh, you know how it is. One travels so. And your parents? Yes actually. I had them. Two in fact. What brings you to Severen? A coach and four, for the most part. Though I walked a bit as well. Good for the lungs, you know. And what are you doing here? Enjoying good conversation, of course. Meeting interesting people. Really? Who? Why all sorts. Including you, Lord Praevek. You are quite the fascinating fellow . . . .\nAnd so on. It wasn\u2019t long before even the most tenacious rumormonger grew weary and left.\nWorst of all, these brief exchanges would be the most interesting part of my day if the Maer didn\u2019t call for me. So far we\u2019d conversed over a light lunch, three times during brief walks in the garden, and once late at night when most sensible people would be abed. Twice Alveron\u2019s runner woke me from a sound sleep before the sky began to color with the blue beginning of dawn\u2019s light.\nI know when I am being tested. Alveron wanted to see if I was truly willing to make myself available to him at any unreasonable hour of the day or night. He was watching to see if I would become impatient or irritated by his casual use of me.\nSo I played the game. I was charming and unfailingly polite. I came when he called and left as soon as he was through with me. I asked no impertinent questions, made no demands on him, and spent the remainder of my day grinding my teeth, pacing my overlarge rooms, and trying not to think about how many days I had left before the span note on my lute expired.\nSmall wonder that a knock on that fourth day sent me scrambling for the", "door. I hoped it was a summons from the Maer, but at this point, any distraction would be welcome.\nI opened the door to reveal an older man, a gentleman down to his bones. His clothes gave him away, certainly, but more important was the fact that he wore his wealth with the comfortable indifference of someone born into it. New-made nobles, pretenders, and rich merchants simply don\u2019t carry themselves the same way.\nAlveron\u2019s manservant, for example, had finer clothes than half the gentry, but despite the self-assurance Stapes possessed, he looked like a baker wearing his holiday best.\nThanks to Alveron\u2019s tailors, I was dressed as well as anyone. The colors were good on me, leaf green, black, and burgundy, with silver workings on the cuff and collar. However, unlike Stapes, I wore the clothes with the casual ease of nobility. True, the brocade itched. True, the buttons, buckles, and endless layers made every outfit stiff and awkward as a suit of mercenary\u2019s leathers. But I lounged in it as easily as if it were a second skin. It was a costume, you see, and I played my part as only a trouper can.\nAs I was saying, I opened the door to see an older gentleman standing in the hall.\n\u201cSo you\u2019re Kvothe, are you?\u201d he asked.\nI nodded, caught slightly off my stride. The custom in northern Vintas was to send a servant ahead to request a meeting. The runner brought a note and a ring with the noble\u2019s name inscribed.You sent a gold ring to request a meeting with a noble of higher rank than yourself, silver for someone of roughly the same rank, and iron for someone beneath you.\nI didn\u2019t have any rank, of course. No title, no lands, no family, and no blood. I was lowborn as they come, but no one here knew that. Everyone assumed the mysterious red-haired man spending time with Alveron was some flavor of nobility, and my origin and standing was a much-debated topic.\nThe important thing was that I had not been officially introduced to the court. As such, I had no official ranking. That meant all the rings sent to me were iron. And one does not typically refuse a request sent with an iron ring, lest one offend one\u2019s betters.\nSo it was rather surprising to find this older gentleman standing outside the door. Obviously noble, but unannounced and uninvited.\n\u201cYou may call me Bredon,\u201d he said, looking me in the eye. \u201cDo you know", "how to play tak?\u201d\nI shook my head, unsure what to make of this.\nHe gave a small, disappointed sigh. \u201cAh well, I can teach you.\u201d He thrust a\nblack velvet sack toward me and I took hold of it with both hands. It felt as if it were full of small, smooth stones.\nBredon gestured behind him, and a pair of young men bustled into my room carrying a small table. I stepped out of their way, and Bredon swept through the door in their wake. \u201cSet it by the window,\u201d he directed them, pointing with his walking stick. \u201cAnd bring some chairs\u2014No, the rail-back chairs.\u201d\nIn a short moment everything was arranged to his satisfaction. The two servants left, and Bredon turned to me with an apologetic look on his face. \u201cYou\u2019ll forgive an old man a dramatic entrance, I hope?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said graciously. \u201cPlease have a seat.\u201d I gestured toward the new table by the window.\n\u201cSuch aplomb,\u201d he chuckled, leaning his walking stick against the window sill. The sunlight caught on the polished silver handle wrought in the shape of a snarling wolf \u2019s head.\nBredon was older. Not elderly by any means, but what I consider grandfather old. His colors weren\u2019t colors at all, merely ash grey and a dark charcoal. His hair and beard were pure white, and all cut to the same length, making a frame for his face. As he sat there, peering at me with his lively brown eyes, he reminded me of an owl.\nI took a seat across from him and wondered idly how he was going to attempt to wheedle information out of me. He\u2019d obviously brought a game. Perhaps he\u2019d try to gamble it out of me. That would be a new approach at least.\nHe smiled at me. An honest smile I found myself returning before I realized what I was doing. \u201cYou must have a fair collection of rings by this point,\u201d he said.\nI nodded.\nHe leaned forward curiously. \u201cWould you mind terribly if I looked them over?\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d I went into the other room and brought back a handful of rings, spilling them onto the table.\nHe looked them over, nodding to himself. \u201cYou\u2019ve had all our best gossipmongers descend on you. Veston, Praevek, and Temenlovy have all", "taken a crack.\u201d His eyebrows went up as he saw the name on another ring. \u201cPraevek twice. And none of them got a shred of anything out of you. Nothing half as solid as a whisper.\u201d\nBredon glanced up at me. \u201cThat tells me you are keeping your tongue tightly between your teeth, and you are good at it. Rest assured, I\u2019m not here in some vain attempt to pry at your secrets.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t entirely believe him, but it was nice to hear. \u201cI\u2019ll admit that\u2019s a relief.\u201d\n\u201cAs a brief aside,\u201d he mentioned casually. \u201cI\u2019ll mention the rings are traditionally left in the sitting room near the door. They are displayed as a mark of status.\u201d\nI hadn\u2019t known that, but I didn\u2019t want to admit to it. If I was unfamiliar with the customs of the local court, it would let him know I was either a foreigner or not one of the gentry. \u201cThere\u2019s no real status in a handful of iron,\u201d I said dismissively. Count Threpe had explained the basics of the rings to me before I left Imre. But he wasn\u2019t from Vintas, and obviously hadn\u2019t known the fine points.\n\u201cThere\u2019s some truth to that,\u201d Bredon said easily. \u201cBut not the truth entire. Gold rings imply those below you are working to curry your favor. Silver indicates a healthy working relationship with your peers.\u201d He laid the rings in a row on the table. \u201cHowever, iron means you have the attention of your betters. It indicates you are desirable.\u201d\nI nodded slowly. \u201cOf course,\u201d I said. \u201cAny ring the Maer sends will be an iron one.\u201d\n\u201cExactly.\u201d Bredon nodded. \u201cTo have a ring from the Maer is a mark of great favor.\u201d He pushed the rings toward me across the top of the smooth marble table. \u201cBut there is no such ring here, and that itself is meaningful.\u201d\n\u201cIt seems you\u2019re no stranger to courtly politics yourself,\u201d I pointed out.\nBredon closed his eyes and nodded a weary agreement. \u201cI was quite fond of it when I was young. I was even something of a power, as these things go. But at present, I have no machinations to advance. That takes the spice from such maneuverings.\u201d He looked at me again, meeting my eyes directly.\u201cI have simpler tastes now. I travel. I enjoy wines and conversation with interesting people. I\u2019ve even been learning how to dance.\u201d\nHe smiled again, warmly, and rapped a knuckle on the board. \u201cMore than anything, however, I enjoy playing tak. However, I know few people with time or wit enough to play the game properly.\u201d He raised an eyebrow at me.", "I hesitated. \u201cOne might assume that someone well-skilled in the subtle art of conversation could use long stretches of idle chatter to glean information from an unsuspecting victim.\u201d\nBredon smiled. \u201cBy the names on these rings, I can tell you\u2019ve seen nothing but the most gaudy and grasping of us. You\u2019re understandably skittish regarding your secrets, whatever they may be.\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cConsider this instead. Those who have approached you are like magpies. They caw and flap around you, hoping to snatch something bright to carry home with them.\u201d He rolled his eyes disdainfully. \u201cWhat gain is there in that? Some small notoriety, I suppose. Some brief elevation among one\u2019s gaudy, gossipy peers.\u201d\nBredon ran a hand over his white beard. \u201cI am no magpie. I need nothing shiny, nor do I care what gossipmongers think. I play a longer, more subtle game.\u201d He began to work the drawstring loose on the black velvet bag. \u201cYou are a man of some wit. I know this as the Maer does not waste his time with fools. I know you either stand in the Maer\u2019s good grace, or you have a chance to gain that grace. So here is my plan.\u201d He smiled his warm smile again. \u201cWould you like to hear my plan?\u201d\nI found myself smiling back without meaning to, as I had before. \u201cThat would be unusually kind of you.\u201d\n\u201cMy plan is to insinuate myself into your favor now. I will make myself useful and entertaining. I will provide conversation and a way to pass the time.\u201d He spilled a set of round stones out onto the marble tabletop. \u201cThen, when your star grows ascendant in the Maer\u2019s sky, I may find myself in possession of an unexpectedly useful friend.\u201d He began to sort the stones into their different colors. \u201cAnd should your star fail to rise, I am still richer by several games of tak.\u201d\n\u201cI also imagine it won\u2019t hurt your reputation to spend several hours alone with me,\u201d I mentioned. \u201cGiven that all my other conversations have been barren things not likely to last a quarter hour.\u201d\n\u201cThere is some truth to that as well,\u201d he said as he began to arrange the stones. His curious brown eyes smiled at me again. \u201cOh yes, I think I\u2019m going to have quite a bit of fun playing with you.\u201d\n \nMy next several hours were spent learning how to play tak. Even if I had not been nearly mad with idleness, I would have enjoyed it. Tak is the best sort of game: simple in its rules, complex in its strategy. Bredon beat me handily in all five games we played, but I am proud to say that he never beat me the same way twice.\nAfter the fifth game he leaned back with a satisfied sigh. \u201cThat was approaching a good game. You got clever in the corner here.\u201d He wiggled his fingers at the edge of the board.\n\u201cNot clever enough.\u201d\n\u201cClever nonetheless. What you attempted is called a brooker\u2019s fall, just so you know.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s the name for the way you got away from it?\u201d\n\u201cI call it Bredon\u2019s defense,\u201d he said, smiling rakishly. \u201cBut that\u2019s what I call any maneuver when I get out of a tight corner by being uncommonly clever.\u201d\nI laughed and began to separate the stones again. \u201cAnother?\u201d\nBredon sighed. \u201cAlas, I have an unavoidable appointment. I needn\u2019t hurry out the door, but I don\u2019t have enough time for another game. Not a proper one.\u201d\nHis brown eyes looked me over as he began to gather the stones into the velvet bag. \u201cI won\u2019t insult you by asking if you\u2019re familiar with the local customs,\u201d Bredon said. \u201cHowever, I thought I might give a few general pieces of advice, on the off chance they might be helpful.\u201d He smiled at me. \u201cIt would be best to listen, of course. If you refuse, you reveal your knowledge of these things.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said with a straight face.\nBredon slid open the table\u2019s drawer and pulled out the handful of iron rings we had swept aside to clear the board for our game. \u201cThe presentation of the rings implies a great deal. If they are jumbled in a bowl for example, it implies disinterest in the social aspects of the court.\u201d\nHe arranged the rings with their engraved names facing me. \u201cLaid out in careful display, they show you are proud of your connections.\u201d He looked up and smiled. \u201cEither way, a new arrival is usually left alone in the sitting room on some pretext. This gives them a chance to paw through your collection in order to satisfy their curiosity.\u201d\nShrugging, Bredon pushed the rings toward me. \u201cYou have, of course, always made a point of offering to return the rings to their owners.\u201d He was", "careful not to make it into a question.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said honestly. Threpe had known that much.\n\u201cIt is the most polite thing to do.\u201d He looked up at me, his brown eyes\npeering owlishly from the halo of his white hair and beard. \u201cHave you worn any of them in public?\u201d\nI held up my bare hands.\n\u201cWearing a ring can indicate a debt, or that you are attempting to curry favor.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cIf the Maer ever declines to take his ring back from you, it would be an indication he was willing to make your connection somewhat more formal.\u201d\n\u201cAnd not wearing the ring would be viewed as a slight,\u201d I said.\nBredon smiled. \u201cPerhaps. It is one thing to display a ring in your sitting room, quite another to display it on your hand. Wearing the ring of one\u2019s better can be viewed as quite presumptuous. Also, if you wore another noble\u2019s ring while visiting the Maer, he might take it amiss. As if someone had poached you from his forest.\u201d\nHe leaned back in his chair. \u201cI mention these things as general talking points,\u201d he said, \u201csuspecting this information is already well known to you, and you are politely letting an old man ramble.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps I am still reeling from a series of numbing defeats at tak,\u201d I said.\nHe waved my comment away, and I noticed he wore no rings of any sort on his fingers. \u201cYou took to it quickly, like a baron at a brothel, as they say. I expect you\u2019ll prove a decent challenge after a month or so.\u201d\n\u201cWait and see,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll beat you the next time we play.\u201d\nBredon chuckled. \u201cI like to hear that.\u201d He reached into his pocket and pulled out a smaller velvet bag. \u201cI have also brought you a small gift.\u201d\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly,\u201d I said reflexively. \u201cYou\u2019ve already provided me with an afternoon\u2019s entertainment.\u201d\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he said, pushing the bag across the table. \u201cI must insist. These are yours without obligation, let, or lien. A freely given gift.\u201d\nI upended the bag and three rings chimed into my palm. Gold, silver, and iron. Each of them had my name etched into the metal: Kvothe.\n\u201cI heard a rumor your luggage was lost,\u201d Bredon said. \u201cAnd thought these might prove useful.\u201d He smiled. \u201cEspecially if you desire another game of tak.\u201d\nI rolled the rings around in my hand, idly wondering if the gold ring was solid or simply plated. \u201cAnd what ring would I send my new acquaintance if I", "desired his company?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Bredon said slowly. \u201cThat is complicated. By my rash and\nunseemly barging into your rooms, I have neglected a proper introduction and failed to inform you as to my title and rank.\u201d His brown eyes looked into mine seriously.\n\u201cAnd it would be terribly rude of me to inquire about such things,\u201d I said slowly, not quite sure what he was playing at.\nHe nodded. \u201cSo for now, you must assume I am without either title or rank. That puts us on a curious footing: you unannounced to the court, and myself unannounced to you. As such, it would be fitting for you to send me a silver ring if, in the future, you would like to share a lunch or graciously lose another game of tak.\u201d\nI rolled the silver ring around in my fingers. If I sent it to him, rumor would get around that I was claiming a rank roughly equal to his, and I had no idea what rank that was. \u201cWhat will people say?\u201d\nHis eyes danced a bit. \u201cWhat indeed?\u201d\nSo the days continued to pass. The Maer summoned me for urbane chatter. Magpie nobles sent their cards and rings and were met with polite conversational rebuffment.\nBredon alone kept me from growing mad with caged boredom. The next day I sent him my new silver ring with a card saying, \u201cAt your leisure. My rooms.\u201d Five minutes later he arrived with his tak table and bag of stones. He offered my ring back to me and I accepted it as graciously as possible. I wouldn\u2019t have minded him keeping it. But as he knew, I only had the one.\nOur fifth game was interrupted when I was summoned by the Maer, his ring of iron sitting darkly on the runner\u2019s polished silver tray. I made my apologies to Bredon and hurried off to the gardens.\nLater that night Bredon sent me his own silver ring and a card saying, \u201cAfter supper.Your rooms.\u201d I wrote \u201cDelighted\u201d on the card and sent it back.\nWhen he arrived, I offered to return his ring. He politely declined and it joined the rest in the bowl by my door. It sat there for everyone to see, bright silver glittering among the handful of iron.\n \nCHAPTER FIFTY-EIGHT\nCourting\nTHE MAER HAD NOT called on me for two days.\nI was trapped in my rooms, and near mad with boredom and irritation.\nWorst was the fact that I didn\u2019t know why the Maer wasn\u2019t calling on me. Was he busy? Had I offended him? I thought of sending him a card along with the gold ring Bredon had given me. But if Alveron were testing my patience, that could be a grave mistake.\nBut I was impatient. I had come here to gain a patron, or at least some assistance in my pursuit of the Amyr. So far, all I had to show for my time in the Maer\u2019s service was a profoundly flattened ass. If it hadn\u2019t been for Bredon, I swear I would have gone frothing mad.\nWorse, my lute and Denna\u2019s lovely case were only two days away from becoming someone else\u2019s property. I had hoped by this point to have gained enough of the Maer\u2019s favor that I could ask him for the money I needed to get it out of pawn. I\u2019d wanted him to be indebted to me, not the other way around. Once you owe something to a member of the nobility, it is notoriously difficult to work your way free of their debt.\nBut if Alveron\u2019s lack of summons was any indication, I seemed to be far from his good graces. I racked my memory, trying to think of what I might have said during our last conversation that could have offended him.\nI\u2019d pulled a card from the drawer and was trying to think of a politic way of asking the Maer for money when a knock came at the door. Thinking it was my lunch come early, I called for the boy to leave it on the table.\nThere was a significant pause that roused me from my reverie. I hurried to the door and was startled to see the Maer\u2019s manservant, Stapes, standing outside. Alveron\u2019s summons had always been delivered by runner before.\n\u201cThe Maer would like to see you,\u201d he said. I noticed the manservant looked worn around the edges. His eyes were weary, as if he hadn\u2019t been sleeping enough.\n\u201cIn the garden?\u201d", "\u201cIn his rooms,\u201d Stapes said. \u201cI will take you there.\u201d\nIf the gossiping courtiers were to be believed, Alveron rarely received visitors in his rooms. As I fell into step behind Stapes, I couldn\u2019t help but feel relief. Anything was better than waiting.\nAlveron was propped upright in his great feather bed. He seemed paler and thinner than when I\u2019d seen him last. His eyes were still clear and sharp, but today they held something else, some hard emotion.\nHe gestured to a nearby chair. \u201cKvothe. Come in. Sit down.\u201d His voice was weaker too, but it still carried the weight of command. I sat at his bedside, sensing the time was not appropriate for thanking him for the privilege.\n\u201cDo you know how old I am, Kvothe?\u201d he said without preamble. \u201cNo, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cWhat would your guess be? How old do I seem?\u201d I caught the hard\nemotion in his eyes again: anger. A slow, smoldering anger, like hot coals beneath a thin layer of ash.\nMy mind raced, trying to decide what the best answer might be. I didn\u2019t want to risk giving offense, but flattery irritated the Maer unless it was done with consummate subtlety and skill.\nMy last resort then. Honesty. \u201cFifty-one, your grace. Perhaps fifty-two.\u201d\nHe nodded slowly, his anger seeming to fade like thunder in the distance. \u201cNever ask a young man your age. I am forty, with a birthday next span. You\u2019re right though, I look fifty years if I look a day. Some might even say you were being generous.\u201d His hands smoothed the bedcovers absently. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible thing, growing old before your time.\u201d\nHe stiffened in pain, grimacing. After a moment it passed, and he drew a deep breath. A faint sheen of sweat covered his face. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll be able to speak with you. I don\u2019t seem to be doing very well today.\u201d\nI stood. \u201cShould I fetch Caudicus, your grace?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he spat. \u201cSit down.\u201d\nI did.\n\u201cThis damnable sickness has crept on me this last month, adding years and\nmaking me feel them. I have spent my life tending to my lands, but I have been lax in one regard. I have no family, no heir.\u201d\n \n\u201cDo you mean to take a wife, your grace?\u201d\nHe sagged against his pillows. \u201cThe rumor has finally gotten around, has it?\u201d\n\u201cNo, your grace. I guessed it from what you\u2019ve said in some of our conversations.\u201d\nHe gave me a penetrating look. \u201cTruthfully? A guess and not from a rumor?\u201d\n\u201cTruthfully, your grace. There are rumors, a whole courtload, if you\u2019ll excuse the expression.\u201d\n\u201c \u2018Courtload.\u2019 That\u2019s good.\u201d He smiled a thin whisper of a smile.\n\u201cBut most of it concerns some mysterious visitor from the west.\u201d I performed a small seated bow. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing of marriage. Everyone sees you as the world\u2019s first bachelor.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d he said, his face showing his relief. \u201cThat used to be the case. My father tried to marry me off when I was younger. I was rather strong-headed about not taking a wife at the time. That\u2019s another problem with power. If you possess too much, people don\u2019t dare point out your mistakes. Power can be a terrible thing.\u201d\n\u201cI imagine so, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cIt takes away your choices,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gives a man opportunities, but at the same time it takes others away. My situation is difficult, to say the least.\u201d\nOver the course of my life I\u2019ve been hungry too many times to feel much empathy for the nobility. But the Maer looked so pale and weak as he lay there that I felt a flicker of sympathy. \u201cWhat situation is that, your grace?\u201d\nAlveron struggled to sit upright against his pillows. \u201cIf I am to be married, it must be to someone suitable. Someone from a family well-positioned as my own. Not only that, but this cannot be a marriage of alliance. The girl must be young enough to\u2014\u201d He cleared his throat, a papery noise. \u201cProduce an heir. Several if possible.\u201d He looked up at me. \u201cDo you begin to see my problem?\u201d\nI nodded slowly. \u201cJust the bare shape of it, your grace. How many such daughters are there?\u201d\n\u201cA bare handful,\u201d Alveron said, a hint of the old fire coming back to his voice. \u201cBut it can\u2019t be one of the young women the king has under his control. Bargaining chips and treaty sealers. My family has fought to hold our plenary powers since the founding of Vintas. I won\u2019t negotiate with that bastard Roderic for a wife. I won\u2019t remit a grain of power to him.\u201d\n\u201cHow many women are beyond the king\u2019s control, your grace?\u201d", "\u201cOne.\u201d The word fell like a lead weight. \u201cAnd that is not the worst of it. The woman is perfect in every way. Her family is respectable. She is educated. Young. Beautiful.\u201d The last word seemed to come hard to him.\n\u201cShe is pursued by a flock of love-struck courtiers, strong young men with honey on their tongues. They want her for every reason, her name, her land, her wit.\u201d He gave a long pause. \u201cHow will she respond to the courting of a sick old man who walks with a stick when he can walk at all?\u201d His mouth twisted, as if the words were bitter.\n\u201cBut surely your position . . .\u201d I began.\nHe lifted a hand and looked me squarely in the eye. \u201cWould you marry a woman you had bought?\u201d\nI looked down. \u201cNo, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cNeither will I. The thought of using my position to persuade this girl to marry me is . . . distasteful.\u201d\nWe were quiet for a moment. Outside the window I watched two squirrels chase each other around the tall trunk of an ash tree. \u201cYour grace, if I am going to help you pay court to this lady . . .\u201d I felt the heat of the Maer\u2019s anger before I turned to see it. \u201cI beg pardon, your grace. I\u2019ve overstepped myself.\u201d\n\u201cIs this another one of your guesses then?\u201d\n\u201cYes, your grace.\u201d\nHe seemed to struggle with himself for a moment. Then he sighed, and the\ntension in the room faded. \u201cI must ask your pardon. This clawing pain wears my temper thin, and it is not my custom to discuss personal matters with strangers, much less have them guessed from underneath me. Tell me the rest of what you guess. Be bold, if you must.\u201d\nI breathed a little easier. \u201cI guess you want to marry this woman. To suit your duty, primarily, but also because you love her.\u201d\nThere was another pause, not so bad as the last one, but tense nonetheless. \u201cLove,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cis a word the foolish use too often. She is worthy of love, that is certain. And I have a fondness for her.\u201d He looked uncomfortable. \u201cThat is all I will say.\u201d He turned to look at me. \u201cCan I count on your discretion?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, your grace. But why so secretive about it?\u201d\n\u201cI prefer to move at a time of my own choosing. Rumor forces us to act before we are ready, or ruins a situation before it becomes fully ripe.\u201d\n\u201cI understand. What is the lady\u2019s name?\u201d", "\u201cMeluan Lackless,\u201d he said her name carefully. \u201cNow, I have discovered for myself that you are charming and well-mannered. What\u2019s more, Count Threpe assures me you are a great maker and player of songs. These things are exactly what I need. Will you enter my service in this regard?\u201d\nI hesitated. \u201cHow exactly will your grace be putting me to use?\u201d\nHe gave me a skeptical look. \u201cI would think it rather obvious for so excellent a guesser as yourself.\u201d\n\u201cI know you hope to court the lady, your grace. But I don\u2019t know how. Do you want me to compose a letter or two? Write her songs? Will I climb balconies by moonlight to leave flowers on her windowsill? Dance with her wearing a mask, claiming your name as my own?\u201d I gave him a wan smile. \u201cI\u2019m not much of a dancer, your grace.\u201d\nAlveron gave a deep, honest laugh, but even through the joyful sound of it, I could tell the act of laughing pained him. \u201cI was thinking more of the first two,\u201d he admitted, sinking back into the pillows, his eyes heavy.\nI nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll need to know more about her, your grace. Trying to court a woman without knowing her would be worse than foolish.\u201d\nAlveron nodded tiredly. \u201cCaudicus can lay the groundwork for you. He knows a great deal about the history of the families. Family is the foundation upon which a man stands. You\u2019ll need to know where she comes from if you\u2019re to court her.\u201d He motioned me closer and held out an iron ring, his arm trembling with the effort of staying in the air. \u201cShow this to Caudicus and he will know you are on my business.\u201d\nI took it quickly. \u201cDoes he know you plan to marry?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Alveron\u2019s eyes flew open. \u201cDo not speak of this to anyone! Invent some reason for your inquiries. Fetch my medicine.\u201d\nHe lay back, closing his eyes. As I left I heard him speaking faintly: \u201cSometimes they don\u2019t give it knowingly, sometimes they don\u2019t give it willingly. Nevertheless . . . all power.\u201d\n\u201cYes, your grace,\u201d I said, but he had already fallen into a fitful sleep before I left the room.", "CHAPTER FIFTY-NINE\nPurpose\nASILEFT THE Maer\u2019s rooms, I considered sending a runner with my card and ring ahead to Caudicus. Then I dismissed the thought. I was on an errand for the Maer. Surely that would excuse a slight breach of etiquette.\nFrom the rumor mill, I knew Alveron\u2019s arcanist had been a permanent part of the Maer\u2019s court for more than a dozen years. But other than the fact that he lived in one of the estate\u2019s southern towers, I had no idea what to expect from the man.\nI knocked on the thick-timbered door.\n\u201cHold on then,\u201d the voice came faintly. There was the sound of a bolt being drawn back, and the door opened to reveal a thin man with a long, hawkish nose and curling black hair. He wore a long, dark garment vaguely reminiscent of a master\u2019s robe. \u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cI was wondering if I might borrow a moment of your time, sir?\u201d I said, my nervousness only half-feigned.\nHe looked me over, taking in my fine clothes. \u201cI don\u2019t do love potions. You can find that sort of thing down in Severen-Low.\u201d The heavy door began to inch closed. \u201cThough you\u2019d be better off with a little dancing and some roses if you ask me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here for something else,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cTwo things actually. One for the Maer and one for myself.\u201d I lifted my hand, revealing the iron ring on my palm, Alveron\u2019s name blazed in bright gold across the face of it.\nThe door stopped closing. \u201cYou\u2019d best come in, then,\u201d Caudicus said.\nThe room looked like a small University contained in a single room. Lit with the familiar red glow of sympathy lamps, there were shelves of books, tables full of twisted glassware, and far in the back, half concealed by the curving wall of the tower, I thought I could see a small furnace or kiln.\n\u201cGood God!\u201d I exclaimed, covering my mouth with one hand. \u201cIs that a dragon?\u201d I pointed to a huge stuffed crocodile that hung from one of the ceiling beams.", "You have to understand, some arcanists are more territorial than sharks, especially those who have managed to acquire luxurious court positions such as this. I had no idea how Caudicus might react to a young arcanist-in- training arriving in his territory, so I decided it was safer to play the part of a pleasantly dim, nonthreatening lordling.\nCaudicus closed the door behind me, chuckling. \u201cNo. It\u2019s an alligator. Quite harmless I assure you.\u201d\n\u201cIt gave me a bit of a start,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat is the use of such a thing?\u201d\n\u201cHonestly?\u201d He looked up at it. \u201cI don\u2019t rightly know. It belonged to the arcanist who lived here before me. It seemed a shame to throw it away. Impressive specimen, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\nI gave it a nervous look. \u201cQuite.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is this business you mentioned?\u201d He gestured to a large, cushioned chair and settled himself into a similar chair across from me. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I only have a few minutes before I will be otherwise occupied. Until then my time is yours . . .\u201d He trailed off questioningly.\nI could see he knew quite well who I was: the mysterious young man the Maer had been meeting with. I guessed he was eager as the rest to find out why I was in Severen.\n\u201cKvothe,\u201d I said. \u201cActually, the Maer\u2019s medicine is half my business.\u201d I saw a faint, irritated line appear between his eyebrows and hurried to correct whatever he might be thinking. \u201cI was speaking with the Maer earlier.\u201d I gave the barest pause, as if I was unreasonably proud of this. \u201cAnd he asked me if I might bring him his medicine after I had finished speaking with you.\u201d\nThe line disappeared. \u201cCertainly,\u201d Caudicus said easily. \u201cIt would save me the trip to his rooms. But what is the matter you wished to speak about?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d I leaned forward excitedly. \u201cI\u2019m doing research into the histories of the noble families in Vintas. I am thinking of writing a book, you see.\u201d\n\u201cA genealogy?\u201d I saw boredom begin to fog his eyes.\n\u201cOh no. There are genealogies aplenty. I was thinking of a collection of stories related to the great families.\u201d I was rather proud of this lie. Not only did it explain my curiosity about Meluan\u2019s family, it gave a reason for why I was spending so much time with the Maer. \u201cHistory tends to be rather dry, but everyone enjoys a story.\u201d\nCaudicus nodded to himself. \u201cClever idea. That could be an interesting book.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be writing a brief historical preface for each family, as an introduction", "to the stories that follow. The Maer mentioned you were quite the authority on the old families, and said he would be pleased if I called on you.\u201d\nThe compliment had its desired effect, and Caudicus puffed himself up ever so slightly. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d consider myself an authority,\u201d he said with false modesty. \u201cBut I am a bit of a historian.\u201d He raised an eyebrow at me. \u201cYou must realize the families themselves would probably be a superior source of information.\u201d\n\u201cOne would think that,\u201d I said with a sideways look. \u201cBut families tend to be reluctant to share their most interesting stories.\u201d\nCaudicus gave a wide grin. \u201cI imagine so.\u201d The grin faded just as quickly. \u201cBut I\u2019m certain I don\u2019t know any stories of that sort regarding the Maer\u2019s family,\u201d he said seriously.\n\u201cOh no no no!\u201d I waved my hands in violent negation. \u201cThe Maer is a special case. I wouldn\u2019t dream . . .\u201d I trailed off, swallowing visibly. \u201cI was hoping you might be able to enlighten me regarding the Lackless family. I\u2019m rather in the dark about them.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d he said, surprised. \u201cThey\u2019ve fallen from what they once were, but they\u2019re a treasure trove of stories.\u201d His eyes focused far away and he tapped his lips with his fingers distractedly. \u201cHow about this, I\u2019ll brush up on their history, and you can come back tomorrow for a longer talk. It\u2019s nearly time for the Maer\u2019s medicine, and it shouldn\u2019t be delayed.\u201d\nHe got to his feet and began to roll up his sleeves. \u201cThere\u2019s one thing I can remember off the top of my head, if you don\u2019t mind my rambling while I prepare the Maer\u2019s medicine.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a potion being made,\u201d I said enthusiastically. \u201cIf you wouldn\u2019t find it too distracting . . .\u201d\n\u201cNot at all. I could prepare it in my sleep.\u201d He moved behind a worktable and lit a pair of blueflame candles. I took care to look suitably impressed even though I knew they were just for show.\nCaudicus shook a portion of dried leaf onto a small hand scale and weighed it. \u201cDo you have any trouble accepting rumor into your research?\u201d\n\u201cNot if it\u2019s interesting.\u201d\nHe was silent while he carefully measured a small amount of clear liquid from a glass-stoppered bottle. \u201cFrom what I understand, the Lackless family has an heirloom. Well, not an heirloom exactly, but an ancient thing that dates back to the beginning of their line.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much odd with that. Old families are rife with heirlooms.\u201d", "\u201cHush,\u201d he said testily. \u201cThere\u2019s more to it than that.\u201d He poured the liquid into a flat lead bowl with some crude symbols carved along the outside. It bubbled and hissed, filling the air with a faint, acrid smell.\nHe decanted the liquid into the pan over the candles. From there he added the dry leaf, a pinch of something, and a measure of white powder. He added a splash of fluid I assumed was simply water, stirred, and poured the result through a filter and into a clear glass vial, stoppering it with a cork.\nHe held the result up for me to see: a clear amber liquid with a slight greenish tint. \u201cThere you go. Remind him to drink it all.\u201d\nI took the warm vial. \u201cWhat was this heirloom?\u201d\nCaudicus rinsed his hands in a porcelain bowl and shook them dry. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that on the oldest parts of the Lackless lands, in the oldest part of their ancestral estate, there is a secret door. A door without a handle or hinges.\u201d He watched me to make sure I was paying attention. \u201cThere\u2019s no way of opening it. It is locked, but at the same time, lockless. No one knows what\u2019s on the other side.\u201d\nHe nodded toward the vial in my hand. \u201cNow get that to the Maer. It\u2019ll be best if he drinks it while it\u2019s warm.\u201d He escorted me to the door. \u201cDo come back tomorrow.\u201d he smirked a bit. \u201cI know a story about the Menebras that will turn your red hair white.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I only work on one family at a time,\u201d I said, not wanting to risk getting bogged down in endless court gossip. \u201cTwo is the absolute most. Right now I\u2019m working on Alveron and Lackless. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to start a third as well.\u201d I gave an insipid smile. \u201cI\u2019d put myself all in a muddle.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a shame,\u201d Caudicus said. \u201cI travel quite a bit, you see. Many of the noble houses are eager to host the Maer\u2019s own arcanist.\u201d He gave me a sly look. \u201cThis makes me privy to some rather interesting facts.\u201d He opened the door. \u201cThink on it. And do stop back tomorrow. I\u2019ll have more on the Lacklesses at any rate.\u201d\nI was at the doors to the Maer\u2019s rooms before the vial had a chance to cool. Stapes opened the door to my knocking and led me to the Maer\u2019s inner rooms.\nThe Maer Alveron was sleeping in the same position I had left him in. As Stapes shut the door behind me, one of the Maer\u2019s eyes opened and he beckoned to me feebly. \u201cYou took your sweet time.\u201d\n\u201cYour grace, I\u2014\u201d\nHe motioned me forward again, more sharply this time. \u201cGive me my", "medicine,\u201d he said thickly. \u201cThen leave. I\u2019m tired.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s rather important, your grace.\u201d\nBoth eyes opened, and the smoldering anger was there again. \u201cWhat?\u201d he\nsnapped.\nI moved to the side of the bed and leaned close. Before he could protest my\nimpropriety, I whispered, \u201cYour grace, Caudicus is poisoning you.\u201d", "CHAPTER SIXTY\nWisdom\u2019s Tool\nTHE MAER\u2019S EYES WENT wide at my words, then narrowed again. Even in the midst of his infirmity, Alveron\u2019s wit was sharp. \u201cYou were right to speak that close and soft,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are treading dangerous ground. But speak, I will hear you.\u201d\n\u201cYour grace, I suspect Threpe did not mention in his letter that I am a student at the University as well as a musician.\u201d\nThe Maer\u2019s eyes showed no glimmer of recognition. \u201cWhich university?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cThe University, your grace,\u201d I said. \u201cI am a member of the Arcanum.\u201d\nAlveron frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re far too young to make such a claim. And why would Threpe neglect to mention this?\u201d\n\u201cYou were not looking for an arcanist, your grace. And there is a certain stigma attached to that sort of study this far east.\u201d It was the closest I could come to speaking the truth: that Vints are superstitious to the point of idiocy.\nThe Maer blinked slowly, his expression hardening. \u201cVery well,\u201d he said. \u201cPerform some work of magic if you are what you say.\u201d\n\u201cI am only an arcanist in training, your grace. But if you would like to see a bit of magic . . .\u201d I looked at the three lamps lining the walls, licked my fingers, concentrated, and pinched the wick of the candle sitting on his bedside table.\nThe room went dark and I heard his startled intake of breath. I brought out my silver ring, and after a moment it began to shine with a silver-blue light. My hands grew cold, as I had no source of heat other than my own body.\n\u201cThat will do,\u201d the Maer said. If he was at all unnerved, there was no hint of it in his voice.\nI stepped across the room and opened the shuttered windows. Sunlight flooded the room. There was a hint of selas flower, a trill of birdsong. \u201cI\u2019ve always found that taking in some air is good for whatever troubles a body, though others disagree.\u201d I smiled at him.", "He didn\u2019t return it. \u201cYes, yes. You\u2019re very clever. Come here and sit.\u201d I did so, taking a chair near his bedside. \u201cNow explain yourself.\u201d\n\u201cI told Caudicus I was compiling a collection of stories from the noble houses,\u201d I said. \u201cA handy excuse, as it also explains why I have been spending time with you.\u201d\nThe Maer\u2019s expression remained grim. I saw pain blur his eyes like a cloud passing in front of the sun. \u201cProof that you are a skilled liar hardly gains you my trust.\u201d\nA cold knot began to form in my stomach. I had assumed the Maer would accept the truth more easily than this. \u201cJust so, your grace. I lied to him and I am telling you the truth. Since he thought me nothing more than an idle lordling, he let me watch while he made your medicine.\u201d I held up the amber flask. The sunlight broke itself into rainbows on the glass.\nAlveron remained unmoved. His normally clear eyes fogged with confusion and pain. \u201cI ask for proof and you tell me a story. Caudicus has been a faithful servant for a dozen years. Nevertheless, I will consider what you\u2019ve said.\u201d His tone implied it would be a short, unkind consideration. He held out his hand for the vial.\nI felt a small flame of anger strike up inside me. It helped to ease the cold fear settling in my gut. \u201cYour grace wants proof?\u201d\n\u201cI want my medicine!\u201d he snapped. \u201cAnd I want to sleep. Please do\u2014\u201d \u201cYour grace, I can\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHow dare you interrupt me?\u201d Alveron struggled to sit upright in his bed,\nhis voice furious. \u201cYou go too far! Leave now and I may still consider retaining your services.\u201d He was trembling with rage, his hand still reaching for the vial.\nThere was a moment of silence. I held out the vial, but before he could grasp it, I said, \u201cYou have vomited recently. It was milky and white.\u201d\nThe tension in the room rose sharply, but the Maer went motionless when he heard what I said. \u201cYour tongue feels thick and heavy. Your mouth is dry and filled with an odd, sharp taste. You have had a craving for sweets, for sugar. You wake in the night and find you cannot move, cannot speak. You are struck with palsy, with colic and unreasoning panic.\u201d\nAs I spoke the Maer\u2019s hand slowly drew away from the vial. His expression was no longer livid and angry. His eyes seemed unsure, almost frightened, but they were clear again, as if the fear had awakened some sleeping caution.", "\u201cCaudicus told you,\u201d the Maer said, but he sounded far from certain.\n\u201cWould Caudicus discuss the details of your illness with a stranger?\u201d I asked pointedly. \u201cMy concern is for your life, your grace. If I must bruise propriety to save it, I will do so. Give me two minutes to speak and I will give you proof.\u201d\nAlveron gave a slow nod.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to claim to know exactly what this is.\u201d I gestured with the vial. \u201cBut most of what is poisoning you is lead. This accounts for the palsy, the pain in your muscles and viscera. The vomiting and paralysis.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve had no paralysis.\u201d\n\u201cHmmm.\u201d I looked him over with a critical eye. \u201cThat\u2019s fortunate. But there is more than simply lead in this. I\u2019m guessing this contains a goodly amount of ophalum, which isn\u2019t exactly poisonous.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it then?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s more of a medicine, or a drug.\u201d\n\u201cWhich is it then?\u201d he snapped. \u201cPoison or medicine?\u201d\n\u201cHas your grace ever taken laudanum?\u201d\n\u201cOnce when I was younger, to help me sleep through the pain of a broken\nleg.\u201d\n\u201cOphalum is a similar drug, but it is usually avoided as it is highly\naddictive.\u201d I paused. \u201cIt is also called denner resin.\u201d\nThe Maer grew paler at this, and in that moment his eyes grew almost\nperfectly clear. Everyone knew about the sweet-eaters.\n\u201cI suspect he added it because you had been irregular about taking your\nmedicine,\u201d I said. \u201cThe ophalum would make you crave it while easing your pain at the same time. It would also account for your sugar craving, your sweats, and any odd dreams you\u2019ve been having. What else did he put in here?\u201d I mused to myself. \u201cProbably stitchroot or mannum to keep you from vomiting too much. Clever. Horrible and clever.\u201d\n\u201cNot so clever.\u201d The Maer gave a rictus smile. \u201cHe didn\u2019t manage to kill me.\u201d\nI hesitated, then decided to tell him the truth. \u201cKilling you would have been simple, your grace. He could easily dissolve enough lead in this vial to kill you.\u201d I held it up to the light. \u201cGetting enough to make you sick without killing or paralyzing you, that is difficult.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? Why poison me if not to kill me?\u201d\n\u201cYour grace would have better luck solving that riddle. You know more", "about the politics involved.\u201d\n\u201cWhy poison me at all?\u201d The Maer sounded genuinely puzzled. \u201cI pay him\nlavishly. He is a member of the court in high regard. He has the freedom to pursue his own projects and travel when he wishes. He has lived here a dozen years. Why now?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI tell you it doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\u201cMoney?\u201d I suggested. \u201cThey say every man has a price.\u201d\nMaer continued to shake his head. Then he looked up suddenly. \u201cNo. I\u2019ve just remembered. I fell ill long before Caudicus began to treat me.\u201d He stopped to think. \u201cYes, that\u2019s right. I approached him to see if he could treat my illness. The symptoms you mentioned didn\u2019t appear until months after he started treating me. It couldn\u2019t have been him.\u201d\n\u201cLead works slowly in small doses, your grace. If he were going to poison you, he would hardly want you vomiting blood ten minutes after you drank his medicine.\u201d I suddenly remembered who I was talking to. \u201cThat was poorly said, your grace. I apologize.\u201d\nHe nodded a stiff acceptance. \u201cToo much of what you say is too close to the mark for me to ignore. Yet still, I can\u2019t believe Caudicus would do such a thing.\u201d\n\u201cWe can put it to the test, your grace.\u201d\nHe looked up at me. \u201cHow is that?\u201d\n\u201cOrder a half-dozen birds brought to your rooms. Sipquicks would be\nideal.\u201d\n\u201cSipquicks?\u201d\n\u201cTiny, bright things, yellow and red,\u201d I held up my fingers about two\ninches apart. \u201cThey\u2019re thick in your gardens. They drink the nectar from your selas flowers.\u201d\n\u201cOh. We call them flits.\u201d\n\u201cWe will mix your medicine with their nectar and see what happens.\u201d His expression grew bleak. \u201cIf lead works slowly, as you say, this would\ntake months. I\u2019ll not go without my medicine for months on some poorly supported fancy of yours.\u201d I saw his temper burning close to the surface of his voice.\n\u201cThey weigh much less than you, your grace, and their metabolisms are much faster. We should see results within a day or two at most.\u201d I hoped.\nHe seemed to consider this. \u201cVery well,\u201d he said, lifting a bell from his bedside table.\nI spoke quickly before he could ring it. \u201cMight I ask your grace to invent", "some reason for needing these birds? A little caution would serve us well.\u201d \u201cI have known Stapes forever,\u201d the Maer said firmly, his eyes as clear and\nsharp as I had ever seen them. \u201cI trust him with my lands, my lockbox, and my life. I do not ever wish to hear you imply he is anything other than perfectly trustworthy.\u201d There was unshakable belief in his voice.\nI dropped my eyes. \u201cYes, your grace.\u201d\nHe rang the bell, and it was barely two seconds before the portly manservant opened the door. \u201cYes sir?\u201d\n\u201cStapes, I miss being able to walk in the gardens. Could you find me a half-dozen flits?\u201d\n\u201cFlits, sir?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d the Maer said as if it he were ordering lunch. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty things. I think the sound of them will help me sleep.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do, sir.\u201d Before he closed the door, Stapes scowled at me.\nAfter the door was shut, I looked at the Maer. \u201cMight I ask your grace why?\u201d\n\u201cTo save him the trouble of lying. He hasn\u2019t the knack for it. And there is wisdom in what you said. Caution is always wisdom\u2019s tool.\u201d I saw a thin layer of perspiration covering his face.\n\u201cIf I am correct, your grace, tonight will be difficult for you.\u201d\n\u201cAll my nights are difficult of late,\u201d he said bitterly. \u201cWhat will make this one any worse than the last?\u201d\n\u201cThe ophalum, your grace. Your body is craving it. In two days you should be through the worst of it, but until then you will be in considerable . . . discomfort.\u201d\n\u201cSpeak plainly.\u201d\n\u201cThere will be aching in your jaw and head, sweating, nausea, cramps and spasms, especially in your legs and lower back. You may lose control of your bowels and there will be alternating periods of intense thirst and vomiting.\u201d I looked down at my hands. \u201cI am sorry, your grace.\u201d\nAlveron\u2019s expression was rather pinched by the end of my description, but he nodded graciously. \u201cI would rather know.\u201d\n\u201cThere are a few things that will make it slightly more tolerable, your grace.\u201d\nHe brightened a bit. \u201cSuch as?\u201d\n\u201cLaudanum for one. Just a bit, to ease your body\u2019s craving. And a few", "other things. Their names are unimportant. I can mix them into a tea for you. Another problem is that you still have a goodly deal of lead in your body that isn\u2019t going to go away on its own.\u201d\nThis seemed to alarm him more than anything I\u2019d said so far. \u201cWon\u2019t I simply pass it?\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cMetals are insidious poisons. They become trapped in your body. Only by a special effort can we leach the lead away.\u201d\nMaer scowled. \u201cDamn and bother. I hate leeches.\u201d\n\u201cA figure of speech, your grace. Only imbeciles and toad-eaters use leeches in this day and age. The lead needs to be drawn out of you.\u201d I thought about telling him the truth, that he would most likely never be rid of all of it, but decided to keep that bit of information to myself.\n\u201cCan you do it?\u201d\nI thought for a long moment. \u201cI am probably your best option, your grace. We are a long way from the University. I wager not one in ten physicians here have any respectable training, and I don\u2019t know who among them might know Caudicus.\u201d I thought for a moment longer then shook my head. \u201cI can think of fifty people better suited to the job, but they are a thousand miles away.\u201d\n\u201cI appreciate your honesty.\u201d\n\u201cMost of what I need I can find down in Severen-Low. However . . .\u201d I trailed off, hoping the Maer would understand my meaning and save me the embarrassment of asking for money.\nHe stared at me blankly. \u201cHowever?\u201d\n\u201cI will need money, your grace. The things you will need are not easy to come by.\u201d\n\u201cOh, of course.\u201d He produced a purse and passed it to me. I was a little surprised to find the Maer had at least one well-stocked purse within easy arm\u2019s reach of his bed. Unbidden, I remembered my tirade to a tailor in Tarbean years ago. What had I said to him? A gentleman is never far from his purse? I fought down an inappropriate fit of laughter.\nStapes returned shortly after that. In a surprising display of resourcefulness, he produced a dozen sipquicks in a wheeled cage the size of a wardrobe.\n\u201cMy word, Stapes,\u201d the Maer exclaimed as his manservant rolled the fine mesh cage through the doorway. \u201cYou\u2019ve outdone yourself.\u201d\n\u201cWhere would it suit you best, sir?\u201d", "\u201cJust leave it there for now. I\u2019ll have Kvothe move it for me.\u201d\nStapes looked a trifle wounded. \u201cIt\u2019s no trouble.\u201d\n\u201cI know you\u2019d be glad to do it, Stapes. But I was hoping you would fetch\nme a fresh pitcher of appledraw instead. I think it might settle my stomach.\u201d \u201cCertainly.\u201d He hurried out again, closing the door behind him.\nAs soon as the door was closed, I moved to the cage. The little gemlike\nbirds darted from perch to perch with a blurring speed. \u201cPretty things,\u201d I heard the Maer muse. \u201cI was fascinated with them as a child. I remember thinking how wonderful it must be to eat nothing but sugar all day.\u201d\nThere were three feeders wired to the outside of the cage, glass tubes filled with sugar-water. Two of them had spouts shaped like tiny selas blooms, while the third was a stylized iris. The perfect pet for nobility. Who else could afford to feed their pet sugar every day?\nI unscrewed the tops of the feeders and poured a third of the Maer\u2019s medicine into each. I held out the empty vial to Alveron. \u201cWhat do you normally do with these?\u201d\nHe set it on the table near his bed.\nI watched the cage until I saw one of the birds fly to a feeder and drink. \u201cIf you tell Stapes you want to feed them yourself, will it keep him from meddling with their food?\u201d\n\u201cYes. He always does exactly as I tell him.\u201d\n\u201cGood. Let them drain the feeders before you refill them. They\u2019ll get a better dose that way, and we\u2019ll see results faster. Where do you want me to put the cage?\u201d\nHe looked around the room, his eyes moving sluggishly. \u201cNext to the chest of drawers in the sitting room,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI should be able to see the cage from here.\u201d\nI carefully rolled the cage into the next room. When I returned, I found Stapes pouring the Maer a glass of appledraw.\nI made a bow to Alveron. \u201cWith your permission, your grace.\u201d\nHe made a gesture of dismissal. \u201cStapes, Kvothe will be returning later this afternoon. Let him in, even if I happen to be sleeping.\u201d\nStapes nodded stiffly and gave me another disapproving look.\n\u201cHe may be bringing me a few things as well. Please don\u2019t mention it to anyone.\u201d\n\u201cIf there is anything you require . . .\u201d\nAlveron gave a tired smile. \u201cI know you would, Stapes. I am simply", "putting the boy to use. I would rather have you close at hand.\u201d Alveron patted his manservant\u2019s arm, and Stapes looked mollified. I let myself out.\nMy trip to Severen-Low took hours longer than it needed to. Though I chafed at the delay, it was a necessary one. As I walked the streets, I caught glimpses of folk dogging along behind me.\nI wasn\u2019t surprised. From what I had seen of the rumor-driven nature of the Maer\u2019s court, I expected to have a servant or two watching my errands in Severen-Low. As I\u2019ve said, the Maer\u2019s court was rather curious about me at this point, and you have no idea what lengths bored nobility will go to in order to nose about in other people\u2019s business.\nWhile the rumors themselves were of no concern to me, their effects could be catastrophic. If Caudicus heard I had gone shopping through apothecaries after visiting the Maer, what steps would he take? Anyone willing to poison the Maer wouldn\u2019t hesitate to snuff me like a candle.\nSo, to avoid suspicion, the first thing I did when I came to Severen was buy dinner. Good, hot stew and rough bread. I was sick to death of elegant food that was milk-warm by the time it made its way to my rooms.\nAfterward I bought two tippling flasks, the sort normally used for brandy. Then I spent a relaxing half-hour watching a small traveling troupe perform the end of The Ghost and the Goosegirl on a street corner. They weren\u2019t Edema Ruh, but they did a good job of it. The Maer\u2019s purse was generous to them when they passed the hat.\nEventually I found my way to a well-stocked apothecary. I bought several things in a nervous, haphazard manner. After I had everything I needed and a few things I didn\u2019t, I awkwardly made inquiries with the owner about what a man might take if he was . . . having certain troubles . . . in the bedroom.\nThe chemist nodded seriously and recommended several things with a perfectly straight face. I bought a little of each, then made a bumbling attempt to threaten and bribe him into silence. By the time I finally left, he was insulted and thoroughly irritated. If anyone asked, he would be quick to tell the story of a rude gentleman interested in impotence cures. It was hardly something I was eager to add to my reputation, but at least there wouldn\u2019t be any stories making their way back to Caudicus about my purchasing\n \nlaudanum, deadnettle, bitefew, and other equally suspicious drugs.\nLastly, I bought my lute back from the pawner with an entire day to spare.\nIt nearly emptied the Maer\u2019s purse, but it was my final errand. The sun was setting by the time I made my way back to the foot of the Sheer.\nThere were only a handful of options for making your way between Severen-High and Severen-Low. The most ordinary were the two narrow staircases that cut back and forth up the face of the Sheer. They were old, crumbling, and narrow in places, but they were free, and therefore the usual choice for the common folk who lived in Severen-Low.\nFor those who didn\u2019t relish the thought of climbing two hundred feet of narrow stairway, there were other options. The freight lifts were run by a pair of former University students. Not full arcanists, but clever men who knew enough sympathy and engineering to manage the rather mundane task of hauling wagons and horses up and down the Sheer on a large wooden platform.\nFor passengers, the freights cost a penny going up and a halfpenny going down, though you\u2019d occasionally have to wait for some merchant to finish loading or unloading his goods before the lift could make its trip.\nNobility didn\u2019t use the freights. The Vintic suspicion of all things remotely arcane took them to the horse lifts. These were drawn by a team of twenty horses hitched to a complex series of pulleys. This meant the horse lifts were a little faster and cost a full silver eighth-bit to ride. Best of all, every month or so some drunk lordling would fall to his death from them, adding to their popularity by showing the breeding of the clientele.\nSince the money in my purse wasn\u2019t my own, I decided to use the horse lifts.\nI joined the four gentlemen and one lady who were already in line, waited for the lift to lower itself, then handed over my thin silver bit and stepped aboard.\nIt was no more than an open-sided box with a brass rail running around the edge. Thick hempen ropes connected to the corners, giving it some stability, but any extreme motion set the thing swaying in a most disturbing fashion. A smartly dressed boy rode up and down with each load of passengers, opening the gate and signaling the horse drivers at the top when to begin their pull.\nIt is the custom of the nobility to put their backs to Severen as they ride the lifts. Gawking was something common folk did. Not particularly caring what the nobles thought of me, I stood at the front rail. My stomach did peculiar", "things as we rose from the ground.\nI watched Severen spread out below. It was an old city, and proud. The\nhigh stone wall circling it spoke of troubled times long past. It said much of the Maer that even in these peaceful times the fortifications were kept in excellent repair. All three of the gates were guarded, and they were closed at sundown every night.\nAs the lift continued I could see the different sections of Severen as clearly as if I were looking down on a map. There was a rich neighborhood, spaced with gardens and parks, the buildings all of brick and old stone. There was the poor quarter, the streets narrow and twisting, where all the roofs were tar and wooden shingles. At the foot of the cliff a black scar marked where a fire had cut through the city at some point in the past, leaving little more than the charred bones of buildings.\nToo soon the ride was over. I let the other gentles disembark as I leaned against the railing, looking out over the city far below.\n\u201cSir?\u201d the boy who rode the lift prompted wearily. \u201cAll off.\u201d\nI turned, stepped off the lift, and saw Denna standing in the front of the line.\nBefore I had time to do anything other than stare in wonder, she turned and met my eyes. Her face lit. She cried my name, ran at me, and was nestled in my arms before I knew what was happening. I settled my arms around her and rested my cheek against her ear. We came together easily, as if we were dancers. As if we\u2019d practiced it a thousand times. She was warm and soft.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked. Her heart was racing, and I felt it thrilling against my chest.\nI stood mutely as she stepped back from me. Only then did I notice an old bruise fading to yellow high on her cheek. Even so, she was the most beautiful thing I had seen in two months and a thousand miles. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I asked.\nShe laughed her silver laugh and reached out to touch my arm. Then her eyes flicked over my shoulder and her face fell. \u201cHold on!\u201d she cried to the boy who was closing the gate to the lift. \u201cI have to catch this one or I\u2019ll be late,\u201d she said, her face full of pained apology as she stepped past me onto the lift. \u201cCome find me.\u201d\nThe boy closed the gate behind her and my heart fell as the lift began to drop from sight. \u201cWhere should I look?\u201d I stepped closer to the edge of the Sheer, watching her fall away.", "She was looking up, her face white against the darkness, her hair a shadow in the night. \u201cThe second street north of Main: Tinnery Street.\u201d\nShadow took her, and suddenly I was alone. I stood, the smell of her still in the air around me, the warmth of her just fading from my hands. I could still feel the tremor of her heart, like a caged bird beating against my chest.", "CHAPTER SIXTY-ONE\nDeadnettle\nAFTER MY TRIP TO Severen, I deposited my lute case in my room and made my way to Alveron\u2019s private rooms as quickly as possible. Stapes was not pleased to see me, but he showed me in with the same bustling efficiency as always.\nAlveron lay in a sweaty stupor, his bedclothes twisted around him. It was only then I noticed how thin he had grown. His arms and legs were stringy and his complexion had faded from pale to grey. He glowered at me as I entered the room.\nStapes arranged the Maer\u2019s covers in a more modest fashion and helped him into a seated position, propping him up with pillows. The Maer endured these ministrations stoically, then said, \u201cThank you, Stapes,\u201d in a tone of dismissal. The manservant left slowly, giving me a decidedly uncivil stare.\nI approached the Maer\u2019s bed and brought several items from the pockets of my cloak. \u201cI found everything I needed, your grace. Though not everything I hoped for. How do you feel?\u201d\nHe gave me a look that spoke volumes. \u201cIt took you a damn long time getting back. Caudicus came while you were away.\u201d\nI fought down a wave of anxiety. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cHe asked me how I was feeling, and I told him the truth. He looked in my eyes and down my throat and asked me if I had thrown up. I told him yes, and that I wanted more medicine and to be left alone. He left and sent some over.\u201d\nI felt a panic rise in me. \u201cDid you drink it?\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019d been gone much longer I would have, and to hell with your faerie stories.\u201d He brought another vial from beneath his pillow. \u201cI can\u2019t see what harm it could do. I can feel myself dying already.\u201d He thrust it toward me angrily.\n\u201cI should be able to improve matters, your grace. Remember, tonight will be the most difficult. Tomorrow will be bad. After that, all should be well.\u201d", "\u201cIf I live so long as that,\u201d he groused.\nIt was just the petulant grumble of a sick man, but it mirrored my thoughts so precisely that ice ran down my back. Earlier, I hadn\u2019t considered that the Maer might die despite my intervention. But when I looked at him now, frail and grey and trembling, I realized the truth: he might not live through the night.\n\u201cFirst, there\u2019s this, your grace.\u201d I took out the tippling flask.\n\u201cBrandy?\u201d he said with muted anticipation. I shook my head and opened it. He wrinkled his nose at the smell and sank back onto the pillows. \u201cGod\u2019s teeth. As if my dying wasn\u2019t bad enough. Cod liver oil?\u201d\nI nodded seriously. \u201cTake two good swallows, your grace. This is part of your cure.\u201d\nHe made no move to take it. \u201cI\u2019ve never been able to stomach the stuff, and lately I even vomit up my tea. I won\u2019t put myself through the hell of drinking it only to sick it back up.\u201d\nI nodded and restoppered the flask. \u201cI\u2019ll give you something to stop that.\u201d There was a pot of water on the bedside table, and I began to mix him a cup of tea.\nHe craned weakly to see what I was doing. \u201cWhat are you putting in that?\u201d\n\u201cSomething to keep you from being sick, and something to help you pass the poison out of your system. A bit of laudanum to ease your craving. And tea. Does your grace take sugar?\u201d\n\u201cNormally, no. But I\u2019m guessing it will taste like stumpwater without it.\u201d I added a spoonful, stirred, and handed him the cup.\n\u201cYou first,\u201d Alveron said. Pale and grim, he watched me with his sharp grey eyes. He smiled a terrible smile.\nI hesitated, but only for a moment. \u201cTo your grace\u2019s health.\u201d I said, and took a good swallow. I grimaced and added another spoonful of sugar. \u201cYour grace predicted it quite well. Stumpwater it is.\u201d\nHe took the cup with both hands and began to drink it in a number of quick, determined sips. \u201cDreadful,\u201d he said simply. \u201cBut better than nothing. Do you know what a hell it is to be thirsty but not be able to drink for fear of throwing up? I wouldn\u2019t wish it on a dog.\u201d\n\u201cWait a bit to finish it,\u201d I cautioned. \u201cThat should settle your stomach in a few minutes.\u201d\nI went into the other room and added the new vial of medicine to the flit\u2019s feeders. I was relieved to see they were still sipping at the medicated nectar. I", "had worried they might avoid it due to a change in flavor or some natural instinct for self-preservation.\nI also worried that lead might not be poisonous to sipquicks. I worried they might take a span to show any ill effects, not mere days I worried at the Maer\u2019s rising temper. I worried at his illness. I worried at the possibility I might be wrong about everything I\u2019d guessed.\nI returned to the Maer\u2019s bedside and found him cradling the empty cup in his lap. I mixed a second cup similar to the first, and he drank it quickly. Then we sat in silence for the space of fifteen minutes or so.\n\u201cHow do you feel, your grace?\u201d\n\u201cBetter,\u201d he admitted grudgingly. I detected a slight dullness to his speech. \u201cMuch better.\u201d\n\u201cThat is probably the laudanum,\u201d I commented. \u201cBut your stomach should be settled by now.\u201d I picked up the flask of cod liver oil. \u201cTwo good swallows, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cIs this really the only thing that will do?\u201d he asked distastefully.\n\u201cIf I had access to the apothecaries near the University, I could find something more palatable, but at the moment this is the only thing that can be done.\u201d\n\u201cGet me another cup of tea to wash it down with.\u201d He picked up the flask, took two sips, and handed it back, his mouth turned down in a ghastly expression.\nI sighed internally. \u201cIf you are going to sip it, we will be here all evening. Two solid swallows, the kind sailors use to drink cheap whiskey.\u201d\nHe scowled. \u201cDon\u2019t speak to me as if I were a child.\u201d\n\u201cThen act the part of a man,\u201d I said harshly, stunning him to silence. \u201cTwo swallows every four hours. That whole flask should be finished by tomorrow.\u201d\nHis grey eyes narrowed dangerously. \u201cI would remind you who you are speaking to.\u201d\n\u201cI am speaking to a sick man who will not take his medicine,\u201d I said levelly.\nAnger smoldered behind his laudanum-dulled eyes. \u201cA pint of fish oil is not medicine,\u201d he hissed. \u201cIt is a malicious and unreasonable request. It can\u2019t be done.\u201d\nI fixed him with my best withering stare and took the flask out of his hand. Without looking away, I drank the whole thing down. Swallow after swallow", "of the oil passed my gullet as I held the Maer\u2019s eye. I watched his face shift from angry to disgusted, then finally settle into an expression of muted, sickened awe. I upended the flask, ran my finger around the inside of it and licked it clean.\nI pulled out a second flask from a pocket of my cloak. \u201cThis was going to be your dose for tomorrow, but you will need to use it tonight. If you find it easier, one swallow every two hours should suffice.\u201d I held it out to him, still holding his eyes with mine.\nHe took it mutely, drank two good swallows, and stoppered the flask with a grim determination. Pride is always a better lever against the nobility than reason.\nI fished in one of the pockets of my rich burgundy cloak and brought out the Maer\u2019s ring. \u201cI forgot to return this to you before, your grace.\u201d I held it out to him.\nHe began to reach out for it, then stopped. \u201cKeep it for now,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve earned that much, I imagine.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, your grace,\u201d I said, careful to keep my expression composed. He wasn\u2019t inviting me to wear the ring, but allowing me to keep it was a tangible step forward in our relationship. No matter how his courtship of the Lady Lackless went, I had made an impression on him today.\nI poured him more tea and decided to finish his instructions while I had his attention. \u201cYou should drink the rest of this potful tonight, your grace. But remember, it\u2019s all you\u2019ll have until tomorrow. When you send for me, I\u2019ll brew you some more. You should try to drink as many fluids as you can tonight. Milk would be best. Put some honey in it and it will go down easier.\u201d\nHe agreed and seemed to be easing toward sleep. Knowing how difficult his night would be, I let him nod off. I gathered my things before letting myself out.\nStapes was waiting in the outer rooms. I mentioned to him that the Maer was sleeping, and told him not to toss out the tea in the pot, as his grace would be wanting it when he woke up.\nAs I left, the look Stapes gave me was not merely chilly, as it had been before. It was hateful, practically venomous. Only after he closed the door behind me did I realize what this must look like to him. He assumed I was taking advantage of the Maer in his time of weakness.\nThere are a great many such people in the world, traveling physicians with no qualms about preying on the fears of the desperately ill. The best example", "of this is Deadnettle, the potion seller in Three Pennies for Wishing. Easily one of the most despised characters in all drama, there\u2019s no audience that doesn\u2019t cheer when Deadnettle gets pilloried in the fourth act.\nWith that in mind, I began to dwell on how fragile and grey the Maer had looked. Living in Tarbean, I had seen healthy young men killed by ophalum withdrawal, and the Maer was neither young nor healthy.\nIf he did die, who would be blamed? Certainly not Caudicus, trusted advisor. Certainly not Stapes, beloved manservant. . . .\nMe. They would blame me. His condition had worsened soon after I arrived. I didn\u2019t doubt Stapes would quickly bring to light the fact that I\u2019d been spending time alone with the Maer in his rooms. That I\u2019d brewed him a pot of tea right before he had a very traumatic night.\nAt best I would look like a young Deadnettle. At worst, an assassin.\nSuch was the turning of my thoughts as I made my way through the Maer\u2019s estate back to my rooms, pausing only to lean out one of the windows overlooking Severen-Low and vomit up a pint of cod liver oil.", "CHAPTER SIXTY-TWO\nCrisis\nTHE NEXT MORNING I made my way to Severen-Low before the sun was up. I ate a hot breakfast of eggs and potatoes while I waited for an apothecary to open. When I was finished, I bought two more pints of cod liver oil and a few other oddments I hadn\u2019t thought of the day before.\nThen I walked the entire length of Tinnery Street, hoping to stumble onto Denna despite the fact that it was far too early in the morning for her to be up and about. Wagons and farmers\u2019 carts vied for space on the cobbled streets. Ambitious beggars were laying claim to the busiest corners while shopkeepers hung out their shingles and threw wide their shutters.\nI counted twenty-three inns and boarding houses on Tinnery Street. After making note of the ones Denna would probably find appealing, I forced myself back to the Maer\u2019s estates. This time I took the freight lifts, partly to confuse anyone following me, but also because the purse the Maer had given me was nearly empty.\nSince I needed to keep a normal face on things, I remained in my rooms, waiting for the Maer to send for me. I sent my card and ring to Bredon, and soon he was sitting across from me, thrashing me at tak and telling stories.\n\u201c. . . so the Maer had him hung in a gibbet. Right alongside the eastern gate. Hung here for days, howling and cursing. Saying he was innocent. Saying it wasn\u2019t right and how he wanted a trial.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t quite bring myself to believe it. \u201cA gibbet?\u201d\nBredon nodded seriously. \u201cAn actual iron gibbet. Who knows where he managed to find one in this day and age. It was like something out of a play.\u201d\nI searched for something relatively noncommittal to say. While it did sound grotesque, I also knew better than to openly criticize the Maer. \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cbanditry is a terrible thing.\u201d\nBredon began to place a stone on the board, then reconsidered. \u201cQuite a few folks thought the whole thing was in rather . . .\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cBad taste. But nobody said so very loudly, if you catch my meaning. It was", "a grisly thing. But it got the point across.\u201d\nHe finally chose the placement of his stone, and we played quietly for a\ntime.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strange thing,\u201d I said. \u201cI ran into someone the other day who didn\u2019t\nknow where Caudicus would rank in the overall scheme of things.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not terribly surprising,\u201d Bredon gestured to the board. \u201cThe giving\nand receiving of rings is a lot like tak. On the face of it, the rules are simple. In execution they become quite complicated.\u201d He clicked down a stone, his dark eyes crinkling with amusement. \u201cIn fact, the other day I was explaining the intricacies of the custom to a foreigner not familiar with such things.\u201d\n\u201cThat was kind of you,\u201d I said.\nBredon gave a gracious nod. \u201cIt seems simple at first glance,\u201d he said. \u201cA baron ranks above a baronet. But sometimes young money is worth more than old blood. Sometimes control of a river is more important than how many soldiers you can put to field. Sometimes a person is actually more than one person, technically speaking. The Earl of Svanis is, by strange inheritance, also the Viscount of Tevn. One man, but two different political entities.\u201d\nI smiled. \u201cMy mother once told me she knew a man who owed fealty to himself,\u201d I said. \u201cOwed himself a share of his own taxes every year, and if he were ever threatened, there were treaties in place demanding he provide himself with prompt and loyal military support.\u201d\nBredon nodded. \u201cIt happens more often than folk realize,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially with the older families. Stapes, for example, exists in several separate capacities.\u201d\n\u201cStapes?\u201d I asked. \u201cBut he\u2019s just a manservant, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Bredon said slowly. \u201cHe is that. But he\u2019s hardly just a manservant. His family is quite old, but he has no title of his own. Technically, he ranks no higher than a cook. But he owns substantial lands. He has money. And he is the Maer\u2019s manservant. They\u2019ve known each other since they were boys. Everyone knows he has Alveron\u2019s ear.\u201d\nBredon\u2019s dark eyes peered at me. \u201cWho would dare insult such a man with an iron ring? Go to his room and you will see the truth: there is nothing in his bowl but gold.\u201d\n \nBredon excused himself shortly after our game, claiming a prior engagement. Luckily, I now had my lute to occupy my time. I set about retuning it, checking the frets, and fussing over the tuning peg that was constantly coming loose. We had been away from each other for a long while, and it takes time to get reacquainted.\nHours passed. I discovered myself absentmindedly playing \u201cDeadnettle\u2019s Lament\u201d and forced myself to stop. Noon came and went. Lunch was delivered and cleared away. I retuned my lute and ran some scales. Before I knew it I found myself playing \u201cLeave the Town, Tinker.\u201d Only then did I realize what my hands were trying to tell me. If the Maer was still alive, he would have called for me by now.\nI let the lute fall silent and began to think very quickly. I needed to leave. Now. Stapes had seen me bring medicine to the Maer. I could even be accused of tampering with the vial I had brought from Caudicus\u2019 rooms.\nSlow fear began to knot my gut as I realized the helplessness of my situation. I didn\u2019t know the Maer\u2019s estates well enough to attempt a clever escape. On my way to Severen-Low this morning, I\u2019d gotten turned around and had to stop to ask directions.\nThe knock on the door was louder than usual, more forceful than that of the errand boy who normally came to deliver the Maer\u2019s invitation. Guards. I froze in my seat. Would it be best to answer the door and tell the truth? Or duck out the window into the garden and somehow try to make a run for it?\nThe knock came again, louder. \u201cSir? Sir?\u201d\nThe voice was muffled by the door, but it was not a guard\u2019s voice. I opened the door and saw a young boy carrying a tray with the Maer\u2019s iron ring and card.\nI picked them up. The card had a single word written in a shaky hand: Immediately.\nStapes looked uncharacteristically ragged around the edges and greeted me with an icy stare. Yesterday he\u2019d looked as if he wanted me dead and buried. Today his look implied that simply buried would be good enough.\nThe Maer\u2019s bedroom was generously decorated with selas flowers. Their\n \ndelicate smell was almost enough to cover the odors they\u2019d been brought in to conceal. Combined with Stapes\u2019 appearance, I knew my predictions of the night\u2019s unpleasantness had been close to the truth.\nAlveron was propped into a sitting position in his bed. He looked as well as could be expected, which is to say exhausted, but no longer sweating and racked with pain. As a matter of fact, he looked almost angelic. A rectangle of sunlight washed over him, lending his skin a frail translucency and making his disarrayed hair shine like a silver crown around his head.\nAs I stepped closer he opened his eyes, breaking the beatific illusion. No angel ever had eyes as clever as Alveron\u2019s.\n\u201cI trust I find your grace well?\u201d I asked politely.\n\u201cPassing fair,\u201d he responded. But it was mere social noise, telling me nothing.\n\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d I asked in a more serious tone.\nHe gave me a long look that let me know he did not approve of my addressing him so casually, then said. \u201cOld. I feel old and weak.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cBut for all that, I feel better than I have in several days. A little pain, and I am mightily tired. But I feel . . . clean. I think I\u2019ve passed the crisis.\u201d\nI did not ask about last night. \u201cWould you like me to mix you another pot of tea?\u201d\n\u201cPlease.\u201d His tone was measured and polite. Unable to guess his mood, I hurried through the preparations and handed him his cup.\nHe looked up at me after sampling it. \u201cThis tastes different.\u201d\n\u201cThere is less laudanum in it,\u201d I explained. \u201cToo much would be harmful to your grace. Your body would begin to depend on it as surely as it craved the ophalum.\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cYou\u2019ll note my birds are doing well,\u201d he said in an overly casual tone.\nI looked through the doorway and saw the sipquicks darting about in their gilded cage, lively as ever. I felt a chill at the implication of his comment. He still didn\u2019t believe Caudicus was poisoning him.\nI was too stunned to make a quick reply, but after a breath or two I managed to say, \u201cTheir health does not concern me nearly so much as your own. You do feel better, don\u2019t you, your grace?\u201d\n\u201cThat is the nature of my illness. It comes and goes.\u201d The Maer set down his cup of tea, still three-quarters full. \u201cEventually it fades entirely, and", "Caudicus is free to go off gallivanting for months at a time, gathering ingredients for his charms and potives. Speaking of,\u201d he said, folding his hands in his lap. \u201cWould you do me the favor of fetching my medicine from Caudicus?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly, your grace.\u201d I stretched a smile over my face, trying to ignore the unease settling in my chest. I cleaned up the clutter I had created while fixing his tea, tucking packages and bundles of herbs back into the pockets of my burgundy cloak.\nThe Maer nodded graciously, then closed his eyes and seemed to lapse back into his tranquil, sunlit nap.\n\u201cOur fledgling historian!\u201d Caudicus said as he gestured me inside and offered me a seat. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me for a moment, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\nI sank into the padded chair and only then noticed the array of rings on the nearby table. Caudicus had gone so far as to have a rack built for them. Each was displayed with the name facing outward. There were a great many of them, silver, iron, and gold.\nBoth my gold ring and Alveron\u2019s iron one sat on a small tray on the table. I reclaimed them, taking note of this rather graceful way of wordlessly offering the return of a ring.\nI looked around the large tower room with muted curiosity. What possible motive could he have for poisoning the Maer? Barring access to the University itself, this place was every arcanist\u2019s dream.\nCurious, I got to my feet and wandered to his bookshelves. Caudicus had a respectable library, with nearly a hundred books crowding for space. I recognized many of the titles. Some were chemical references. Some were alchemical. Others dealt with the natural sciences, herbology, physiology, bestiology. The vast majority seemed to be historical in nature.\nA thought occurred to me. Perhaps I could get the native Vintish superstition to work to my advantage. If Caudicus was a serious scholar and even half as superstitious as a native Vint, he might know something about the Chandrian. Best of all, since I was playing the dimwitted lordling, I didn\u2019t need to worry about damaging my reputation.\nCaudicus came around the corner and seemed somewhat taken aback when\n \nhe saw me standing by the bookshelves. But he rallied quickly and gave me a polite smile. \u201cSee anything you\u2019re interested in?\u201d\nI turned, shaking my head. \u201cNot particularly,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you know anything about the Chandrian?\u201d\nCaudicus looked at me blankly for a moment, then burst out laughing. \u201cI know they\u2019re not going to come into your room at night and steal you out of your bed,\u201d he said, wiggling his fingers at me, the way you\u2019d tease a child.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t study mythology then?\u201d I asked, fighting down a wave of disappointment at his reaction. I tried to console myself with the fact that this would firmly solidify me as a half-wit lordling in his mind.\nCaudicus sniffed. \u201cThat\u2019s hardly mythology,\u201d he said dismissively. \u201cOne could barely even stoop to calling it folklore. It\u2019s superstitious bunk, and I don\u2019t waste my time with it. No serious scholar would.\u201d\nHe began to putter around the room, restoppering bottles and tucking them into cabinets, straightening up stacks of papers, and returning books to their shelves. \u201cSpeaking of serious scholarship, if I remember correctly, you were curious about the Lackless family?\u201d\nI simply stared at him for a moment. With everything that had happened since, I\u2019d all but forgotten the pretense of the anecdotal genealogy I\u2019d invented yesterday.\n\u201cIf it wouldn\u2019t be any trouble,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said, I know practically nothing of them.\u201d\nCaudicus nodded seriously. \u201cIn that case you might be well-served in considering their name.\u201d He adjusted an alcohol lamp underneath a simmering glass alembic in the midst of an impressive array of copper tubing. Whatever he was distilling, I guessed it wasn\u2019t peach brandy. \u201cYou see, names can tell you a great deal about a thing.\u201d\nI grinned at that, then fought to smother the expression. \u201cYou don\u2019t say?\u201d\nHe turned back to face me just as I got my mouth under control. \u201cOh yes,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see, names are sometimes based on other, older names. The older the name, the closer it lies to the truth. Lackless is a relatively new name for the family, not much more than six hundred years old.\u201d\nFor once I didn\u2019t have to feign amazement. \u201cSix hundred years is new?\u201d\n\u201cThe Lackless family is old.\u201d He stopped his pacing and settled down into a threadbare armchair. \u201cMuch older than the house of Alveron. A thousand years ago the Lackless family enjoyed a power at least as great as Alveron\u2019s. Pieces of what are now Vintas, Modeg, and a large portion of the small", "kingdoms were all Lackless lands at one point.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was their name before that?\u201d I asked.\nHe pulled down a thick book and flipped its pages impatiently. \u201cHere it is.\nThe family was called Loeclos or Loklos, or Loeloes. They all translate the same, Lockless. Spelling was rather less important in those days.\u201d\n\u201cWhat days were those?\u201d I asked.\nHe consulted the book again. \u201cAbout nine hundred years ago, but I\u2019ve seen other histories that mention the Loeclos a thousand years before the fall of Atur.\u201d\nI boggled at the thought of a family older than empires. \u201cSo the Lockless family became the Lackless family? What reason could a family have for changing its name?\u201d\n\u201cThere are historians who would cut off their own right hands to answer that,\u201d Caudicus said. \u201cIt\u2019s generally accepted that there was some sort of falling out that splintered the family. Each piece took on a separate name. In Atur they became the Lack-key family.They were numerous, but fell on hard times. That\u2019s where the word \u2018lackey\u2019 comes from, you know. All those paupered nobility forced to scrape and bow to make ends meet.\n\u201cIn the south they became the Lacliths, who slowly spiraled into obscurity. The same with the Kaepcaen in Modeg. The largest piece of the family was here in Vintas, except Vintas didn\u2019t exist back then.\u201d He closed the book and held it out to me. \u201cYou can borrow this if you\u2019d like.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d I took the book. \u201cYou\u2019re too kind.\u201d\nThere was the distant sound of a belling tower. \u201cI\u2019m too long-winded,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve talked away our time and haven\u2019t given you anything of use.\u201d\n\u201cJust the history makes a great difference,\u201d I said gratefully.\n\u201cAre you sure I can\u2019t interest you in a few stories from other families?\u201d he asked, walking over to a worktable. \u201cI wintered with the Jakis family not long ago. The baron is a widower you know. Quite wealthy and somewhat eccentric.\u201d He raised both eyebrows at me, his eyes wide with implied scandal. \u201cI\u2019m sure I could remember a few interesting things if I were assured of my anonymity.\u201d\nI was tempted to break character for that, but instead I shook my head. \u201cPerhaps when I\u2019m done working on the Lackless section,\u201d I said with all the self-importance of someone devoted to a truly useless project. \u201cMy research is quite delicate. I don\u2019t want to get tangled up in my head.\u201d\nCaudicus frowned a bit, then shrugged it away as he rolled up his sleeves", "and began to make the Maer\u2019s medicine.\nI watched him go through his preparations again. It wasn\u2019t alchemy. I\nknew that from watching Simmon work. This was barely even chemistry. Mixing a medicine like this was closer to following a recipe than anything. But what were the ingredients?\nI watched him move through it step by step. The dried leaf was probably bitefew. The liquid from the stoppered jar was no doubt muratum or aqua fortis, some sort of acid at any rate. When it bubbled and steamed in the lead bowl it dissolved a small amount of lead, maybe only a quarter-scruple. The white powder was probably the ophalum.\nHe added a pinch of the final ingredient. I couldn\u2019t even guess what that was. It looked like salt, but then again, most everything looks like salt.\nAs he went through the motions, Caudicus nattered on about court gossip. DeFerre\u2019s eldest son had broken his leg jumping out a brothel window. Lady Hesua\u2019s most recent lover was Yllish and didn\u2019t speak a word of Aturan. There was a rumor of highwaymen on the king\u2019s road to the north, but there are always rumors of bandits, so that was nothing new.\nI don\u2019t care one whit for gossip, but I can fake interest when I must. All the while I watched Caudicus for some telltale sign. Some whisper of nervousness, a bead of sweat, a moment\u2019s hesitation. But there was nothing. Not the slightest indication he was preparing a poison for the Maer. He was perfectly comfortable, utterly at ease.\nWas it possible he was poisoning the Maer by accident? Impossible. Any arcanist worth his guilder knew enough chemistry to . . .\nThen it dawned on me. Maybe Caudicus wasn\u2019t an arcanist at all. Maybe he was simply a man in a dark robe who didn\u2019t know the difference between an alligator and a crocodile. Maybe he was just a clever pretender who happened to be poisoning the Maer out of simple ignorance.\nMaybe that was peach brandy in his distillery.\nHe tamped the cork into the vial of amber liquid and handed it to me. \u201cThere you are,\u201d he said. \u201cMake sure you take it to him straightaway. It\u2019ll be best if he gets it while it\u2019s still warm.\u201d\nThe temperature of a medicine doesn\u2019t make one whit of difference. Any physicker knows that.\nI took the vial and pointed to his chest as if I\u2019d just noticed something. \u201cMy word, is that an amulet?\u201d\nHe seemed confused at first, then and drew out the leather cord from", "underneath his robes. \u201cOf sorts,\u201d he said with a tolerant smile. At a casual glance, the piece of lead he wore around his neck looked very much like an Arcanum guilder.\n\u201cDoes it protect you from spirits?\u201d I asked in a hushed voice. \u201cOh yes,\u201d he said flippantly. \u201cAll sorts.\u201d\nI swallowed nervously. \u201cMay I touch it?\u201d\nHe shrugged and leaned forward, holding it out to me.\nI took it timidly with my thumb and forefinger, then jumped back a step. \u201cIt bit me!\u201d I said, pitching my voice somewhere between indignation and anxiety as I wrung my hand.\nI saw him fighting down a smile. \u201cAh, yes. I need to feed it, I suspect.\u201d He tucked it back inside his robes. \u201cGo on now.\u201d He made a shooing motion toward the door.\nI made my way back to the Maer\u2019s rooms, trying to massage some feeling back into my numb fingers. It was a genuine Arcanum guilder. He was a real arcanist. He knew exactly what he was doing.\nI returned to the Maer\u2019s rooms and engaged in five minutes of painfully formal small talk while I refilled the flit\u2019s feeders with the still-warm medicine. The birds were unnervingly energetic, humming and chirruping sweetly.\nThe Maer sipped a cup of tea as we talked, his eyes following me quietly from the bed. When my work with the birds was finished I made my good- byes and left as quickly as propriety allowed.\nThough our conversation hadn\u2019t touched on anything more serious than the weather, I could read his underlying message as plainly as if he\u2019d written it for me to read. He was in control. He was keeping his options open. He didn\u2019t trust me.\n \nCHAPTER SIXTY-THREE\nThe Gilded Cage\nAFTER MY BRIEF TASTE of freedom, I was trapped in my rooms again. Though I hoped the Maer was through the worst of his recovery, I still needed to be at hand should his condition worsen and he call on me. I couldn\u2019t justify even a brief trip to Severen-Low, no matter how desperately I wanted to head back to Tinnery Street with the hope of meeting up with Denna.\nSo I called on Bredon and spent a pleasant afternoon playing tak. We played game after game, and I lost each one in new and exciting ways. This time when we parted ways, he left the game table with me, claiming his servants were tired of carrying it back and forth between our rooms.\nIn addition to tak with Bredon and my music, I had a new distraction, albeit an irritating one. Caudicus was every bit the gossip he seemed to be, and word had spread about my story genealogy. So now in addition to courtiers trying to pry information out of me, I was deluged with a steady flow of people eager to air everyone else\u2019s dirty laundry.\nI dissuaded those I could, and encouraged the especially rabid to write their stories down and send them to me. A surprising number of them took time to do this, and a stack of slanderous stories began to accumulate on a desk in one of my unused rooms.\nThe next day when the Maer summoned me, I arrived to find Alveron sitting in a chair near his bed, reading a copy of Fyoren\u2019s Claim of Kings in the original Eld Vintic. His color was remarkably good and I saw no trembling in his hands as he turned a page. He didn\u2019t look up as I entered the room.\nWithout speaking, I prepared a new pot of tea with the hot water waiting at the Maer\u2019s bedside table. I poured a cup and set it at the table by his elbow.\n \nI checked the gilded cage in his sitting room. The flits darted back and forth to the feeders, playing dizzying aerial games which made them difficult to count. Still, I was reasonably certain there were twelve of them. They seemed none the worse despite three days of poisonous diet. I resisted an urge to knock the cage about a bit.\nFinally I replaced the Maer\u2019s flask of cod liver oil and found it was still three-quarters full. Yet another sign of my fading credibility.\nWordlessly I gathered up my things and prepared to leave, but before I made it to the door, the Maer turned his eyes up from his book. \u201cKvothe?\u201d\n\u201cYes, your grace?\u201d\n\u201cIt seems I am not as thirsty as I thought. Would you mind finishing this for me?\u201d He gestured to the untasted cup of tea that sat on the table.\n\u201cTo your grace\u2019s health,\u201d I said, and drank a sip. I made a face and added a spoon of sugar, stirred, and drained the rest of it with the Maer watching me. His eyes were calm, clever, and too knowing to be wholly good.\nCaudicus let me in and ushered me into the same seat as before. \u201cYou\u2019ll excuse me for a moment,\u201d he said. \u201cI have an experiment I must attend to, or I fear it will be ruined.\u201d He hurried up a set of steps that led to a different part of the tower.\nWith nothing else to occupy my attention, I eyed his display of rings again, realizing that a person could make a fair guess at his position in the court by using the rings themselves as triangulation points.\nCaudicus returned just as I was idly considering stealing one of his gold rings.\n\u201cI was not sure if you wanted your rings back,\u201d Caudicus said, gesturing.\nI looked back at the table and saw them resting on a tray. It seemed odd I hadn\u2019t noticed them before. I picked them up and slid them into an inner pocket of my cloak. \u201cThank you kindly,\u201d I said.\n\u201cAnd will you be taking the Maer his medicine again today?\u201d he asked.\nI nodded, puffing myself up proudly.\nWhen I nodded, the motion of my head made me dizzy. It was only then I\nrealized the trouble: I\u2019d drunk a full cup of the Maer\u2019s tea. There hadn\u2019t been much laudanum in it. Or rather, not much laudanum if you were in pain and\n \nbeing slowly weaned away from a budding addiction to ophalum. However, it was quite a bit of laudanum for someone like myself. I could\nfeel the effects of it slowly creeping over me, a warm lassitude running through my bones. Everything seemed to be moving a little more slowly than normal.\n\u201cThe Maer seemed eager for his medicine today,\u201d I said, taking extra care to speak clearly. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have much time to chat.\u201d I was in no condition to play the half-wit gentry for any length of time.\nCaudicus nodded seriously and retreated to his worktable. I followed him as I always did, wearing my best curious expression.\nI watched with half an eye as Caudicus mixed the medicine. But my wits were fuddled by the laudanum, and what remained were focused on other matters. The Maer was hardly speaking to me. Stapes hadn\u2019t trusted me from the beginning, and the flits were healthy as ever. Worst of all, I was trapped in my rooms while Denna waited down on Tinnery Street, no doubt wondering why I hadn\u2019t come to visit.\nI looked up, aware that Caudicus had asked me a question. \u201cBeg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cCould you pass me the acid?\u201d Caudicus repeated as he finished measuring out a portion of leaf into his mortar and pestle.\nI picked up the glass decanter and began to hand it to him before I remembered I was just an ignorant lordling. I couldn\u2019t tell salt from sulfur. I didn\u2019t even know what an acid was.\nI did not flush or stumble. I didn\u2019t sweat or stutter. I am Edema Ruh born, and even drugged and fuddled I am a performer down to the marrow of my bones. I met his eyes and asked, \u201cThis one, right? The clear bottle comes next.\u201d\nCaudicus gave me a long, speculative look.\nI flashed him a brilliant grin. \u201cI\u2019ve got a good eye for detail,\u201d I said smugly. \u201cI\u2019ve watched you go through this twice now. I bet I could mix the Maer\u2019s medicine myself if I wanted to.\u201d\nI pitched my voice with all the ignorant self-confidence I could muster. This is the true mark of nobility. The unshakable belief that they can do anything: tan leather, shoe a horse, spin pottery, plow a field . . . if they really wanted to.\nCaudicus looked at me a moment longer, then began to measure out the acid. \u201cI daresay you could, young sir.\u201d", "Three minutes later I was walking down the hall with the warm vial of medicine in my sweaty palm. It almost didn\u2019t matter whether I\u2019d fooled him or not. What mattered was that for some reason, Caudicus was suspicious of me.\nStapes stared daggers into my back as he let me into the Maer\u2019s rooms, and Alveron ignored me as I poured the new dose of poison into the flit\u2019s feeders. The pretty things hummed about their cage with infuriating energy.\nI took the long way back to my rooms, trying to get a better feel for the layout of the Maer\u2019s estate. I already had my escape route half planned, but Caudicus\u2019 suspicion encouraged me to put the finishing touches on it. If the flits didn\u2019t start dying tomorrow, it would probably be in my best interest to disappear from Severen as quickly and quietly as possible.\nLate that night, when I was reasonably sure the Maer wouldn\u2019t call on me, I slipped out the window of my room and made a thorough exploration of the gardens. There were no guards this late at night, but I did have to avoid a half-dozen couples taking moonlight strolls. There were two others sitting in close, romantic conversation, one in a bower, the other in a gazebo. The last couple I nearly trod on while cutting through a hedgerow. They were neither strolling nor conversing in any conventional sense, but their activities were romantic. They didn\u2019t notice me.\nEventually I found my way onto the roof. From there I could see the grounds surrounding the estate. The western edge was out of the question, of course, as it was pressed up against the edge of the Sheer, but I knew there had to be other opportunities for escape.\nWhile exploring the southern end of the estate, I saw lights burning brightly in one of the towers. What\u2019s more, they had the distinctive, red tint of sympathy lamps. Caudicus was still awake.\nI made my way over and risked a look inside, peering down into the tower. Caudicus was not simply working late. He was talking to someone. I craned my neck, but I couldn\u2019t see who he was speaking to. What\u2019s more, the window was leaded shut and I couldn\u2019t hear anything.\nI was about to move to a different window when Caudicus stood and began to walk to the door. The other person came into view, and even from this\n \nsteep angle I could recognize the portly, unassuming figure of Stapes. Stapes was clearly worked up about something. He made an emphatic\ngesture with one hand, his face deathly serious. Caudicus nodded several times in agreement before opening the door to let the manservant out.\nI noted Stapes wasn\u2019t carrying anything when he left. He hadn\u2019t stopped by for medicine. He hadn\u2019t stopped by to borrow a book. Stapes had stopped by in the middle of the night to have a private conversation with the man who was trying to kill the Maer.", "CHAPTER SIXTY-FOUR\nFlight\nThough no family can boast a truly peaceful past, the Lacklesses have been especially ripe with misfortune. Some from without: assassination, invasion, peasant revolt, and theft. More telling is misfortune that comes from within: how can a family thrive when the eldest heir forsakes all family duty? Small wonder they are often called the \u201cLuckless\u201d by their detractors.\nIt seems a testament to the strength of their blood that they have survived so much for so long. Indeed, if not for the burning of Caluptena, we might possess records tracing the Lackless family back far enough for them to rival the royal line of Modeg in its antiquity. . . .\nI tossed the book onto the table in a way that would have made Master Lorren spit blood. If the Maer thought this sort of information was enough to woo a woman, he was in worse need of my help than he thought.\nBut as things currently stood, I doubted the Maer would be asking me for any help with anything, least of all something as sensitive as his courting. Yesterday he hadn\u2019t summoned me to his rooms at all.\nI was clearly out of favor, and I sensed Stapes had a hand in it. Given what I had seen two nights ago in Caudicus\u2019 tower, it was fairly obvious Stapes was part of the conspiracy to poison the Maer.\nThough it meant spending all day trapped in my rooms, I stayed where I was. I knew better than to jeopardize Alveron\u2019s already low opinion of me by approaching him without being summoned first.\nAn hour before lunch Viscount Guermen stopped by my rooms with a few pages of handwritten gossip. He also brought a deck of cards, apparently thinking to take a page from Bredon\u2019s book. He offered to teach me how to play thrush, and, as I was just learning the game, agreed to play for the pittance of a single silver bit per hand.", "He made the mistake of letting me deal, and left in a bit of huff after I won eighteen hands in a row. I suppose I could have been more subtle. I could have played him like a fish on a line and bilked him for half his estate, but I was in no mood for it. My thoughts were not pleasant, and I preferred to be alone with them.\nAn hour after lunch, I decided I was no longer interested in currying favor with the Maer. If Alveron wished to trust his treacherous manservant, that was his business. I\u2019d be damned if I would spend one more minute sitting idle in my room, waiting by the door like a whipped dog.\nI threw on my cloak, grabbed my lute case, and decided to take a walk down Tinnery Street. If the Maer needed me while I was away, he could damn well leave a note.\nI was halfway into the hall when I saw the guard standing at attention outside my door. He was one of Alveron\u2019s own, clad in sapphire and ivory.\nWe stood for a moment, motionless. There was no sense in asking if he was there on my account. Mine was the only door for twenty feet in any direction. I met his eye. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d\n\u201cJayes, sir.\u201d\nAt least I still rated a \u201csir.\u201d That was worth something. \u201cAnd you\u2019re here because . . .?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m to accompany you if you leave your room. Sir.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d I stepped back into my room and closed the door behind me. Were his orders from Alveron or Stapes? It didn\u2019t really matter.\nI went out my window, into the garden, over the little streamlet, behind a\nhedgerow, and up a section of decorative stone wall. My burgundy cloak was not the best color for sneaking around in the garden, but it worked quite nicely against the red of the roofing tiles.\nAfter that I made my way onto the roof of the stables, through a hayloft, and out the back door of a disused barn. From there it was just a matter of jumping a fence and I was off the Maer\u2019s estate. Simple.\nI stopped at twelve inns on Tinnery Street before I found the one where Denna was staying. She wasn\u2019t there, so I continued along the street, keeping my eyes open and trusting to my luck.\n \nI spotted her an hour later. She was standing at the edge of a crowd, watching a street corner a production of, believe it or not, Three Pennies for Wishing.\nHer skin was darker than when I\u2019d seen her last at the University, tanned from travel, and she wore a high-necked dress after the local fashion. Her dark hair fell in a straight sheaf across her back, all except a single slender braid that hung close to her face.\nI caught her eye just as Deadnettle shouted out his first line in the play:\nI\u2019ve cures for what ails you!\nMy wares never fails you!\nI\u2019ve potions for pennies, results guaranteed! So if you\u2019ve got a dicky heart,\nOr can\u2019t get her legs apart,\nCome straightaway to my cart,\nYou\u2019ll find what you need!\nDenna smiled when she saw me. We might have stayed for the play, but I already knew the ending.\nHours later, Denna and I were eating sweet Vintish grapes in the shadow of the Sheer. Some industrious stonemason had carved a shallow niche into the white stone of the cliff, making smooth seats of stone. It was a cozy place we had discovered while walking aimlessly through the city. We were alone, and I felt myself to be the luckiest man in the world.\nMy only regret was that I didn\u2019t have her ring with me. It would have been the perfect unexpected gift to go with our unexpected meeting. Worse yet, I couldn\u2019t even tell Denna about it. If I did, I\u2019d be forced to admit I\u2019d used it as collateral for my loan with Devi.\n\u201cYou seem to be doing fairly well for yourself,\u201d Denna said, rubbing the edge of my burgundy cloak between her fingers. \u201cHave you given up the bookish life?\u201d\n\u201cTaking a vacation,\u201d I hedged. \u201cRight now I\u2019m assisting the Maer Alveron with a thing or two.\u201d\n \nHer eyes widened appreciatively. \u201cDo tell.\u201d\nI looked away uncomfortably. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t. Delicate matters and all that.\u201d I cleared my throat and tried to change the subject. \u201cWhat of you? You seem to be doing fairly well yourself.\u201d I brushed two fingers across the embroidery that decorated the high neck of her dress.\n\u201cWell I\u2019m not rubbing elbows with the Maer,\u201d she said, making an exaggerated deferential gesture in my direction. \u201cBut as I mentioned in my letters, I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLetters?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou sent more than one?\u201d\nShe nodded. \u201cThree since I left,\u201d she said. \u201cI was about to start a fourth, but you\u2019ve saved me the trouble.\u201d\n\u201cI only got the one,\u201d I said.\nDenna shrugged. \u201cI\u2019d rather tell you in person, anyway.\u201d She paused dramatically. \u201cI finally have my formal patronage.\u201d\n\u201cYou have?\u201d I said, delighted. \u201cDenna, that\u2019s wonderful news!\u201d\nDenna grinned proudly. Her teeth were white against the light nut color of her travel-tanned face. Her lips, as always, were red without the aid of any paint.\n\u201cIs he part of the court here in Severen?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d\nDenna\u2019s grin faded into a serious look, a confused smile playing around her mouth. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t tell you that,\u201d she chided. \u201cYou know how closely he guards his privacy.\u201d\nMy excitement fell away, leaving me cold. \u201cOh no. Denna. It\u2019s not the same fellow as before, is it? The one who sent you to play for that wedding in Trebon?\u201d\nDenna looked puzzled. \u201cOf course it is. I can\u2019t tell you his real name. What was it you called him before? Master Elm?\u201d\n\u201cMaster Ash,\u201d I said, and it felt like a mouthful of ashes when I said it. \u201cDo you at least know his real name? Did he tell you that much before you signed up?\u201d\n\u201cI expect I know his real name,\u201d she shrugged, running a hand through her hair. When her fingers touched the braid she seemed surprised to find it there and quickly began to unravel it, her deft fingers smoothing it away. \u201cEven if I don\u2019t, what does it matter? Everyone has secrets, Kvothe. I don\u2019t particularly care what his are so long as he continues to deal square with me. He\u2019s been very generous.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not just secretive, Denna,\u201d I protested. \u201cFrom the way you\u2019ve", "described him, I\u2019d say he\u2019s either paranoid or tangled up in dangerous business.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re carrying such a grudge against him.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t believe she could say that. \u201cDenna, he beat you senseless.\u201d\nShe went very still. \u201cNo.\u201d Her hand went to the fading bruise on her cheek.\n\u201cNo he didn\u2019t. I told you. I fell while I was out riding. The stupid horse couldn\u2019t tell a stick from a snake.\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cI\u2019m talking about last fall in Trebon.\u201d\nDenna\u2019s hand fell back to her lap where it made an absentminded fidgeting gesture, trying to toy with a ring that wasn\u2019t there. She looked at me, her expression blank. \u201cHow did you know about that?\u201d\n\u201cYou told me yourself. That night on the hill, waiting for the draccus to come.\u201d\nShe looked down, blinking. \u201cI . . . I don\u2019t remember saying that.\u201d\n\u201cYou were a little addled at the time,\u201d I said gently. \u201cBut you did. You told me all about it. Denna, you shouldn\u2019t have to stay with someone like that. Anyone who could do that to you . . .\u201d\n\u201cHe did it for my own good,\u201d she said, her dark eyes beginning to flicker with anger. \u201cDid I tell you that? There I was without a scratch on me and everyone else at the wedding dead as leather. You know what small towns are like. Even after they found me unconscious they thought I might have had something to do with it. You remember.\u201d\nI put my head down and shook it like an ox worrying its yoke. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it. There had to be another way around the situation. I would have found another way.\u201d\n\u201cWell I guess we can\u2019t all be as clever as you,\u201d she said.\n\u201cClever doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it!\u201d I came close to shouting. \u201cHe could have taken you away with him! He could have come forward and vouched for you!\u201d\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t let anyone know he was there,\u201d Denna said. \u201cHe said\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe beat you.\u201d And as I spoke the words I felt a terrible anger come together inside me. It wasn\u2019t hot and furious, as some of my flashes of temper tend to be. This was different, slow and cold. And as soon as I felt it, I realized it had been there inside me for a long while, crystallizing, like a pond slowly freezing solid over a long winter night.\n\u201cHe beat you,\u201d I said again, and I could feel it inside, a solid block of icy anger. \u201cNothing you can say will change that. And if I ever see him, I\u2019ll", "likely stick a knife in him rather than shake his hand.\u201d\nDenna looked up at me then, the irritation fading from her face. She gave\nme a look that was all sweet fondness and mingled pity. It was the sort of look you give a puppy when it growls, thinking itself terribly fierce. She put her hand gently on the side of my face, and I felt myself flush hot and hard, suddenly embarrassed by my own melodrama.\n\u201cCan we not argue about it?\u201d she asked. \u201cPlease? Not today? It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve seen you. . . .\u201d\nI decided to let it go rather than risk driving her away. I knew what happened when men pressed her too hard. \u201cFair enough,\u201d I said. \u201cFor today. Can you at least tell me what sort of thing your patron brought you out here for?\u201d\nDenna leaned back in her seat, smiling a wide smile. \u201cSorry, delicate matters and all that,\u201d she mimicked.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be that way,\u201d I protested. \u201cI\u2019d tell you if I could, but the Maer values his privacy very highly.\u201d\nDenna leaned forward again to lay her hand over mine. \u201cPoor Kvothe, it\u2019s not out of spite. My patron is at least as private as the Maer. He made it very clear that things would go badly if I ever made our relationship public. He was quite emphatic about it.\u201d Her expression had gone serious. \u201cHe\u2019s a powerful man.\u201d She seemed as if she would say more, then stopped herself.\nThough I didn\u2019t want to, I understood. My recent brush with the Maer\u2019s anger had taught me caution. \u201cWhat can you tell me about him?\u201d\nDenna tapped a finger against her lips thoughtfully. \u201cHe\u2019s a surprisingly good dancer. I think I can say that without betraying anything. He\u2019s quite graceful,\u201d she said, then laughed at my expression. \u201cI\u2019m doing some research for him, looking into old genealogies and histories. He\u2019s helping me write a couple songs so I can make a name for myself. . . .\u201d She hesitated, then shook her head. \u201cI think that\u2019s all I can say.\u201d\n\u201cWill I get to hear the songs after you\u2019re done?\u201d\nShe gave a shy smile. \u201cI think that can be arranged.\u201d She leapt to her feet and grabbed my arm to pull me to my feet. \u201cEnough talking. Come and walk with me!\u201d\nI smiled, her enthusiasm as infectious as a child\u2019s. But when she pulled at my hand, she let out a tiny yelp, flinching and pressing one of her hands to her side.\nI was standing next to her in a second. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d", "Denna shrugged and gave me a brittle smile, holding her arm close to her ribs. \u201cMy fall,\u201d she said. \u201cThat stupid horse. I get a twinge when I forget and move too quickly.\u201d\n\u201cHas anyone looked at it?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a bruise,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the sort of doctor I can afford, I wouldn\u2019t trust to touch me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat of your patron?\u201d I asked. \u201cCertainly he could arrange something.\u201d\nShe slowly straightened. \u201cIt\u2019s really not a problem.\u201d She lifted her arms above her head and made a quick, clever dance step, then laughed at my serious expression. \u201cNo more talk of secret things for now. Come walk with me. Tell me dark and lurid gossip from the Maer\u2019s court.\u201d\n\u201cVery well,\u201d I said as we began to walk. \u201cI\u2019ve heard the Maer is marvelously recovered from a long-standing illness.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a poor rumormonger,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone knows that.\u201d\n\u201cThe Baronet Bramston played a disastrous deck of faro last night.\u201d\nDenna rolled her eyes. \u201cBoring.\u201d\n\u201cThe Comptess DeFerre lost her virginity while attending a performance of\nDaeonica.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Denna raised her hand to her mouth, stifling a laugh. \u201cDid she\nreally?\u201d\n\u201cShe certainly didn\u2019t have it with her after the intermission,\u201d I said in a\nhushed voice. \u201cBut it turns out she had just left it behind in her rooms. So it was merely misplaced, not really lost. The servants found it two days later when they were cleaning up. Turns out, it had rolled underneath a chest of drawers.\u201d\nDenna\u2019s expression turned indignant. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I believed you!\u201d She swatted at me, then grimaced again, sucking a sharp breath through her teeth.\n\u201cYou know,\u201d I said softly. \u201cI\u2019ve been trained at the University. I\u2019m not a physicker, but the medicine I know is good. I could take a look at it for you.\u201d She gave me a long look, as if she wasn\u2019t quite sure what to make of my\noffer. \u201cI think,\u201d she said at last, \u201cthat might be the most circumspect route anyone has ever tried for getting me out of my clothes.\u201d\n\u201cI . . .\u201d I felt myself blush furiously. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean . . .\u201d\nDenna laughed at my discomfiture. \u201cIf I let anyone play doctor with me, it would be you, my Kvothe,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll tend to it for now.\u201d She linked arms with me and we continued our walk down the street. \u201cI know enough to take care of myself.\u201d", " I returned to the Maer\u2019s estate hours later, taking the direct route rather than come in over the rooftops. When I arrived in the hallway leading to my room, I found two guards standing there instead of the single one that had been waiting before. I guessed they had discovered my escape.\nEven this couldn\u2019t dampen my spirits overmuch, as the time I\u2019d spent with Denna had left me feeling twelve feet tall. Better yet, I was meeting with her tomorrow to go riding. Having a specific time and place to meet was an unexpected treat where Denna was concerned.\n\u201cGood evening, gentlemen,\u201d I said as I came down the hall. \u201cAnything interesting happen while I was out?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re to be confined to your rooms,\u201d Jayes said grimly. I noticed he left off the \u201csir\u201d this time.\nI paused with my hand on the doorknob. \u201cBeg pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re to remain in your rooms until we get further orders,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd one of us is to stay with you at all times.\u201d\nI felt my temper flare up. \u201cAnd does Alveron know about this?\u201d I asked sharply.\nThey looked at each other uncertainly.\nIt was Stapes giving the orders then. That uncertainty would be enough to keep them from laying hands on me. \u201cLet\u2019s get this sorted out straightaway,\u201d I said, and started down the hall at a brisk walk, leaving the guards to catch up with me, their armor clattering.\nMy temper fanned itself hotter as I made my way through the halls. If my credibility with the Maer was truly ruined, I preferred to have done with it now. If I couldn\u2019t have the Maer\u2019s good will, I would at least have my freedom and the ability to see Denna when I wished.\nI turned the corner just in time to see the Maer emerging from his rooms. He looked as healthy as I had ever seen him, carrying a sheaf of papers under one arm.\nAs I approached, irritation flashed across his face and I thought he might simply have the guards carry me away. Nevertheless, I approached him as boldly as if I had a written invitation. \u201cYour grace,\u201d I said with cheery cordiality. \u201cMight we talk for a moment?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d he replied in a similar tone as he swung open the door he had been about to close behind himself. \u201cDo come in.\u201d I watched his eyes and", "saw an anger as hot as mine. A small, sensible part of me quailed, but my temper had the bit in its teeth and was galloping madly ahead.\nWe left the bemused guards in the antechamber, and Alveron led me through the second set of doors into his personal rooms. Silence hung dangerous in the air, like the calm before a sudden summer storm.\n\u201cI cannot believe your impudence,\u201d the Maer hissed once the doors were closed. \u201cYour wild accusations. Your ridiculous claims. I mislike public unpleasantness so we will deal with this later.\u201d He made an imperious gesture. \u201cReturn to your rooms and do not leave until I decide how best to deal with you.\u201d\n\u201cYour grace\u2014\u201d\nI could tell by the set of his shoulders that he was ready to call the guards. \u201cI do not hear you,\u201d he said flatly.\nHe met my gaze then. His eyes were hard as flint and I saw how angry he truly was. This wasn\u2019t the anger of a patron or employer. It wasn\u2019t someone irritated by my failure to respect the social order. This was a man who had ruled everything around him from the age of sixteen. This man thought nothing of hanging someone from an iron gibbet to make a point. This was a man who, but for a twist of history, would now be king of all Vintas.\nMy temper sputtered and went out like a snuffed candle, leaving me chilled. I realized then that I had misjudged my situation badly.\nWhen I was a child, homeless on the streets of Tarbean, I\u2019d learned to deal with dangerous people: drunken dockworkers, guardsmen, even a homeless child with a bottle-glass knife can kill you.\nThe key to staying safe was knowing the rules of the situation. A guard wouldn\u2019t beat you in the middle of the street. A dockworker wouldn\u2019t chase you if you ran.\nNow, with sudden clarity, I realized my mistake. The Maer was not bound by any rules. He could order me killed then hang my body over the city gates. He could throw me in jail and forget about me. He could leave me there while I grew starved and sickly. I had no position, no friends to intercede on my behalf. I was helpless as a child with a willow-switch sword.\nI realized this in a flash and felt a gnawing fear settle in my belly. I should have stayed in Severen-Low while I had the chance. I never should have come here in the first place and meddled in the affairs of powerful folk such as this.\nIt was just then that Stapes bustled in from the Maer\u2019s dressing room.", "Seeing us, his normally placid expression flickered briefly into panic and surprise. He recovered quickly. \u201cI beg your pardon, sirs,\u201d he said, and hurried back the way he came.\n\u201cStapes,\u201d the Maer called out before he could leave. \u201cCome here.\u201d\nStapes slunk back into the room. He wrung his hands nervously. His face had the stricken look of a guilty man, a man caught in the midst of something dishonest.\nAlveron\u2019s voice was stern. \u201cStapes, what do you have there?\u201d Looking closer, I saw the manservant wasn\u2019t wringing his hands, he was clutching something.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing\u2014\u201d\n\u201cStapes!\u201d the Maer barked. \u201cHow dare you lie to me! Show me at once!\u201d Numbly, the portly manservant opened his hands. A tiny gem-bright bird\nlay lifeless on his palm. His face had lost all hint of color.\nNever in the history of the world has the death of a lovely thing brought\nsuch relief and joy. I had been certain of Stapes\u2019 betrayal for days now, and here was the unquestionable proof of it.\nNevertheless, I kept quiet. The Maer had to see this with his own eyes. \u201cWhat is the meaning of this?\u201d the Maer asked slowly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good to think of such things, sir,\u201d the manservant said quickly,\n\u201cand worse to dwell on them. I\u2019ll just fetch another one. It\u2019ll sing just as sweet.\u201d\nThere was a long pause. I could see Alveron struggling to contain the rage he\u2019d been ready to unleash on me. The silence continued to stretch.\n\u201cStapes,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cHow many birds have you replaced these last few days?\u201d\nStapes turned to me, his expression indignant.\nBefore he could speak, the Maer broke in. \u201cAnswer him, Stapes.\u201d His voice sounded almost choked. \u201cHas there been more than this one?\u201d\nStapes gave the Maer a stricken look. \u201cOh Rand, I didn\u2019t want to trouble you. You were so bad for a time. Then you asked for the birds and had that terrible night. Then the next day one of them died.\u201d\nLooking down at the tiny bird in his hand, his words came faster and faster, almost tumbling over each other. Too clumsy to be anything but sincere. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to fill your head with talk of dying things. So I snuck it out and brought a new one in. Then you kept getting better and they started falling four or five a day. Every time I looked there would be another one", "lying in the bottom of the cage like a little cut flower. But you were doing so well. I didn\u2019t want to mention it.\u201d\nStapes covered the dead sipquick with a cupped hand. \u201cIt\u2019s like they were giving up their little souls to make you well again.\u201d Something inside the man suddenly gave way, and he began to cry. The deep, hopeless sobs of an honest man who has been frightened and helpless for a long time, watching the slow death of a well-loved friend.\nAlveron stood motionless for a stunned moment, all the anger spilling out of him. Then he moved to put his arms gently around his manservant. \u201cOh Stapes,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThey were, in a way. You haven\u2019t done anything you can be blamed for.\u201d\nI quietly left the room and busied myself removing the feeders from the gilded cage.\nAn hour later the three of us were eating a quiet supper together in the Maer\u2019s rooms. Alveron and I told Stapes what had been happening over the last several days. Stapes was almost giddy, both at his master\u2019s health and at the knowledge it would continue to improve.\nAs for myself, after suffering a few days under Alveron\u2019s displeasure, being so suddenly in his good graces again was a relief. Nevertheless, I was shaken by how close to disaster I had been.\nI was honest with the Maer about my misguided suspicion of Stapes, and I offered the manservant my sincere apology. Stapes in turn admitted his doubts about me. In the end we shook hands and thought much better of each other.\nAs we were chatting over the last bites of supper Stapes perked up, excused himself, and hurried out.\n\u201cMy outer door,\u201d the Maer explained. \u201cHe has ears like a dog. It\u2019s uncanny.\u201d\nStapes opened the door to admit the tall man with the shaven head who had been looking over maps with Alveron when I\u2019d first arrived, Commander Dagon.\nAs Dagon stepped into the room his eyes flicked to each of the corners, to the window, to the other door, briefly over me, then back to the Maer. When\n \nhis eyes touched me, all the deep feral instincts that had kept me alive on the streets of Tarbean told me to run. Hide. Do anything so long as it took me far away from this man.\n\u201cAh, Dagon!\u201d the Maer said cheerily. \u201cAre you well this fine day?\u201d\n\u201cYes, your grace.\u201d He stood attentively, not quite meeting the Maer\u2019s eye. \u201cWould you be good enough to arrest Caudicus for treason?\u201d\nThere was a half-heartbeat pause. \u201cYes, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cEight men should be sufficient, providing they\u2019re not likely to panic in a\ncomplicated situation.\u201d\n\u201cYes, your grace.\u201d I began to sense subtle differences in Dagon\u2019s\nresponses.\n\u201cAlive,\u201d Alveron responded, as if answering a question. \u201cBut you needn\u2019t\nbe gentle.\u201d\n\u201cYes, your grace.\u201d With that, Dagon turned to leave.\nI spoke up quickly. \u201cYour grace, if he\u2019s truly an arcanist you ought to take\ncertain precautions.\u201d I regretted the word \u201cought\u201d as soon as I had said it, \u201cought\u201d was presumptuous. I should have said, You may wish to consider taking certain precautions.\nAlveron seemed to take no notice of my misstep. \u201cYes, of course. Set a thief to catch a thief. Dagon, before you settle him downstairs, bind him hand and foot with good iron chain. Pure iron, mind you. Gag and blindfold him. . . .\u201d He thought for a brief moment, tapping his lips with a finger \u201cAnd cut off his thumbs.\u201d\n\u201cYes, your grace.\u201d\nAlveron looked at me. \u201cDo you think that should be sufficient?\u201d\nI fought down a wave of nausea and forced myself not to wring my hands\nin my lap. I didn\u2019t know which I found more unsettling, the cheerful tone with which Alveron delivered the commands, or the flat emotionless one with which Dagon accepted them. A full arcanist was nothing to trifle with, but I found the thought of crippling the man\u2019s hands more horrifying than killing him outright.\nDagon left, and after the door closed Stapes shuddered. \u201cGood lord, Rand, he\u2019s like cold water down the back of my neck. I wish you\u2019d get rid of him.\u201d\nThe Maer laughed. \u201cSo someone else could have him? No, Stapes. I want him right here. My mad dog on a short leash.\u201d\nStapes frowned. But before he could make anything more of it, his eyes were drawn through the doorway into the sitting room. \u201cOh, there\u2019s another", "one.\u201d He walked to the cage and returned with another dead flit, holding its tiny body tenderly as he carried it out of the chambers. \u201cI know you needed to test the medicine on something,\u201d he said from the other room. \u201cBut it\u2019s a little rough on the poor little calanthis.\u201d\n\u201cBeg pardon?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cOur Stapes is old-fashioned,\u201d Alveron explained with a smile. \u201cAnd more educated than he cares to admit. Calanthis is the Eld Vintic name for them.\u201d\n\u201cI could swear I\u2019ve heard that word somewhere else.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s also the surname of the royal line of Vintas,\u201d Alveron said chidingly. \u201cFor someone who knows so much, you\u2019re curiously blind in places.\u201d\nStapes craned his neck to look toward the cage again. \u201cI know you had to do it,\u201d he said, \u201cBut why not use mice, or Comptess DeFerre\u2019s nasty little dog?\u201d\nBefore I could answer, there was a thump from the outer rooms and a guard burst through the inner door before Stapes could come to his feet.\n\u201cYour grace,\u201d the man said breathlessly as he jumped to the room\u2019s only window and slammed the shutters. Next he ran to the sitting room and did the same with the window in there. There followed other, similar noises from rooms farther back I had never seen. There was a faint sound of furniture being moved.\nStapes looked puzzled and half rose to his feet, but the Maer shook his head and motioned for him to sit down. \u201cLieutenant?\u201d he called out, a tinge of irritation in his voice.\n\u201cBeg pardon, your grace,\u201d the guard said as he reentered the room, breathing heavily. \u201cDagon\u2019s orders. I was to secure your rooms straightaway.\u201d\n\u201cI take it all is not well,\u201d Alveron said dryly.\n\u201cThere was no answer from the tower when we knocked. Dagon had us force the door. There was . . . I know not what it was, your grace. Some malignant spirit. Anders is dead, your grace. Caudicus is nowhere in his rooms, but Dagon is after him.\u201d\nAlveron\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cDamn!\u201d he thundered, striking the arm of his chair with a fist. His brow furrowed and he let out an explosive sigh. \u201cVery well.\u201d He waved the guard away.\nThe guard stood stiffly. \u201cSir. Dagon said I\u2019m not to leave you unguarded.\u201d\nAlveron gave him a dangerous look. \u201cVery well, but stand over there.\u201d He pointed to the corner of the room.", "The guard appeared perfectly happy to fade into the background. Alveron leaned forward, pressing the tips of his fingers to his forehead. \u201cHow in the name of God did he suspect?\u201d\nThe question seemed rhetorical, but it set the wheels of my mind spinning. \u201cDid your grace pick up his medicine yesterday?\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes. I did everything the same as I had done in days past.\u201d\nExcept you didn\u2019t send me to get your medicine, I thought to myself. \u201cDo you still have the vial?\u201d I asked.\nHe did. Stapes brought it to me. I uncorked it and ran a finger along the inside of the glass. \u201cHow does your grace\u2019s medicine taste?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve told you. Brackish, bitter.\u201d I watched the Maer\u2019s eyes go wide as I brought my finger to my mouth and touched it lightly to the tip of my tongue. \u201cAre you mad?\u201d Alveron said incredulously.\n\u201cSweet,\u201d I said simply. Then I rinsed my mouth with water and spat it as delicately as possible into an empty glass. I took a small folded packet of paper from a pocket in my vest, shook a small amount into my hand and ate it, grimacing.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Stapes asked.\n\u201cLiguellen,\u201d I lied, knowing the real answer, charcoal, would only provoke more questions. I took a mouthful of water and spat it out as well. This time it was black, and Alveron and Stapes stared at it, startled.\nI bulled ahead. \u201cSomething must have made him suspect you were not taking your medicine, your grace. If it suddenly tasted different, you would have asked him.\u201d\nThe Maer nodded. \u201cI saw him yesterday evening. He asked after my health.\u201d He beat his fist softly onto the arm of his chair. \u201cAll the cursed luck. If he has any wit, he\u2019s been gone half a day. We\u2019ll never catch him.\u201d\nI thought about reminding him that if he had believed me from the first, none of this would have happened, then thought better of it. \u201cI\u2019d advise your men to stay out of his tower, your grace. He\u2019s had time to prepare a great deal of mischief in there, traps and the like.\u201d\nThe Maer nodded and passed his hand in front of his eyes. \u201cYes. Of course. See to it, Stapes. I believe I\u2019ll take a bit of rest. This business may take a while to sort out.\u201d\nI gathered myself to leave. But the Maer gestured me back into my seat. \u201cKvothe, stay a moment and make me a pot of tea before you go.\u201d\nStapes rang for servants. While clearing the remains of our lunch away,", "they glanced at me curiously. Not only sitting in the Maer\u2019s presence, I was sharing a meal with him in his private chambers. This news would be rumored through the estate in under ten minutes.\nAfter the servants left, I made the Maer another pot of tea. I was preparing to leave when he spoke over the top of his cup, too softly for the guard to overhear.\n\u201cKvothe, you have proved perfectly trustworthy and I regret any doubts I briefly entertained about you.\u201d He sipped and swallowed before continuing. \u201cUnfortunately, I cannot allow news of a poisoning to spread. Especially with the poisoner escaped.\u201d He gave me a significant look. \u201cIt would interfere with the matter we discussed before.\u201d\nI nodded. Widespread knowledge that his own arcanist had nearly killed him would hardly help Alveron win the hand of the woman he hoped to marry.\nHe continued. \u201cUnfortunately this need for silence also precludes my giving you a reward you all too richly deserve. Were the situation different, I would consider the gift of lands mere token thanks. I would grant you title too. This power my family still retains, free from the controlment of the king.\u201d\nMy head reeled at the implication of what the Maer was saying as he continued. \u201cHowever, if I were to do such a thing, there would be need of explanation. And an explanation is the one thing I cannot afford.\u201d\nAlveron extended his hand, and it took me a moment to realize he intended me to shake it. One does not typically shake hands with the Maer Alveron. I immediately regretted that the only person present to see it was the guard. I hoped he was a gossip.\nI took his hand solemnly, and Alveron continued, \u201cI owe you a great debt. If you ever find yourself in need, you shall have at your command all the help a grateful lord can lend.\u201d\nI nodded graciously, trying to keep a calm demeanor despite my excitement. This was exactly what I had been hoping for. With the Maer\u2019s resources, I could make a concerted search for the Amyr. He could get me access to monastery archives, private libraries, places where important documents hadn\u2019t been pruned and edited as they had in the University.\nBut I knew this wasn\u2019t the proper time to ask. Alveron had promised his help. I could simply bide my time and choose what type of help I wanted most.", "As I stepped outside the Maer\u2019s rooms, Stapes surprised me with a sudden, wordless embrace. The expression on his face couldn\u2019t have been more grateful if I\u2019d pulled his family from a burning building. \u201cYoung sir, I doubt you understand how much I\u2019m in your debt. If there\u2019s anything you ever need, just make me wise of it.\u201d\nHe gripped my hand, pumping it up and down enthusiastically. At the same time I felt him press something into my palm.\nThen I was standing in the hallway. I opened my hand and saw a fine silver ring with Stapes\u2019 name etched across the face. Alongside it was a second ring that wasn\u2019t metal at all. It was smooth and white, and also had the manservant\u2019s name carved in rough letters across the surface of it. I had no idea what such a thing might signify.\nI made my way back to my rooms, almost dizzy with my sudden fortune.", "CHAPTER SIXTY-FIVE\nA Beautiful Game\nTHE NEXT DAY MY meager belongings were moved to rooms the Maer deemed more suitable for someone firmly in his favor. There were five of them in all, three with windows overlooking the garden.\nIt was a nice gesture, but I couldn\u2019t help but think that these rooms were even farther from the kitchens. My food would be cold as a stone by the time it made its way to me.\nI\u2019d barely been there an hour before a runner arrived bearing Bredon\u2019s silver ring and a card that read: \u201cYour glorious new rooms. When?\u201d\nI turned the card over, wrote: \u201cAs soon as you like,\u201d and sent the boy on his way.\nI placed his silver ring on a tray in my sitting room. The bowl next to it now had two silver rings glittering among the iron.\nI opened the door to see Bredon\u2019s dark eyes peering owlishly out at me from the halo of his white beard and hair. He smiled and bowed, his walking stick tucked under one arm. I offered him a seat, then excused myself politely and left him alone in the sitting room for a moment, as was the gracious thing to do.\nI was barely through the doorway before I heard his rich laugh coming from the other room, \u201cHo ho!\u201d he said. \u201cNow there\u2019s a thing!\u201d\nWhen I returned, Bredon was sitting by the tak board holding the two rings I had recently received from Stapes. \u201cThis is certainly a turn for the books,\u201d he said. \u201cApparently I misjudged things yesterday when my runner was turned away from your door by an altogether surly guard.\u201d\nI grinned at him. \u201cIt\u2019s been an exciting couple of days,\u201d I said.\nBredon tucked his chin and chuckled, looking even more owlish than usual. \u201cI daresay,\u201d he said, holding up the silver ring. \u201cThis tells quite a story. But this . . .\u201d He gestured to the white ring with his walking stick. \u201cThis is something else entirely. . . .\u201d\nI pulled up a seat across from him. \u201cI\u2019ll be frank with you,\u201d I said. \u201cI can", "only guess what it\u2019s made of, let alone what it signifies.\u201d\nBredon raised an eyebrow. \u201cThat\u2019s remarkably forthright of you.\u201d\nI shrugged. \u201cI feel somewhat more secure in my position here,\u201d I admitted.\n\u201cEnough that I can be a little less guarded with the people who have been kind to me.\u201d\nHe chuckled again as he lay the silver ring on the board. \u201cSecure,\u201d he said. \u201cI daresay you are at that.\u201d He picked up the white ring. \u201cStill, it\u2019s not odd that you wouldn\u2019t know about this.\u201d\n\u201cI thought there were just three types of rings,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s true for the most part,\u201d Bredon said. \u201cBut the giving of rings goes back quite a ways. The common folk were doing it long before it became a game for the gentry. And while Stapes may breathe the rarified air with the rest of us, his family is undeniably common.\u201d\nBredon set the white ring back onto the board and folded his hands over it. \u201cThose rings were made of things ordinary folk might find easily at hand. A young lover might give a ring of new green grass to someone he was courting. A ring of leather promises service. And so on.\u201d\n\u201cAnd a ring of horn?\u201d\n\u201cA ring of horn shows enmity,\u201d Bredon said. \u201cPowerful and lasting enmity.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d I said, somewhat taken aback. \u201cI see.\u201d\nBredon smiled and held the pale ring up to the light. \u201cBut this,\u201d he said, \u201cis not horn. The grain is wrong, and Stapes would never give a horn ring alongside a silver one.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNo. Unless I miss my guess, this is a ring of bone.\u201d He handed it to me.\n\u201cWonderful,\u201d I said glumly, turning it over in my hands. \u201cAnd that means what? That he\u2019ll stab me in the liver and push me down a dry well?\u201d\nBredon gave me his wide, warm smile. \u201cA ring of bone indicates a profound and lasting debt.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d I rubbed it between my fingers. \u201cI have to say I prefer being owed a favor.\u201d\n\u201cNot just a favor,\u201d Bredon said. \u201cTraditionally, a ring such as this is carved from the bone of a deceased family member.\u201d He raised an eyebrow. \u201cAnd while I doubt that is currently the case, it does get the point across.\u201d\nI looked up, still slightly dazed by it all. \u201cAnd that is. . . ?\u201d\n\u201cThat these things are not given lightly. It\u2019s not a part of games the gentry play, and not the sort of ring you should display.\u201d He gave me a look. \u201cIf I", "were you, I\u2019d tuck it safe away.\u201d\nI put it carefully into my pocket. \u201cYou\u2019ve been such help,\u201d I said. \u201cI wish I\ncould repay\u2014\u201d\nHe held up a hand, cutting me off midsentence. Then, moving with solemn\ncare, he pointed one finger downward, made a fist, and rapped a knuckle on the surface of the tak board.\nI smiled and brought out the stones.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m finally getting my teeth into the game,\u201d I said an hour later after losing by the narrowest of margins.\nBredon pushed his chair away from the table with an expression of distaste. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cQuite the opposite. You have the basics, but you\u2019re missing the whole point.\u201d\nI began to sort out the stones. \u201cThe point is that I\u2019m finally close to beating you after all this time.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bredon said. \u201cThat\u2019s not it at all. Tak is a subtle game. That\u2019s the reason I have such trouble finding people who can play it. Right now you are stomping about like a thug. If anything you\u2019re worse than you were two days ago.\u201d\n\u201cAdmit it,\u201d I said. \u201cI nearly had you that last time.\u201d\nHe merely scowled and pointed imperiously to the table.\nI set to it with a will, smiling and humming, sure that today I would finally\nbeat him.\nBut nothing could be further from the truth. Bredon set his stones\nruthlessly, not a breath of hesitation between his moves. He tore me apart as easily as you rip a sheet of paper in half.\nThe game was over so quickly it left me breathless.\n\u201cAgain,\u201d Bredon said, a note of command in his voice I\u2019d never heard before.\nI tried to rally, but the next game was worse. I felt like a puppy fighting a wolf. No. I was a mouse at the mercy of an owl. There was not even the pretence of a fight. All I could do was run.\nBut I couldn\u2019t run fast enough. This game was over sooner than the last. \u201cAgain,\u201d he demanded.\n \nAnd we played again. This time, I was not even a living thing. Bredon was calm and dispassionate as a butcher with a boning knife. The game lasted about the length of time it takes to gut and bone a chicken.\nAt the end of it Bredon frowned and shook his hands briskly to both sides of the board, as if he had just washed them and was trying to flick them dry.\n\u201cFine,\u201d I said, leaning back in my chair. \u201cI take your point. You\u2019ve been going easy on me.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bredon said with a grim look. \u201cThat is far gone from the point I am trying to make.\u201d\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d\n\u201cI am trying to make you understand the game,\u201d he said. \u201cThe entire game, not just the fiddling about with stones. The point is not to play as tight as you can. The point is to be bold. To be dangerous. Be elegant.\u201d\nHe tapped the board with two fingers. \u201cAny man that\u2019s half awake can spot a trap that\u2019s laid for him. But to stride in boldly with a plan to turn it on its ear, that is a marvelous thing.\u201d He smiled without any of the grimness leaving his face. \u201cTo set a trap and know someone will come in wary, ready with a trick of their own, then beat them. That is twice marvelous.\u201d\nBredon\u2019s expression softened, and his voice became almost like an entreaty. \u201cTak reflects the subtle turning of the world. It is a mirror we hold to life. No one wins a dance, boy. The point of dancing is the motion that a body makes. A well-played game of tak reveals the moving of a mind. There is a beauty to these things for those with eyes to see it.\u201d\nHe gestured at the brief and brutal lay of stones between us. \u201cLook at that. Why would I ever want to win a game such as this?\u201d\nI looked down at the board. \u201cThe point isn\u2019t to win?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cThe point,\u201d Bredon said grandly, \u201cis to play a beautiful game.\u201d He lifted his hands and shrugged, his face breaking into a beatific smile. \u201cWhy would I want to win anything other than a beautiful game?\u201d", "CHAPTER SIXTY-SIX\nWithin Easy Reach\nLATER THAT EVENING I sat alone in what I guessed might be my drawing room. Or perhaps my sitting room. Honestly, I wasn\u2019t entirely sure what the difference was.\nI was surprised to find I liked my new rooms quite a lot. Not for the extra space. Not because they had a better view of the garden. Not because the inlay in the marble floor was more pleasing to the eye. Not even because the room had its own exceptionally well-stocked wine cabinet, though that was quite pleasant.\nNo. My new rooms were preferable because they had several cushioned, armless chairs that were perfect for playing my lute. It\u2019s uncomfortable to play for any length of time in a chair with armrests. In my previous room, I\u2019d usually ended up sitting on the floor.\nI decided to dub the room with the good chairs my lutery. Or perhaps my performatory. I would need a while to come up with something suitably pretentious.\nNeedless to say, I was pleased by the recent turn of events. By way of celebration, I opened a bottle of fine, dark Feloran wine, relaxed, and brought out my lute.\nI started quick and tripping, playing my way through \u201cTintatatornin\u201d to limber up my fingers. Then I played sweet and easy for a time, slowly growing reacquainted with my lute. By the time I\u2019d played for about half a bottle, I had my feet up and my music was mellow and content as a cat in a sunbeam.\nThat\u2019s when I heard the noise behind me. I stopped in a jangle of notes and sprang to my feet, expecting Caudicus, or the guards, or some other deadly trouble.\nWhat I found was the Maer, smiling an embarrassed smile, like a child that\u2019s just played a joke. \u201cI trust your new rooms are to your satisfaction?\u201d\nI collected myself and made a small bow. \u201cIt\u2019s rather much for the likes of", "me, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s rather little, considering my debt to you,\u201d Alveron said. He sat on a\nnearby couch and made a gracious gesture indicating I should feel free to take a seat myself. \u201cWhat was that you were playing just now?\u201d\nI returned to my chair. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really a proper song, your grace. I was just playing.\u201d\nThe Maer raised an eyebrow. \u201cIt was of your own devising?\u201d I nodded, and he motioned to me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have interrupted you. Please, continue.\u201d\n\u201cWhat would you like to hear, your grace?\u201d\n\u201cI have it on good report that Meluan Lackless is fond of music and sweet words,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething along those lines.\u201d\n\u201cThere are many types of sweet, your grace,\u201d I said. I played the opening to \u201cViolet Bide.\u201d The notes rang out light and sweet and sad. Then I changed to \u201cThe Lay of Savien,\u201d my fingers moving quickly through the complex chording, making it sound every bit as hard as it was.\nAlveron nodded to himself, his expression growing more satisfied as he listened. \u201cAnd you can compose as well?\u201d\nI nodded easily. \u201cI can, your grace. Though it takes time to do such things properly.\u201d\n\u201cHow much time?\u201d\nI shrugged. \u201cA day or two, or three. Depending on the sort of song you desire. Letters are easier.\u201d\nThe Maer leaned forward. \u201cIt pleases me that Threpe\u2019s praise was not exaggerated,\u201d he said. \u201cI will admit I moved you to these rooms with more than gratitude in mind. A passage connects them to my own rooms.We will need to meet frequently in order to discuss my courting.\u201d\n\u201cIt should prove most convenient, your grace,\u201d I said, then chose my next words carefully. \u201cI\u2019ve learned her family\u2019s history, but that will only go so far toward courting a woman.\u201d\nAlveron chuckled. \u201cYou must take me for a fool,\u201d he said gently. \u201cI know you\u2019ll need to meet her. She will be here in two days, visiting with a host of other nobility. I have declared a month of festivities to celebrate the passing of my long illness.\u201d\n\u201cClever,\u201d I complimented him.\nHe shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll arrange something to bring the two of you together early on. Is there anything you require for the practice of your art?\u201d\n\u201cA goodly amount of paper should suffice, your grace. Ink and pens.\u201d", "\u201cNothing more than that? I\u2019ve heard tell of poets who need certain extravagancies to aid them in their composition.\u201d He made an inarticulate gesture. \u201cA specific type of drink or scenery? I\u2019ve heard of a poet, quite famous in Renere, who has a trunk of rotting apples he keeps close at hand. Whenever his inspiration fails him, he opens it and breathes the fumes they emit.\u201d\nI laughed. \u201cI am a musician, your grace. Leave the poets to their superstitious bone rattling. All I need is my instrument, two good hands, and a knowledge of my subject.\u201d\nThe idea seemed to trouble Alveron. \u201cNothing to aid your inspiration?\u201d\n\u201cI would have your leave to freely wander the estates and Severen-Low according to my will, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\nI gave an easy shrug. \u201cIn that case, I have everything I need for inspiration within easy reach.\u201d\nI had barely set foot on Tinnery Street when I saw her. With all the fruitless searching I had done over the last several months, it seemed odd that I should find her so easily now.\nDenna moved through the crowd with slow grace. Not the stiffness that passes for grace in courtly settings, but a natural leisure of movement. A cat does not think of stretching, it stretches. But a tree does not even do this. A tree simply sways without the effort of moving itself. That is how she moved.\nI caught up to her as quickly as I could without attracting her attention. \u201cExcuse me, miss?\u201d\nShe turned. Her face brightened at the sight of me. \u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cI would never normally approach a woman in this way, but I couldn\u2019t help but notice that you have the eyes of a lady I was once desperately in love with.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a shame to love only once,\u201d she said, showing her white teeth in a wicked smile. \u201cI\u2019ve heard some men can manage twice or even more.\u201d\nI ignored her gibe. \u201cI am only a fool once. Never will I love again.\u201d\nHer expression turned soft and she laid her hand lightly on my arm. \u201cYou poor man! She must have hurt you terribly.\u201d\n \n\u201c\u2019Struth, she wounded me more ways than one.\u201d\n\u201cBut such things are to be expected,\u201d she said matter-of-factly. \u201cHow could a woman help but love a man so striking as yourself?\u201d\n\u201cI know not,\u201d I said modestly. \u201cBut I think she must not, for she caught me with an easy smile, then stole away without a word. Like dew in dawn\u2019s pale light.\u201d\n\u201cLike a dream upon waking,\u201d Denna added with a smile.\n\u201cLike a faerie maiden slipping through the trees.\u201d\nDenna was silent for a moment. \u201cShe must have been wondrous indeed, to\ncatch you so entire,\u201d she said, looking at me with serious eyes.\n\u201cShe was beyond compare.\u201d\n\u201cOh come now.\u201d Her manner changed to jovial. \u201cWe all know that when\nthe lights are out all women are the same height!\u201d She gave a rough chuckle and ribbed me knowingly with an elbow.\n\u201cNot true,\u201d I said with firm conviction.\n\u201cWell,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to take your word for it.\u201d She looked back up at me. \u201cPerhaps in time you can convince me.\u201d\nI looked into the deep brown of her eyes. \u201cThat has ever been my hope.\u201d\nDenna smiled and my heart stepped sideways in my chest. \u201cMaintain it.\u201d She slid her arm inside the curve of mine and fell into step beside me. \u201cFor without hope what do any of us have?\u201d", "CHAPTER SIXTY-SEVEN\nTelling Faces\nI SPENT A FAIR PORTION of the next two days under Stapes\u2019 tutelage, ensuring I knew the proper etiquette for a formal dinner. I was already familiar with a great deal of it from my early childhood, but I was glad for the review. Customs differ from place to place and year to year, and even small missteps can lead to great embarrassment.\nSo Stapes conducted a dinner for just the two of us, then informed me of a dozen small but important mistakes I had made. Setting down a dirty utensil was considered crude, for example. That meant it was perfectly acceptable to lick one\u2019s knife clean. In fact, if you didn\u2019t want to dirty your napkin it was the only seemly thing to do.\nIt was improper to eat the entirety of a piece of bread. Some portion should always be left on the plate, preferably more than crust. The same was true of milk: the final swallow should always remain in the glass.\nThe next day Stapes staged another dinner and I made more mistakes. Commenting on the food wasn\u2019t rude, but it was rustic. The same was true of smelling the wine. And, apparently, the small soft cheese I\u2019d been served possessed a rind. A rind any civilized person would have recognized as inedible and meant to be pared away.\nBarbarian that I am, I had eaten all of it. It had tasted quite nice too. Still, I took note of this fact and resigned myself to throw away half of a perfectly good cheese if it was set in front of me. Such is the price of civilization.\nI arrived for the banquet wearing a suit of clothes tailored just for the occasion. The colors were good for me, leaf green and black. There was too much brocade for my taste, but tonight I made a grudging bow to fashion as I would be seated to the left of Meluan Lackless.\n \nStapes had staged six formal dinners for me in the last three days, and I felt prepared for anything. When I arrived outside the banquet hall, I expected the hardest part of the evening would be feigning interest in the food.\nBut while I might have been prepared for the meal, I was not prepared for the sight of Meluan Lackless herself. Luckily, my stage training took hold and I moved smoothly through the ritual motion of smiling and offering my arm. She nodded courteously and we made our procession to the table together.\nThere were tall candelabra with dozens of candles. Engraved silver pitchers held hot water for handbowls and cold water for drinking glasses. Old vases with elaborate floral arrangements sweetened the air. Cornucopia overflowed with polished fruit. Personally, I found it gaudy. But it was traditional, a showcase for the wealth of the host.\nI walked the Lady Lackless to the table and held out her chair. I had avoided looking in her direction as we walked the length of the room, but as I helped her into her seat, her profile struck me with such a strong resemblance that I couldn\u2019t help but stare. I knew her, I was certain of it. But I couldn\u2019t for the life of me remember where we might have met. . . .\nAs I took my seat, I tried to guess where I might have seen her before. If the Lackless lands weren\u2019t a thousand miles away, I would have thought I knew her from the University. But that was ridiculous. The Lackless heir wouldn\u2019t study so far from home.\nMy eyes wandered over maddeningly familiar features. Might I have met her at the Eolian? That didn\u2019t seem likely. I would have remembered. She was strikingly lovely, with a strong jaw and dark brown eyes. I\u2019m sure if I\u2019d seen her there . . .\n\u201cDo you see aught that interests you?\u201d she asked without turning to look at me. Her tone was pleasant, but accusation lay not far beneath the surface.\nI had been staring. Hardly a minute at table and I was already putting my elbow in the butter. \u201cI beg your pardon. But I am a keen observer of faces, and yours struck me.\u201d\nMeluan turned to look at me, her irritation fading a bit. \u201cAre you a turagior?\u201d\nTuragiors claimed to be able to tell your personality or future from your face, eyes, and the shape of your head. Pure-blooded Vintic superstition. \u201cI dabble a bit, m\u2019lady.\u201d\n\u201cReally? What does my face tell you then?\u201d She looked up and away from", "me.\nI made a show of looking over Meluan\u2019s features, taking note of her pale\nskin and artfully curled chestnut hair. Her mouth was full and red without the benefit of any paint. The line of her neck was proud and graceful.\nI nodded. \u201cI can see a piece of your future in it, m\u2019lady.\u201d\nOne of her eyebrows went up a bit. \u201cDo tell.\u201d\n\u201cYou will be receiving an apology shortly. Forgive my eyes, they flit like\nthe calanthis, place to place. I could not keep them from your fair flower face.\u201d\nMeluan smiled, but did not blush. Not immune to flattery, but no stranger to it either. I tucked that bit of information away. \u201cThat was a fairly easy fortune to tell,\u201d she said. \u201cSee you anything else?\u201d\nI took another moment to search her face. \u201cTwo other things, m\u2019lady. It tells me you are Meluan Lackless, and that I am at your service.\u201d\nShe smiled and gave me her hand to kiss. I took hold of it and bowed my head over it. I didn\u2019t actually kiss it, as would have been proper back in the Commonwealth, instead I pressed my lips briefly onto my own thumb that held her hand. Actually kissing her hand would have been terribly forward in this part of the world.\nOur banter was stalled by the arrival of the soups, forty servants placing them before forty guests all at once. I tasted mine. Why in God\u2019s name would anyone make a sweet soup?\nI ate another spoonful and pretended to enjoy it. From the corner of my eye, I watched my neighbor, a tiny, older man I knew to be the Viceroy of Bannis. His face and hands were wrinkled and spotted, his hair a disarrayed tousle of grey. I watched him put a finger into his soup without a hint of self- consciousness, taste it, then push the bowl aside.\nHe rummaged in his pockets and opened his hand to show me what he\u2019d found. \u201cI always bring a pocket full of candy almonds to these things,\u201d he said in a conspiratorial whisper, his eyes as cunning as a child\u2019s. \u201cYou never know what they\u2019ll try to feed you.\u201d He held his hand out. \u201cYou can have one if you like.\u201d\nI took one, thanked him, and faded from his awareness for the rest of the evening. When I glanced back several minutes later, he was eating unabashedly from his pocket and bickering with his wife about whether or not the peasantry could make bread from acorns. From the sound of it, I guessed it was a small piece of a larger argument that they had been having", "their entire lives.\nTo Meluan\u2019s right there was a Yllish couple, chatting away in their own\nlilting language. Combined with strategically placed decorations that made it difficult to see the guests on the other side of the table, Meluan and I were more alone than if we had been walking together in the gardens. The Maer had arranged his seating well.\nThe soup was taken away and replaced with a piece of meat I assumed was pheasant covered in a thick cream sauce. I was surprised to find it quite to my taste.\n\u201cSo how do you think we came to be paired?\u201d Meluan asked conversationally. \u201cMister . . .\u201d\n\u201cKvothe.\u201d I made a small seated bow. \u201cIt could be because the Maer wished you to be entertained, and I am at times entertaining.\u201d\n\u201cQuite.\u201d\n\u201cOr it could be I paid the steward an incredible sum of money.\u201d Her smile flickered again as she took a drink of water. Enjoys boldness, I thought to myself.\nI wiped my fingers and almost set the napkin on the table, which would have been a terrible mistake. That was a signal to remove whatever course was currently being served. Done too soon, it implied a silent but scathing criticism of the host\u2019s hospitality. I felt a bead of sweat begin to trickle down my back between my shoulder blades as I deliberately folded the napkin and laid it on my lap.\n\u201cSo how do you occupy yourself, Mr. Kvothe?\u201d\nShe hadn\u2019t asked as to my employment, which meant she assumed I was a member of the nobility. Luckily, I\u2019d already laid the groundwork for this. \u201cI write a bit. Genealogies. A play or two. Do you enjoy the theater?\u201d\n\u201cOccasionally. Depending.\u201d\n\u201cDepending on the play?\u201d\n\u201cDepending on the performers,\u201d she said, an odd tension touching her\nvoice.\nI wouldn\u2019t have noticed it if I hadn\u2019t been watching her so closely. I\ndecided to change the subject to safer ground.\n\u201cHow did you find the roads on your way to Severen?\u201d I asked. Everyone\nloves to complain about the roads. It\u2019s as safe a topic as the weather. \u201cI heard there has been some difficulty with bandits to the north.\u201d I hoped to excite the conversation a little. The more she talked, the better I could get to know her.", "\u201cThe roads are always thick with Ruh bandits this time of year,\u201d Meluan said coldly.\nNot just bandits, Ruh bandits. She said the word with such a weight of cold loathing in her voice that I was chilled to hear it. She hated the Ruh. Not the simple distaste most people feel for us, but a true, sharp hate with teeth in it.\nI was saved from making a response by the arrival of chilled fruit pastries. To my left the viceroy argued acorns to his wife. To my right, Meluan slowly tore a strawberry pastry in half, her face pale as an ivory mask. Watching her flawless polished nails tear the pastry into pieces, I knew her thoughts were dwelling on the Ruh.\nAside from her brief mention of the Edema Ruh, the evening went quite well. I slowly set Meluan at her ease, talking casually of small things. The elaborate dinner lasted two hours, giving us ample time for discussion. I found her to be everything Alveron had suggested: intelligent, attractive, and well-spoken. Even the knowledge that she loathed the Ruh could not entirely keep me from enjoying her company.\nI returned to my room immediately after dinner and began to write. By the time the Maer came to call I had three drafts of a letter, an outline of a song, and five sheets filled with notes and phrases I hoped to use later.\n\u201cCome in, your grace.\u201d I glanced up as he entered. He hardly seemed the same sickly, doddering man I\u2019d nursed back to health. He\u2019d put on some weight and looked five years younger.\n\u201cWhat did you think of her?\u201d Alveron said. \u201cDid she mention any suitors when you spoke?\u201d\n\u201cNo, your grace,\u201d I said, handing him a folded piece of paper. \u201cHere is the first letter you will want to send to her. I trust you can find a way of delivering it to her secretly?\u201d\nHe unfolded it and began to read, his lips moving silently. I labored out another line of song, scratching out the chording alongside the words.\nEventually the Maer looked up. \u201cDon\u2019t you think this is a little much?\u201d he said uncomfortably.\n\u201cNo.\u201d I paused in my writing long enough to gesture with my pen toward a different piece of paper.\u201cThat one is too much. The one in your hand is just\n \nenough. She\u2019s got a streak of romance in her. She wants to be swept from her feet, though she\u2019d probably deny it.\u201d\nThe Maer\u2019s expression was still doubtful so I pushed myself away from the table and set down my quill. \u201cYour grace, you were right. She is a woman well worthy of pursuit. In a handful of days there will be a dozen men in the estates who would gladly take her to wife, am I right?\u201d\n\u201cThere are already a dozen here,\u201d he said grimly. \u201cSoon there will be three dozen.\u201d\n\u201cAdd another dozen she will meet at dinner or walking in the garden. Then another dozen who will court her merely for the chase. Of those dozens, how many will write her letters and poems? They will send her flowers, trinkets, tokens of affection. Soon she will be receiving a deluge of attention. You have one, best hope.\u201d\nI pointed to the letter. \u201cAct quickly. That letter will catch her imagination, her curiosity. In a day or two, when the other notes are cluttering her desk, she will already be awaiting the second one of ours.\u201d\nHe seemed to hesitate a moment, then his shoulders bowed. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cThere are no certainties in this, your grace. Only hopes. That is the best one I can give you.\u201d\nAlveron hesitated. \u201cI know nothing of this,\u201d he said with a hint of petulance. \u201cI wish there were some book of rules a man could follow.\u201d For a moment he looked very much like an ordinary man and very little like the Maer Alveron at all.\nTruthfully, I was more than slightly concerned myself. What I personally knew about courting women could comfortably fit into a thimble without taking it off your finger first.\nOn the other hand, I had a vast wealth of secondary knowledge. Ten thousand romantic songs, plays, and stories taken all together had to be worth something. And on the negative side, I\u2019d seen Simmon pursue nearly every woman within three miles of the University with the doomed enthusiasm of a child trying to fly. What\u2019s more, I had watched a hundred men dash themselves to pieces against Denna like ships attempting to ignore the tide.\nAlveron looked at me, his face still showing honest concern. \u201cWill a month be enough time, do you think?\u201d\nWhen I spoke, I was surprised by the confidence in my own voice. \u201cYour grace, if I cannot help you catch her in the space of a month, then it cannot be", "done.\u201d", "CHAPTER SIXTY-EIGHT\nThe Cost of a Loaf\nTHE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED were pleasant ones. My sunlight hours were spent with Denna in Severen-Low, exploring the city and surrounding countryside. We spent time riding, swimming, singing, or simply talking the afternoons away. I flattered her outrageously and without hope, because only a fool would hope to catch her.\nThen I would return to my rooms and pen the letter that had been building inside me all day. Or I would pour out a torrent of song to her. And in that letter or song I said all the things I hadn\u2019t dared to tell Denna during the day. Things I knew would only frighten her away.\nAfter I finished the letter or the song, I would write it again. I would dull its edges a little, remove an honesty or two. I slowly smoothed and stitched until it fit Meluan Lackless as snugly as a calfskin glove.\nIt was idyllic. I had better luck finding Denna in Severen than I ever had in Imre. We met for hours at a stretch, sometimes more than once a day, sometimes three or four days in a row.\nThough, in the interest of honesty, things were not perfect. There were a few burrs in the blanket, as my father used to say.\nThe first was a young gentleman named Gerred who accompanied Denna on one of our early meetings down in Severen-Low. He didn\u2019t know her as Denna, of course. He called her Alora, and so did I for the rest of the day.\nGerred\u2019s face held the doomed expression I had come to know very well. He had known Denna long enough to fall for her, and he was just beginning to realize his time was drawing to an end.\nI watched as he made the same mistakes I\u2019d seen others make before him. He put his arm around her possessively. He gave her the gift of a ring. As we strolled the city, if her eye focused on anything for more than three seconds he offered to buy it for her. He tried to pin her down with a promise of some future meeting. A dance at the DeFerre\u2019s manse? Dinner at the Golden Board? The Tenpenny King was being performed tomorrow by Count", "Abelard\u2019s men. . . ?\nIndividually, any of these things would have been fine. Perhaps even\ncharming. But taken together they showed themselves as pure, white- knuckled desperation. He clutched at Denna as if he were a drowning man and she a plank of wood.\nHe glared at me when she wasn\u2019t watching, and when Denna bid the two of us good-bye that evening, his face was drawn and white as if he were already two days dead.\nThe second burr was worse. After I\u2019d been helping the Maer court his lady for almost two span, Denna disappeared. No trace or word of warning. No note of farewell or apology. I waited for three hours at the livery where we\u2019d agreed to meet. After that I went to her inn, only to find that she had left with all her things the night before.\nI went to the park where we had taken lunch the previous day, then to a dozen other places where we\u2019d made a habit of each other\u2019s company. It was near midnight by the time I took the lifts back to the top of the Sheer. Even then some foolish part of me hoped she would greet me at the top, rushing into my arms again with her wild enthusiasm.\nBut she wasn\u2019t there. That night I wrote no letter or song for Meluan.\nThe second day I ghosted through Severen-Low for hours, worried and wounded. Later that night in my rooms, I sweat and cursed and crumpled my way through twenty sheets of paper before I arrived at three brief, half- tolerable paragraphs which I gave to the Maer to do with as he wished.\nThe third day my heart sat like a stone in my chest. I tried to finish the song I\u2019d been writing for the Maer, but nothing worthwhile came of my efforts. For the first hour the notes I played were leaden and lifeless. The second hour they grew discordant and faltering. I pressed on until every sound my lute made grated like a knife against teeth.\nI finally let my poor, tortured lute fall silent, remembering something my father had said long ago: \u201cSongs choose their hour and their own season. When your tune\u2019s tin, there is a reason. The tone of a tune is your heart\u2019s mettle, and there\u2019s no clear water from a muddy well. All you can do is let the silt settle, or you\u2019ll sound sour as a broken bell.\u201d\nI lowered my lute into its case, knowing the truth of it. I needed a few days before I could productively return to courting Meluan on the Maer\u2019s behalf. The work was too delicate to force or fake.\nOn the other hand, I knew the Maer would not be pleased with a delay. I", "needed a diversion, and since the Maer was too clever by half, it needed to be at least halfway legitimate.\nI heard the telltale sigh of air that signaled the Maer\u2019s secret passage opening in my dressing room. I made sure I was pacing anxiously by the time he came through the doorway.\nAlveron had continued to put on weight in the last two span, and his face was no longer hollow and drawn. He cut quite a figure in his finery, a creamy ivory shirt and stiff jacket of deep sapphire blue. \u201cI got your message,\u201d he said brusquely. \u201cHave you finished the song then?\u201d\nI turned to face him. \u201cNo, your grace. Something more important than the song has come to my attention.\u201d\n\u201cAs far as you are concerned, there is nothing more important than the song,\u201d the Maer said firmly, tugging the cuff of his shirt to straighten it. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from several people that Meluan was greatly pleased with the first two. You should focus the whole of your efforts in that direction.\u201d\n\u201cYour grace, I am well aware that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOut with it,\u201d Alveron said impatiently, glancing at the face of the tall gear-clock that stood in the corner of the room. \u201cI have appointments to keep.\u201d\n\u201cYour life is in further danger from Caudicus.\u201d\nI\u2019ll give this to the Maer, he could have made his living on the stage. The only break in his composure was a brief hesitation as he tugged his other cuff into place. \u201cAnd how is that?\u201d he asked, apparently unconcerned.\n\u201cThere are ways for him to harm you other than poison. Things that can be done from a distance.\u201d\n\u201cA spell, you mean,\u201d Alveron said. \u201cHe means to conjure up a sending and set it to bedevil me?\u201d\nTehlu anyway, spells and sendings. It was easy to forget this intelligent, subtle, and otherwise educated man was little better than a child when it came to arcane matters. He probably believed in faeries and the walking dead. Poor fool.\nHowever, attempting to reeducate him would be tiresome and counterproductive. \u201cThere is a chance of that, your grace. As well as other,\n \nmore direct threats.\u201d\nHe dropped some of his unconcerned pose and looked me in the eye.\n\u201cWhat could be more direct than a sending?\u201d\nThe Maer was not the sort of man to be moved through words alone, so I\npicked up an apple from a bowl of fruit and polished it on my sleeve before handing it to him. \u201cWould you hold this for a moment, your grace?\u201d\nHe took it, suspiciously. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about then?\u201d\nI walked over to where my lovely burgundy cloak hung on the wall, and retrieved a needle from one of its many pockets. \u201cI\u2019m showing you the sort of thing Caudicus is capable of, your grace.\u201d I held out my hand for the apple.\nHe gave it back and I looked it over. Holding it at an angle to the light, I saw what I\u2019d hoped for, smudged onto the glossy skin of the apple. I muttered a binding, focused my Alar, and pushed the needle into the center of the blurry imprint his forefinger had made on the apple\u2019s skin.\nAlveron twitched and made an inarticulate noise of surprise, staring at his hand as if it had been unexpectedly, say, pricked with a pin.\nI\u2019d half-expected him to rebuke me, but he did nothing of the sort. His eyes went wide, his face pale. Then his expression grew thoughtful as he watched the bead of blood swell on the pad of his finger.\nHe licked his lips and slowly put his finger into his mouth. \u201cI see,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cSuch things can be guarded against?\u201d It wasn\u2019t really a question.\nI nodded, keeping my expression grave. \u201cSomewhat, your grace. I believe I can create a . . . a charm to protect you. I only regret I didn\u2019t think of this sooner, but with one thing and another\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes.\u201d The Maer waved me into silence. \u201cAnd what will you require for such a charm?\u201d\nIt was a layered question. On the surface he was asking what materials I would need. But the Maer was a practical man. He was asking me my price as well.\n\u201cThe workshop in Caudicus\u2019 tower should have the equipment I need, your grace. What materials he doesn\u2019t have on hand, I should be able to find in Severen, given time.\u201d\nThen I paused, considering the second portion of his question, thinking of the hundred things the Maer could grant me: money enough to swim in, a newly crafted lute of the sort only kings could afford. I felt a shock run through me at the thought. An Antressor lute. I\u2019d never even seen one, but my father had. He\u2019d played one once in Anilin, and sometimes when he\u2019d", "had a cup of wine he would talk about it, his hands making gentle shapes in the air.\nThe Maer could arrange this sort of thing in the blink of an eye.\nAll that and more, of course. Alveron could arrange access to a hundred private libraries. A formal patronage would be no small thing either, coming from him. The Maer\u2019s name would open doors as quickly as the king\u2019s.\n\u201cThere are a few things,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cThat I have been hoping to discuss with your grace. I have a project I need assistance to pursue properly. And I have a friend, a talented musician, who could use a well-placed patron. . . .\u201d I trailed off meaningfully.\nAlveron nodded, his grey eyes showing he understood. The Maer was no fool. He knew the cost of a loaf. \u201cI\u2019ll have Stapes get you the keys to Caudicus\u2019 tower,\u201d he said. \u201cHow long will this charm take to produce?\u201d\nI paused as if considering. \u201cAt least four days, your grace.\u201d That would give me time for the muddy waters of my creative well to clear. Or time for Denna to return from whatever errand had pulled her suddenly away. \u201cIf I was sure of his equipment, it could be sooner, but I will have to move carefully. I don\u2019t know what Caudicus might have done to foul things before he fled.\u201d\nAlveron frowned at this. \u201cWill you be able to continue your current projects as well?\u201d\n\u201cNo your grace. It will be rather exhausting and time-consuming. Especially since I\u2019m assuming you\u2019d prefer I be circumspect while gathering my materials in Severen-Low?\u201d\n\u201cYes of course.\u201d He exhaled hard through his nose. \u201cDamn and bother, things were going so well. Who can I bring in to write letters while you\u2019re occupied?\u201d He said the last musingly, mostly to himself.\nI needed to nip that thought in the bud. I did not want to share credit for Meluan\u2019s courtship with anyone. \u201cI don\u2019t think that will be necessary, your grace. Seven or eight days ago, perhaps. But now, as you say, we have her interest. She is excited, eager for the next contact. If a few days pass with nothing from us, she will be disappointed. But more importantly, she will be anxious for the return of your attention.\u201d\nThe Maer smoothed his beard with one hand, his expression pensive. I considered making a comparison to playing a fish on a line, but I doubted the Maer had ever engaged in anything so rustic as fishing. \u201cNot to presume, your grace. But in your younger days, did you ever attempt to win the", "affection of a young lady?\u201d\nAlveron smiled at my careful phrasing. \u201cYou may presume.\u201d\n\u201cWhich did you find more interesting? The ones who leapt to your arms\nstraightaway, or those who were more difficult, reluctant, even indifferent to your pursuit?\u201d The Maer\u2019s eyes were far away with remembering. \u201cThe same is true of women. Some cannot bear it when a man clings to them. And they all appreciate space to make their own choices. It\u2019s hard to long for something that is always there.\u201d\nAlveron nodded. \u201cThere is some truth in that. Absence feeds affection.\u201d He nodded more firmly. \u201cVery well. Three days.\u201d He glanced at the gear clock again. \u201cAnd now I must be\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOne final thing, your grace,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cThe charm I will make must be tuned specifically to you. It will require some of your cooperation.\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cMore precisely, some of your . . .\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cSubstance.\u201d\n\u201cSpeak plainly.\u201d\n\u201cA small amount of blood, saliva, skin, hair, and urine.\u201d I sighed internally, knowing that to someone of the superstitious Vintic mind-set, this would sound like a recipe for a sending or some other equally ridiculous thing.\nAs I\u2019d expected, the Maer\u2019s eyes narrowed at the list. \u201cWhile I am no expert,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cthose seem to be the very things I should avoid parting with. How can I trust you?\u201d\nI could have protested my loyalty, pointed out my past service, or brought to his attention that I\u2019d already saved his life. But over the last month I\u2019d come to know how the Maer\u2019s mind worked.\nI gave him my best knowing smile. \u201cYou are an intelligent man, your grace. I\u2019m sure you know the answer without my telling you.\u201d\nHe returned my smile. \u201cHumor me, then.\u201d\nI shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re of no use to me if you\u2019re dead, your grace.\u201d\nHis grey eyes searched mine for a moment, then nodded, satisfied. \u201cVery\ntrue. Send a message when you need those things.\u201d He turned to leave. \u201cThree days.\u201d", "CHAPTER SIXTY-NINE\nSuch Madness\nIMADE SEVERAL TRIPS TO Severen-Low to gather materials for Alveron\u2019s gram. Raw gold. Nickel and iron. Coal and etching acids. I acquired the money for these purchases by selling off various pieces of equipment from Caudicus\u2019 workshop. I could have asked the Maer for money, but I\u2019d rather he thought of me as independently resourceful rather than an ongoing financial drain.\nQuite by coincidence, in the course of this buying and selling, I visited many of the places Denna and I had spent time together.\nI\u2019d grown so accustomed to finding her that now I caught glimpses of her when she wasn\u2019t there. Every day my hopeful heart rose at the sight of her turning a corner, stepping into a cobbler\u2019s, raising her hand to wave from across a courtyard. But it was never truly her, and I returned to the Maer\u2019s estate each evening more desolate than the day before.\nMaking things worse was the fact that Bredon had left Severen several days ago to visit some nearby relatives. I didn\u2019t realize how much I\u2019d come to depend on him until he was gone.\nAs I\u2019ve already said, a gram is not particularly difficult to make if you have the proper equipment, a schema, and an Alar like a blade of Ramston steel. The metalworking tools in Caudicus\u2019 tower were serviceable, though nowhere near as nice as those in the Fishery. The schema was no difficulty either, as I have a good memory for such things.\nWhile I was working on the Maer\u2019s gram, I started a second one to replace the one I\u2019d lost. Unfortunately, given the relatively crude nature of the equipment I was working with, I didn\u2019t have time to finish it properly.\nI finished the Maer\u2019s gram three days after talking to the Maer, six days after Denna\u2019s sudden disappearance. The following day I abandoned my pointless searching and planted myself in one of the open air-caf\u00e9s where I drank coffee and tried to find inspiration for the song I owed the Maer. Ten hours I spent there, and the only act of creation I accomplished was to", "magically transform nearly a gallon of coffee into marvelous, aromatic piss. That night I drank an unwise amount of scutten and fell asleep at my\nwriting desk. Meluan\u2019s song was still unfinished. The Maer was less than pleased.\nDenna reappeared on the seventh day as I wandered our haunts in Severen- Low. Despite all my searching, she saw me first and ran laughing to my side, excited to tell me about a song she\u2019d heard the day before. We spent the day together as easily as if she\u2019d never left.\nI didn\u2019t ask her about her unexplained disappearance. I\u2019d known Denna for more than a year now, and I understood a few of the hidden turnings of her heart. I knew she valued her privacy. I knew she had secrets.\nThat night, we were in a small garden that ran along the very edge of the Sheer. We sat on a wooden bench looking out over the dark city below: a messy splay of lamplight, streetlight, gaslight, with a few rare sharp points of sympathy light scattered throughout.\n\u201cI am sorry, you know,\u201d she said softly.\nWe\u2019d been sitting, quietly watching the lights of the city for nearly a quarter hour. If she was continuing some previous conversation, I couldn\u2019t remember what it was. \u201cBeg pardon?\u201d\nWhen Denna didn\u2019t say anything immediately, I turned to look at her. There was no moon, and the night was dark. Her face was dimly illuminated by the thousand lights below.\n\u201cSometimes I leave,\u201d she said at last. \u201cQuick and quiet in the night.\u201d\nDenna didn\u2019t look at me as she spoke, keeping her dark eyes fixed on the city below. \u201cIt\u2019s what I do,\u201d she continued, her voice quiet. \u201cI leave. No word or warning first. No explanation after. Sometimes it\u2019s the only thing that I can do.\u201d\nShe turned to meet my eyes then, her face serious in the dim light. \u201cI hope you know without my telling you,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope I don\u2019t need to say it. . . .\u201d\nDenna turned back to look at the glimmering lights below. \u201cBut for what it\u2019s worth, I am sorry.\u201d\nWe sat for a while then, enjoying a comfortable silence. I wanted to say\n \nsomething. I wanted to say it didn\u2019t bother me, but that would be a lie. I wanted to tell her all that really mattered to me was that she came back, but I was worried that might be too much truth.\nSo rather that risk saying the wrong thing, I said nothing. I knew what happened to the men who clung to her too tightly. That was the difference between me and the others. I did not clutch at her, try to own her. I did not slip my arm around her, murmur in her ear, or kiss her unsuspecting cheek.\nCertainly, I thought of it. I still remembered the warmth of her when she had thrown her arms around me near the horse lift. There were times I would have given my right hand to hold her again.\nBut then I thought of the faces of the other men when they realized Denna was leaving them. I thought of all the others who had tried to tie her to the ground and failed. So I resisted showing her the songs and poems I had written, knowing that too much truth can ruin a thing.\nAnd if that meant she wasn\u2019t entirely mine, what of it? I would be the one she could always return to without fear of recrimination or question. So I did not try to win her and contented myself with playing a beautiful game.\nBut there was always a part of me that hoped for more, and so there was a part of me that was always a fool.\nDays passed, and Denna and I explored the streets of Severen. We lounged in caf\u00e9s, attended plays, went riding. We climbed the face of the Sheer using the low road just to say we\u2019d done it. We visited the dock markets, a traveling menagerie, and several curiosity cabinets.\nSome days we did nothing but sit and talk, and on those days, nothing filled our conversations as much as music.\nWe spent countless hours discussing the craft of it. How songs fit together. How chorus and verse play against each other, about tone and mode and meter.\nThese were things I\u2019d learned at an early age and thought about often. And though Denna was new to this study, in some ways that worked to her advantage. I\u2019d learned about music since before I could talk. I knew ten thousand rules of melody and verse better than I knew the backs of my own hands.\n \nDenna didn\u2019t. In some ways this hampered her, but in other ways it made her music strange and marvelous. . . .\nI\u2019m doing a poor job of explaining this. Think of music as being a great snarl of a city like Tarbean. In the years I spent living there, I came to know its streets. Not just the main streets. Not just the alleys. I knew shortcuts and rooftops and parts of the sewers. Because of this, I could move through the city like a rabbit in a bramble. I was quick and cunning and clever.\nDenna, on the other hand, had never been trained. She knew nothing of shortcuts. You\u2019d think she\u2019d be forced to wander the city, lost and helpless, trapped in a twisting maze of mortared stone.\nBut instead, she simply walked through the walls. She didn\u2019t know any better. Nobody had ever told her she couldn\u2019t. Because of this, she moved through the city like some faerie creature. She walked roads no one else could see, and it made her music wild and strange and free.\nIn the end it took twenty-three letters, six songs, and, though it shames me to say it, one poem.\nThere was more to it than that, of course. Letters alone cannot win a woman\u2019s heart. Alveron did a fair piece of his own courting. And after he revealed himself as Meluan\u2019s anonymous suitor, he did the lion\u2019s share of the work, slowly wooing Meluan to his side with the gentle reverence he felt for her.\nBut my letters caught her attention. My songs brought her close enough for Alveron to work his slow, garrulous charm.\nEven so, I can take only a small piece of credit for the letters and songs. And as for the poem, there is only one thing in the world that could move me to such madness.\n \nCHAPTER SEVENTY\nClinging\nI MET DENNA OUTSIDE HER inn on Chalker\u2019s Lane, a little place called the Four Tapers. As I turned the corner and saw her standing in the light cast by a lantern hanging above the front door, I felt an upwelling of joy at the simple pleasure of being able to find her when I went looking.\n\u201cI got your note,\u201d I said. \u201cImagine my delight.\u201d\nDenna smiled and made a one-handed curtsey. She was wearing a skirt, not a complicated dress of the sort a noblewoman would wear, but a simple sweep of fabric you could wear while bucking hay or going to a barn dance. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you would be able to make it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt being past the hour most civilized folk have taken to their beds.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll admit I was surprised,\u201d I said. \u201cIf I was the sort of man to pry, I would wonder what kept you occupied until this most unseemly hour.\u201d\n\u201cBusiness,\u201d she said with a dramatic sigh. \u201cA meeting with my patron.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s in town again?\u201d I asked.\nShe nodded.\n\u201cAnd he wanted to meet you at midnight?\u201d I asked. \u201cThat\u2019s . . . odd.\u201d Denna stepped out from under the inn\u2019s sign and we began to walk down\nthe street together. \u201cThe hand that holds the purse . . .\u201d she said, giving a helpless shrug. \u201cOdd times and inconvenient places are the rule with Master Ash. Some part of me suspects he might simply be some lonely noble, bored with ordinary patronage. I wonder if it adds some spice for him, pretending he\u2019s meshed in some dark intrigue instead of just commissioning some songs from me.\u201d\n\u201cSo what do you have planned for tonight?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cOnly to pass time in your lovely company,\u201d Denna said, reaching out and linking her arm with mine.\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d I said, \u201cI have something to show you. It\u2019s a surprise. You\u2019ll have to trust me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard each of those a dozen times.\u201d Denna\u2019s dark eyes glittered", "wickedly. \u201cBut never all together, and never from you.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll give you the benefit of the doubt and save my world-weary gibes for later. Take me where you will.\u201d\nSo we made our way to Severen-High by way of the horse lifts, where we both gawked at the lights of the nighttime city below like the lowborn cretins we were. I took her on a long stroll through cobblestone streets, past shops and small gardens. Then we left the buildings behind, climbed over a low wooden fence, and moved toward the dark shape of an empty barn.\nAt this, Denna was no longer able to keep quiet. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve done it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve surprised me.\u201d\nI grinned at her and continued to lead the way into the dark of the barn. It was full of the smell of hay and absent animals. I led her to a ladder that disappeared into the dark above our heads.\n\u201cA hayloft?\u201d she demanded, her voice incredulous. She stopped walking and gave me an odd, curious look. \u201cYou obviously have me mistaken for a fourteen-year-old farm girl named . . .\u201d Her mouth worked soundlessly for a moment. \u201cSomething rustic.\u201d\n\u201cGretta,\u201d I suggested.\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cYou obviously have me mistaken for a low-bodiced farm girl named Gretta.\u201d\n\u201cRest assured,\u201d I said. \u201cIf I were going to try to seduce you, this isn\u2019t the way I would go about it.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d she said, running her hand through her hair. Her fingers began to idly twine her hair into a braid, then she stopped and brushed it out. \u201cIn that case, what are we doing here?\u201d\n\u201cYou mentioned how much you enjoyed gardens,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd Alveron\u2019s gardens are particularly fine. I thought you might enjoy a turn about the place.\u201d\n\u201cIn the middle of the night,\u201d Denna said.\n\u201cA charming moonlit stroll,\u201d I corrected.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no moon tonight,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cOr if there is, it\u2019s barely a\nslender sliver.\u201d\n\u201cBe that as it may,\u201d I said, refusing to be daunted. \u201cHow much moonlight\ndoes one actually need to enjoy the smell of gently blooming jasmine?\u201d \u201cIn the hayloft,\u201d Denna said, her voice thick with disbelief.\n\u201cThe hayloft is the easiest way onto the roof,\u201d I said. \u201cThence into the\nMaer\u2019s estates. Thence to the garden.\u201d", "\u201cIf you\u2019re in the Maer\u2019s employ,\u201d she said, \u201cwhy not simply ask him to let you in?\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d I said dramatically, holding up a finger. \u201cTherein lies the adventure. There are a hundred men who could simply take you strolling in the Maer\u2019s the gardens. But there is only one who can sneak you in.\u201d I smiled at her. \u201cWhat I\u2019m offering you, Denna, is a singular opportunity.\u201d\nShe grinned at me. \u201cYou know my secret heart so well.\u201d\nI extended my hand as if I were about to assist her into a carriage. \u201cM\u2019lady.\u201d\nDenna took my hand, then stopped as soon as she put her foot onto the first rung of the ladder. \u201cHold on, you aren\u2019t being genteel. You\u2019re trying to get a look up my dress.\u201d\nI gave her my best offended look, pressing my hand to my chest. \u201cLady, as a gentleman I assure you\u2014\u201d\nShe swatted at me. \u201cYou\u2019ve already told me you\u2019re not a gentleman,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re a thief, and you\u2019re trying to steal a look.\u201d She stepped back and made a parody of my courtly gesture of a moment before. \u201cM\u2019lord . . .\u201d\nWe made our way through the hayloft, onto the roof, and into the garden. The sharp sliver of moon above us was thin as a whisper, so pale that it did nothing to dim the light of the stars.\nThe gardens were surprisingly quiet for such a warm and lovely night. Ordinarily even at this late hour couples would be strolling the paths, or murmuring to each other on the bower benches. I wondered if some ball or courtly function had pulled them all away.\nThe Maer\u2019s gardens were vast, with curving paths and cunningly placed hedges making them seem larger still. Denna and I walked side by side, listening to the sigh of the wind through the leaves. It was like we were the only people in the world.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you remember,\u201d I said softly, not wanting to intrude upon the silence. \u201cA conversation we had some time ago. We talked of flowers.\u201d\n\u201cI remember,\u201d she said just as softly.\n\u201cYou said you thought all men had got their lessons in courting from the same worn book.\u201d\nDenna laughed quietly, more a motion than a sound. She put her hand to her mouth. \u201cOh. I\u2019d forgotten. I did say that, didn\u2019t I? \u201d\nI nodded. \u201cYou said they all brought you roses.\u201d\n\u201cThey still do,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish they would find a new book.\u201d", "\u201cYou made me pick a flower that would suit you better,\u201d I said.\nShe smiled up at me shyly. \u201cI remember, I was testing you.\u201d Then she frowned. \u201cBut you got the better of me by picking one I\u2019d never heard of, let alone seen.\u201d\nWe turned a corner and the path led toward the dark green tunnel of an arching bower. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen them yet,\u201d I said. \u201cBut here is your selas flower.\u201d\nThere were only stars lighting our way. The moon so slender it was almost no moon at all. Under the trellis it was dark as Denna\u2019s hair.\nOur eyes were wide and stretching to the dark, and where the starlight slanted through the leaves, they showed hundreds of selas blossoms yawning open in the night. If the scent of selas were not so delicate, it would have been overpowering.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Denna sighed, looking around with wide eyes. Under the bower, her skin was brighter than the moon. She reached out her hands to both sides. \u201cThey\u2019re so soft!\u201d\nWe walked in silence. All around us selas vines wove themselves around the trellis, clinging to the wood and wire, hiding their faces from the nighttime sky. When eventually we came out the other side, it seemed as bright as daylight.\nThe silence stretched until I started to grow uncomfortable. \u201cSo now you know your flower,\u201d I said. \u201cIt seemed a shame you\u2019d never seen one. They\u2019re rather difficult to cultivate, from what I\u2019ve heard.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps they do suit me then,\u201d Denna said softly, looking down. \u201cI don\u2019t take root easily.\u201d\nWe continued walking until the path turned and hid the bower behind us. \u201cYou treat me better than I deserve,\u201d Denna said at last.\nI laughed at the ridiculousness of that. Only respect for the silence of the\ngarden kept it from rolling out of me in a great booming laugh. Instead I stifled it as much as possible, though the effort threw me off my stride and made me stumble.\nDenna watched me from a step away, a smile spreading across her mouth.\nEventually I caught my breath. \u201cYou who sang with me the night I won my pipes. You who have given me the finest gift I ever did receive.\u201d A thought occurred to me. \u201cDid you know,\u201d I said, \u201cthat your lute case saved my life?\u201d\nThe smile spread and grew, wide as a flower. \u201cDid it now?\u201d\n\u201cIt did,\u201d I said. \u201cI cannot ever hope to treat you as well as you deserve.", "Given what I owe you, this is but the smallest payment.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I think it is a lovely start.\u201d She looked up at the sky and drew a\nlong, deep breath. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked moonless nights best. It\u2019s easier to say things in the dark. It\u2019s easier to be yourself.\u201d\nShe began walking again and I fell into step beside her. We passed a fountain, a pool, a wall of pale jasmine open to the night. We crossed a small stone bridge that led us back among the shelter of the hedges.\n\u201cYou could put your arm around me, you know,\u201d she said matter-of-factly. \u201cWe are walking in the gardens, alone. In the moonlight, such as it is.\u201d Denna looked sideways at me, the side of her mouth quirking upward. \u201cSuch things are permitted, you realize.\u201d\nHer sudden change in manner caught me off my guard. Since we had met in Severen I had courted her with wild, hopeless pageantry, and she had matched me without missing a beat. Each flattery, each witticism, each piece of playful banter she returned to me, not in an echo but a harmony. Our back- and-forth had been like a duet.\nBut this was different. Her tone was less playful and more plain. It was so sudden a change that I was at a loss for words.\n\u201cFour days ago I turned my foot on that loose flagstone,\u201d she said softly. \u201cRemember? We were walking on Mincet Lane. My foot slipped and you caught me almost before I knew that I was stumbling. It made me wonder how closely you must be watching me to see something like that.\u201d\nWe turned a corner in the path, and Denna continued to speak without looking up at me. Her voice was soft and musing, almost as if she were talking to herself. \u201cYou had your hands on me then, sure as anything, steadying me. You almost had your arm around me. It would have been so easy for you then. A matter of inches. But when I got my feet beneath me, you took your hands away. No hesitation. No lingering. Nothing I might take amiss.\u201d\nShe started to turn her face to me, then stopped and looked down again. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a thing,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are so many men, all endlessly attempting to sweep me off my feet. And there is one of you, trying just the opposite. Making sure my feet are firm beneath me, lest I fall.\u201d\nAlmost shyly, she reached out. \u201cWhen I move to take your arm, you accept it easily. You even lay your hand on mine, as if to keep it there.\u201d She explained my movement exactly as I was making it, and I fought to keep the gesture from becoming suddenly awkward. \u201cBut that\u2019s all. You never", "presume. You never push. Do you know how strange that is to me?\u201d We looked at each other for a moment, there, in the silent moonlight\ngarden. I could feel the heat of her standing close to me, her hand clinging to my arm.\nInexperienced as I was with women, even I could read this cue. I tried to think of what to say, but I could only wonder at her lips. How could they be so red as this? Even the selas was dark in the faint moonlight. How were her lips so red?\nThen Denna froze. Not that we were moving much, but in a moment she went from motionless to still, cocking her head like a deer straining to catch a half-heard sound. \u201cSomeone\u2019s coming,\u201d she said. \u201cCome on.\u201d Clinging to my arm, she pulled me off the path, over a stone bench, and through a low, narrow gap in the hedges.\nWe finally came to rest in the center of some thick bushes. There was a convenient hollow where we both had room to crouch. Thanks to the work of the gardeners there was no undergrowth to speak of, no dry leaves or twigs to crackle or snap under our hands and knees. In fact, the grass in this sheltered place was thick and soft as any lawn.\n\u201cThere are a thousand girls who could walk with you along the moonlit garden paths,\u201d Denna said breathlessly. \u201cBut there\u2019s only one who\u2019ll hide in the shrubbery with you.\u201d She grinned at me, her voice bubbling with amusement.\nDenna peered out of the hedge toward the path, and I looked at her. Her hair fell like a curtain down the side of her head, and the tip of her ear was peeking out through it. It was, at that moment, the most lovely thing that I had ever seen.\nThen I heard the faint grit of footsteps on the path. The soft sound of voices came sifting through the hedge, a man and a woman. After a moment they came walking around the corner, arm in arm. I recognized them immediately.\nI turned and leaned close, breathing softly into Denna\u2019s ear. \u201cThat\u2019s the Maer,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd his young ladylove.\u201d\nDenna shivered, and I shrugged out of my burgundy cloak, draping it over her shoulders.\nI peered back out at the two of them. As I watched, Meluan laughed at something he said and rested her hand atop his on her arm. I doubted he\u2019d have much more need of my services if they were already on such familiar", "terms as that.\n\u201cNot for you, my dear,\u201d I heard the Maer say clearly as they passed near\nus. \u201cYou shall have nothing but roses.\u201d\nDenna turned to look at me, her eyes wide. She pressed both her hands\nagainst her mouth to stifle her laugher.\nIn another moment they were past us, strolling slowly along, walking in\nstep. Denna removed her hands and took several deep, shuddering breaths. \u201cHe has a copy of the same worn book,\u201d she said, her eyes dancing.\nI couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cApparently.\u201d\n\u201cSo that\u2019s the Maer,\u201d she said quietly, her dark eyes peering between the leaves. \u201cHe\u2019s shorter than I imagined.\u201d\n\u201cWould you like to meet him?\u201d I asked. \u201cI could introduce you.\u201d\n\u201cOh that would be lovely,\u201d she said with a gentle edge of mockery. She chuckled, but when I didn\u2019t join her laughter, she looked up at me and stopped. \u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d She cocked her head to one side, her expression trapped between amusement and confusion.\n\u201cWe probably shouldn\u2019t burst out of the hedge at him,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut we could come out on the other side and loop around to meet him.\u201d I gestured with my hand at the route we could take. \u201cI\u2019m not saying he\u2019ll invite us to dinner or anything. But we can make a polite nod as we pass him on the path.\u201d\nDenna continued to stare at me, her eyebrows furrowing in the faint beginning of a frown. \u201cYou\u2019re serious,\u201d she repeated.\n\u201cWhat do you . . .\u201d I stopped as I realized what her expression meant. \u201cYou thought I was lying about working for the Maer,\u201d I said. \u201cYou thought I was lying about being able to invite you in here.\u201d\n\u201cMen tell stories,\u201d she said dismissively. \u201cThey like to brag a bit. I didn\u2019t think any less of you for telling me a bit of a tall tale.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t lie to you,\u201d I said, then reconsidered. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not the truth. I would. You\u2019re worth lying for. But I wasn\u2019t. You\u2019re worth telling the truth for too.\u201d\nDenna gave me fond smile. \u201cThat\u2019s harder to come by anyway.\u201d\n\u201cSo would you like to?\u201d I asked. \u201cMeet him, I mean?\u201d\nShe looked out of the hedge toward the path. \u201cNo.\u201d When she shook her\nhead her hair moved like drifting shadows. \u201cI believe you. There\u2019s no need.\u201d She looked down. \u201cBesides, I\u2019ve got grass stains on my dress. What would he think?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve got leaves in my hair,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI know exactly what he would think.\u201d\nWe stepped out from the hedge. I picked the leaves out of my hair and Denna brushed her hands down the front of her skirt, wincing a bit as she moved over the grass stains.\nWe made our way back onto the path and started walking again. I thought of putting my arm around her, but didn\u2019t. I was no good judge of these things, but it seemed the moment had passed.\nDenna looked up as we passed a statue of a woman picking a flower. She sighed. \u201cIt was more exciting when I didn\u2019t know I had permission,\u201d she admitted with a little regret in her voice.\n\u201cIt always is,\u201d I agreed.", "CHAPTER SEVENTY-ONE\nInterlude\u2014The Thrice-locked Chest\nKVOTHE RAISED HIS HAND, motioning Chronicler to stop. The scribe wiped the nib of his pen on a nearby cloth and rolled his shoulder stiffly. Wordlessly, Kvothe brought out a worn deck of cards and began to deal them around the table. Bast picked up his cards and looked them over curiously.\nChronicler frowned. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d\nFootsteps sounded on the wooden landing outside, and the door to the Waystone Inn opened, revealing a bald, thick-bodied man wearing an embroidered jacket.\n\u201cMayor Lant!\u201d the innkeeper said, putting down his cards and getting to his feet. \u201cWhat can I do for you? A drink? A bite to eat?\u201d\n\u201cA glass of wine would be quite welcome,\u201d the mayor said as he moved into the room. \u201cDo you have any red Gremsby in?\u201d\nThe innkeeper shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid not,\u201d he said. \u201cThe roads, you know. It\u2019s hard to keep things in stock.\u201d\nThe mayor nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll take anything red then,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I won\u2019t pay more than a penny for it, mind you.\u201d\n\u201cOf course not, sir,\u201d the innkeeper said solicitously, wringing his hands a bit. \u201cAnything to eat?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d the bald man said. \u201cI\u2019m actually here to make use of the scribe. I thought I\u2019d wait until things quieted down a bit, so we could have some privacy.\u201d He looked around the empty room. \u201cI don\u2019t imagine you\u2019d mind my borrowing the place for half an hour, would you?\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d The innkeeper smiled ingratiatingly. He made a shooing motion to Bast.\n\u201cBut I had a full board!\u201d Bast protested, waving his cards.\nThe innkeeper frowned at his assistant, then headed back into the kitchen. The mayor removed his jacket and laid it across the back of a chair while\nBast gathered up the rest of the cards, grumbling.\nThe innkeeper brought out a glass of red wine, then locked the front door", "with a large brass key. \u201cI\u2019ll take the boy upstairs with me,\u201d he said to the mayor, \u201cto give you some privacy.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s exceedingly kind of you,\u201d the mayor said as he sat across from Chronicler. \u201cI\u2019ll give a shout when I\u2019m finished.\u201d\nThe innkeeper nodded and herded Bast out of the common room and up the stairs. Kvothe opened the door to his room and gestured Bast inside.\n\u201cI wonder what old Lant wants to keep secret,\u201d Kvothe said as soon as the door was closed behind them. \u201cI hope he\u2019s not too long about it.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s got two children by the Widow Creel,\u201d Bast said matter-of-factly. Kvothe raised an eyebrow at that. \u201cReally?\u201d\nBast shrugged. \u201cEveryone in town knows.\u201d\nKvothe humphed at this as he settled down into a large upholstered chair.\n\u201cWhat are we going to do with ourselves for half an hour?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been ages since we\u2019ve had lessons.\u201d Bast pulled a wooden chair away\nfrom the small desk and sat on the edge of it. \u201cYou could teach me something.\u201d\n\u201cLessons,\u201d Kvothe mused. \u201cYou could read Celum Tinture.\u201d\n\u201cReshi,\u201d Bast said imploringly. \u201cIt\u2019s so boring. I don\u2019t mind lessons, but do they need to be book lessons?\u201d\nBast\u2019s tone wrung a smile from Kvothe. \u201cA puzzle lesson then?\u201d Bast\u2019s face broke into a grin. \u201cVery well, let me think for a second.\u201d He tapped his fingers against his lips and let his eyes wander the room. It wasn\u2019t long before they were drawn to the foot of the bed where the dark chest lay.\nHe made a casual gesture. \u201cHow would you open my chest if you had a mind to?\u201d\nBast\u2019s expression grew slightly apprehensive. \u201cYour thrice-locked chest, Reshi?\u201d\nKvothe looked at his student, then laughter bubbled up out of him. \u201cMy what?\u201d he asked incredulously.\nBast blushed and looked down. \u201cThat\u2019s just how I think of it,\u201d he mumbled.\n\u201cAs names go . . .\u201d Kvothe hesitated, a smile playing around his mouth. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a little storybook, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who made the thing, Reshi,\u201d Bast said sullenly. \u201cThree locks and fancy wood and all that. It\u2019s not my fault if it sounds storybook.\u201d\nKvothe leaned forward and rested an apologetic hand on Bast\u2019s knee. \u201cIt\u2019s a fine name, Bast. Just caught me off my guard is all.\u201d He leaned back again.", "\u201cSo. How would you attempt to plunder the thrice-locked chest of Kvothe the Bloodless?\u201d\nBast smiled. \u201cYou sound like a pirate when you say it that way, Reshi.\u201d He gave the chest a speculative look from across the room. \u201cI suppose asking you for the keys is out of the question?\u201d he asked at last.\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cFor our purposes, assume I have lost the keys. Better yet, assume I am dead, and you are now free to pry into all my secret things.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a little grim, Reshi,\u201d Bast reproached gently.\n\u201cLife is a little grim, Bast,\u201d Kvothe said without any hint of laughter in his voice. \u201cYou\u2019d best start getting used to it.\u201d He waved a hand toward the chest. \u201cGo on, I\u2019m curious to see how you go about cracking this little chestnut.\u201d\nBast gave him a flat look. \u201cPuns are worse than book lessons, Reshi,\u201d he said, walking over to the chest. He nudged it idly with his foot, then bent and looked at the two separate lock plates, one dark iron, the other bright copper. Bast prodded the rounded lid with a finger, wrinkling his nose. \u201cI can\u2019t say as I care for this wood, Reshi. And the iron lock is positively unfair.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a useful lesson this has already been,\u201d Kvothe said dryly. \u201cYou\u2019ve deduced a universal truth: things are usually unfair.\u201d\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t any hinges, either!\u201d Bast exclaimed, looking at the back of the chest. \u201cHow can you have a lid without any hinges?\u201d\n\u201cThat did take me a while to work out,\u201d Kvothe admitted with a touch of pride.\nBast got down on his hands and knees and looked into the copper keyhole. He lifted one hand and pressed it flat against the copper plate. Then he closed his eyes and went very still, as if he were listening.\nAfter a moment of this, he leaned forward and breathed against the lock. When nothing happened, his mouth began to move. While his words were spoken too softly to hear, they carried an undeniable tone of entreaty.\nAfter a long moment of this, Bast sat back on his haunches, frowning. Then he grinned playfully, reached out with a hand, and knocked on the lid of the chest. It made barely any noise at all, as if he were rapping his knuckle against a stone.\n\u201cOut of curiosity,\u201d Kvothe asked. \u201cWhat would you do if something knocked back?\u201d\nBast came to his feet, left the room, and returned a moment later with an", "assortment of tools. He got to one knee and, using a piece of bent wire, fiddled with the copper lock for several long minutes. Eventually he began to curse under his breath. When he shifted position to get a different angle, his hand brushed the dull iron faceplate of the lock and he jerked back, hissing and spitting.\nGetting back to his feet, Bast threw down the wire and brought out a long prybar of bright metal. He tried to work the thin end of it under the lid, but couldn\u2019t gain any purchase in the hair-thin seam. After a few minutes he abandoned this as well.\nNext, Bast tried to tip the chest on its side to examine the bottom, but his best efforts only managed to slide it an inch or so across the floor. \u201cHow much does this weigh, Reshi?\u201d Bast exclaimed, looking rather exasperated. \u201cThree hundred pounds?\u201d\n\u201cOver four hundred when it\u2019s empty,\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cRemember the trouble we had getting it up the stairs?\u201d\nSighing, Bast examined the chest for another long moment, his expression fierce. Then he extracted a hatchet from his bundle of tools. It wasn\u2019t the rough, wedge-headed hatchet they used to cut kindling behind the inn. It was slender and menacing, all forged of a single piece of metal. The shape of its blade was vaguely reminiscent of a leaf.\nHe tossed the weapon lightly in his palm, as if testing its weight. \u201cThis is where I would go next, Reshi. If I were genuinely interested in getting inside.\u201d He gave his teacher a curious look. \u201cBut if you\u2019d rather I not. . . .\u201d\nKvothe made a helpless gesture. \u201cDon\u2019t look to me, Bast. I\u2019m dead. Do as you will.\u201d\nBast grinned and brought the hatchet down on the rounded peak of the chest. There was a strange, soft, ringing noise, like a padded bell being struck in a distant room.\nBast paused, then rained a flurry of angry blows down on the top of the chest. First swinging wildly with one hand, then using both hands in great overhand chopping motions, as if he were splitting wood.\nThe bright, leaf-shaped blade refused to bite into the wood, each blow turning aside as if Bast were attempting to chop apart a great, seamless block of stone.\nEventually Bast stopped, breathing hard, and bent to look at the top of the chest, running his hand over the surface before turning his attention to the hatchet\u2019s blade. He sighed. \u201cYou do good work, Reshi.\u201d", "Kvothe smiled and tipped an imaginary hat.\nBast gave the chest a long look. \u201cI\u2019d try to set fire to it, but I know Roah doesn\u2019t burn. I\u2019d have better luck getting it hot enough so the copper lock would melt. But to do that, I\u2019d need to get the whole thing to sit face down in a forge fire.\u201d He looked at the chest, large as a gentleman\u2019s traveling trunk. \u201cBut it would have to be a bigger forge than the one we have here in town. And I don\u2019t even know how hot copper needs to be in order to melt.\u201d\n\u201cInformation such as that,\u201d Kvothe said, \u201cwould doubtless be the subject of a book lesson.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I expect you\u2019ve taken precautions against that sort of thing.\u201d\n\u201cI have,\u201d Kvothe admitted. \u201cBut it was a good idea. It shows lateral thinking.\u201d\n\u201cAnd acid?\u201d Bast said. \u201cI know we have some potent stuff downstairs. . . .\u201d\n\u201cFormic is useless against Roah.\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cAs is the muriatic. You might have some luck with Aqua Regius. But the wood is quite thick, and we don\u2019t have much on hand.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking of the wood, Reshi. I was thinking of the locks again. With enough acid I could eat clean through them.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re assuming they are copper and iron all the way through,\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cEven if they were, it would take a great deal of acid, and you would have to worry about the acid itself spilling into the chest, ruining whatever\u2019s inside. The same is true with the fire, of course.\u201d\nBast looked at the chest for another long moment, stroking his lips thoughtfully. \u201cThat\u2019s all I have, Reshi. I\u2019ll need to think on it some more.\u201d\nKvothe nodded. Looking somewhat disheartened, Bast gathered up his tools and carried them away. When he returned, he pushed the chest from the other side, sliding it back a fraction of an inch until it was square with the foot of the bed again.\n\u201cIt was a good attempt, Bast,\u201d Kvothe reassured him. \u201cVery methodical. You went about it just as I would have.\u201d\n\u201cHullo?\u201d the mayor\u2019s voice came hollowly up from the room below. \u201cI\u2019m finished.\u201d\nBast hopped up and hurried to the door, pushing his chair back under the desk. The sudden motion disturbed one of the crumpled sheets of paper resting there, causing it to tumble to the floor where it bounced and rolled beneath the chair.\nBast paused, then bent to pick it up.", "\u201cNo,\u201d Kvothe said grimly. \u201cLeave it.\u201d Bast stopped with his hand outstretched, then stood and left the room.\nKvothe followed, closing the door behind them.", "CHAPTER SEVENTY-TWO\nHorses\nSEVERAL DAYS AFTER DENNA and I had our moonlit stroll in the garden, I finished a song for Meluan called \u201cNothing but Roses.\u201d The Maer specifically requested it, and I had leapt to the project with a will, knowing that Denna would laugh herself sick when I played it for her.\nI slid the Maer\u2019s song into an envelope and looked at the clock. I\u2019d thought I\u2019d be busy the entire night finishing it, but it had come with surprising ease. Consequently, I had the rest of the evening free. It was late, but not terribly late. Not late for Cendling night in a lively city like Severen. Perhaps not too late to find Denna.\nI threw on a set of fresh clothes and hurried out of the estates. Since the money in my purse came from selling pieces of Caudicus\u2019 equipment and playing cards with nobles who knew more about fashion than statistics, I paid the full bit for the horse lifts, then jogged the half-mile to Newell Street. I slowed to a walk for the last several blocks. Enthusiasm is flattering, but I didn\u2019t want to arrive at Denna\u2019s inn panting and sweating like a lathered horse.\nI wasn\u2019t surprised when I didn\u2019t find her at the Four Tapers. Denna wasn\u2019t the sort to sit and twiddle her thumbs just because I was busy. But the two of us had spent the better part of a month exploring the city together, and I had a few good guesses as to where I might find her.\nFive minutes later I spotted her. She was moving through the crowded street with a definite purpose, walking as if she had somewhere important to be.\nI started to make my way toward her, then hesitated. Where would she be going so purposefully, alone, so late at night?\nShe was going to meet her patron.\nI wish I could say I agonized before I decided to follow her, but I really didn\u2019t. The temptation of finally learning the identity of her patron was simply too strong.", "So I put up the hood of my cloak and began to ghost through the crowd behind Denna. It\u2019s remarkably easy if you have a little practice. I used to make a game of it in Tarbean, seeing how far I could follow someone without being seen. It helped that Denna wasn\u2019t a fool and stayed in the good parts of the city where the streets were busy, and in the dim light my cloak looked a nondescript black.\nI followed her for half an hour. We passed cart vendors selling chestnuts and greasy meat pies. Guards mingled with the crowd, and the streets were bright with scattered streetlights and lanterns hung outside the doors of inns. An occasional out-at-the-heels musician played with his hat in front of him, and once we passed a troupe of mummers acting out a play in a small cobblestone square.\nThen Denna turned and left the better streets behind. Soon there were fewer lights and tipsy revelers. The musicians gave way to beggars who called out or clutched at your clothes as you walked by. Lamplight still poured through the windows of nearby pubs and inns, but the street was no longer bustling. People clustered in twos or threes, women wearing corsets and men with hard eyes.\nThese streets weren\u2019t dangerous, strictly speaking. Or rather, they were dangerous in a broken glass sort of way. Broken glass won\u2019t go out of its way to hurt you. You can even touch it if you\u2019re careful. Some streets are dangerous as frothing dogs, where no amount of care will keep you safe.\nI was beginning to get nervous when I saw Denna stop suddenly at the mouth of a shadowed alley. She craned her neck for a moment, as if listening to something. Then, after peering into the dark, she darted inside.\nWas this where she was meeting her patron? Was she taking a shortcut to a different street? Or was she simply following her paranoid patron\u2019s instructions to make sure no one followed her?\nI began to curse under my breath. If I followed her into the alley and she saw me, it would be obvious I\u2019d been trailing her. But if I didn\u2019t follow her, I\u2019d lose her. And while this wasn\u2019t a truly dangerous part of the city, I didn\u2019t want to leave her walking alone so late at night.\nSo I scanned the nearby buildings and spotted one fronted with crumbling fieldstone. After a quick glance around, I climbed the face of it quick as a squirrel, another useful skill from my misspent youth.\nOnce I was on the roof, it was a simple matter to run over the tops of several other buildings, then slink into the shadow of a chimney before", "peering down into the alley. There was a sliver of moon overhead, and I expected to see Denna striding quickly along her shortcut, or having a hushed and hidden meeting with her dodgy patron.\nBut what I saw was nothing of the sort. Dim lamplight from an upstairs window showed a woman splayed out motionless on the ground. My heart thudded hard for several beats until I realized it wasn\u2019t Denna. Denna was dressed in shirt and pants. This woman\u2019s white dress was crumpled around her, her bare legs pale against the dark stone of the street.\nMy eyes darted around until I saw Denna outside the window\u2019s light. She stood close to a broad-shouldered man with moonlight shining on his bald head. Was she embracing him? Was this her patron?\nFinally my eyes adjusted enough that I could see the truth: the two were standing very close and still, but she wasn\u2019t holding him. She had one hand hard against his neck, and I saw white moonlight glitter on metal there, like a distant star.\nThe woman on the ground started to stir, and Denna called out to her. The woman climbed unsteadily to her feet, staggering a bit as she stepped on her own dress, then edged slowly past them, keeping close to the wall as she made her way to the mouth of the alley.\nOnce the woman was behind her, Denna said something else. I was too far away to make out any of the words, but her voice was hard and angry enough to raise the hair on the back of my arms.\nDenna stepped away from the man and he backed away, one hand going to the side of his throat. He began to curse her viciously, spitting and making grasping motions with his free hand. His voice was louder than hers, but slurred enough that I couldn\u2019t make out much of what he said, though I did identify the word \u201cwhore\u201d several times.\nBut for all his talk, he didn\u2019t come anywhere close to within arm\u2019s reach of her. Denna simply stood facing him, her feet set squarely on the ground. She held the knife low in front of her, tilted at an angle. Her posture was almost casual. Almost.\nAfter cursing for a minute or so, the man took half a shuffling step forward, shaking a fist. Denna said something and made a short, sharp gesture with the knife towards the man\u2019s groin. Silence filled the alley and the man\u2019s shoulders shifted a bit. Denna made the gesture again, and the man began to curse more softly, turning away and walking down the alley, his hand still pressed to the side of his neck.", "Denna watched him go, then relaxed and slid the knife carefully into her pocket. She turned and walked to the mouth of the alleyway.\nI scurried to the front of the building. On the street below I saw Denna and the other woman standing under a streetlamp. In the better light I saw the woman was much younger than I\u2019d thought, just a slip of a girl, her shoulders heaving with sobs. Denna rubbed her back in small circles, and the girl slowly calmed down. After a moment they began walking down the street.\nI hurried back to the alley where I had spotted an old iron drainpipe, a relatively easy way to get back down onto the street. But even so it cost me two long minutes and most of the skin off my knuckles to get cobblestones back under my feet.\nOnly through a pure effort of will did I keep myself from running out of the alley to catch up with Denna and the girl. The last thing I wanted was for Denna to discover I\u2019d been following her.\nLuckily, they weren\u2019t moving very fast, and I caught sight of them easily. Denna led the girl back to the nicer part of the city, then took her into a respectable-looking inn with a painted rooster on the sign.\nI stood outside for a minute, peering at the layout of the inn through one of the windows. Then I settled my hood more firmly over my face, walked casually around the back portion of the inn, and slid into a seat on the other side of a dividing wall, just around the corner from Denna and the young girl. If I\u2019d wanted to, I could have leaned forward to peer at their table, but as it was, neither one of us could see the other.\nThe taproom was mostly empty, and a serving girl came up to me almost as soon as I took my seat. She eyed the rich fabric of my cloak and smiled. \u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d\nI eyed the impressive array of polished glass behind the bar. I motioned the serving girl closer and spoke softly, with a rasp in my throat, as if I were recovering from the croup cough. \u201cI\u2019ll take a tumble of your best whiskey,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd a glass of fine Feloran red.\u201d\nShe nodded and left.\nI turned my finely tuned eavesdroppers\u2019 ears to the next table.\n\u201c. . . your accent,\u201d I heard Denna say. \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d\nThere was a pause and a murmur as the girl spoke. Since she was facing\naway from me, I couldn\u2019t hear what she said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s in the western farrel isn\u2019t it?\u201d Denna asked. \u201cYou\u2019re a long way\nfrom home.\u201d", "There was murmuring from the girl. Then a long pause where I couldn\u2019t hear anything. I couldn\u2019t tell if she\u2019d stopped talking, or if she was speaking too quietly for me to hear. I fought the urge to lean forward and peer at their table.\nThen the murmuring came back, very soft.\n\u201cI know he said he loved you,\u201d Denna said, her voice gentle. \u201cThey all say that.\u201d\nThe serving girl set a tall wineglass in front of me and handed me my tumble. \u201cTwo bits.\u201d\nMerciful Tehlu. With prices like that, no wonder the place was nearly empty.\nI tossed back the whiskey in a single swallow, fighting the urge to cough as it burned down my throat. Then I drew a full silver round out of my purse, set the heavy coin on the table, and put the empty tumble down over the top of it.\nI motioned the serving girl close again. \u201cI have a proposal for you,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cRight now I want nothing more than to sit here quietly, drink my wine, and think my thoughts.\u201d\nI tapped the overturned tumble with the coin underneath. \u201cIf I am allowed to do this without interruption, all of this, less the cost of my drinks, is yours.\u201d Her eyes went a little wide at that, darting down to the coin again. \u201cBut if anyone comes over to bother me, even in a helpful way, even to ask if I would like anything to drink, I will simply pay and leave.\u201d I looked up at her. \u201cCan you help me get a little privacy tonight?\u201d\nShe nodded eagerly.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said.\nShe hurried away and went immediately to another woman standing\nbehind the bar, making a few gestures in my direction. I relaxed a bit, reasonably certain they wouldn\u2019t be drawing any attention to me.\nI sipped my wine and listened.\n\u201c. . . does your father do?\u201d Denna asked. I recognized the pitch of her voice. It was the same low, gentle tone my father had used when talking to skittish animals. A tone designed to calm someone and set them at their ease.\nThe girl murmured, and Denna responded. \u201cThat\u2019s a fine job. What are you doing here then?\u201d\nAnother murmur.\n\u201cGot handsy, did he?\u201d Denna said matter-of-factly. \u201cWell that\u2019s the nature of eldest sons.\u201d", "The girl spoke up again, this time with some fire in her voice, though I still couldn\u2019t make out any of the words.\nI buffed the surface of my wineglass a little with the edge of my cloak, then tipped it out and away from me a bit. The wine was so deep a red that it was almost black. It made the side of the glass act like a mirror. Not a wonderful mirror, but I could see tiny shapes at the table around the corner.\nI heard Denna sigh, cutting off the low murmur of the girl\u2019s voice. \u201cLet me guess,\u201d Denna said, sounding exasperated. \u201cYou stole the silver, or something similar, then ran off to the city.\u201d\nThe small reflection of the girl just sat there.\n\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t like you thought it would be, was it?\u201d Denna said, more gently this time.\nI could see the girl\u2019s shoulders begin to shake and heard a series of faint, heartbreaking sobs. I looked away from the wineglass and set it back on the table.\n\u201cHere.\u201d There was the sound of a glass being knocked onto the table. \u201cDrink that,\u201d Denna said. \u201cIt will help a bit. Not a lot. But a bit.\u201d\nThe sobbing stopped. The girl gave a surprised cough, choking a little.\n\u201cYou poor, silly thing,\u201d Denna said softly. \u201cMeeting you is worse than looking in a mirror.\u201d\nFor the first time, the girl spoke loudly enough for me to hear her. \u201cI thought, if he\u2019s going to take me anyway and get it for free, I might as well go somewhere I can pick and choose and get paid for it. . . .\u201d\nHer voice trailed off until I couldn\u2019t make out any words, leaving only the low rise and fall of her muffled voice.\n\u201cThe Tenpenny King?\u201d Denna interrupted incredulously. Her tone more venomous than anything I\u2019d ever heard from her before. \u201cKist and crayle, I hate that Goddamn play. Modegan faerie-story trash. The world doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d\n\u201cBut . . .\u201d the girl began.\nDenna cut her off. \u201cThere\u2019s no young prince out there, dressed in rags and waiting to save you. Even if there were, where would you be? You\u2019d be like a dog he\u2019d found in the gutter. He\u2019d own you. After he took you home, who would save you from him?\u201d\nA piece of silence. The girl coughed again, but only a little. \u201cSo what are we going to do with you?\u201d Denna said.\nThe girl sniffed and said something.", "\u201cIf you could take care of yourself we wouldn\u2019t be sitting here,\u201d Denna said.\nA murmur.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an option,\u201d Denna said. \u201cThey\u2019ll take half of what you make, but that\u2019s better than getting nothing and having your throat slit on top of it. I\u2019m guessing you figured that out yourself tonight.\u201d\nThere was the sound of cloth on cloth. I tipped my wineglass to get a look, but all I saw was Denna making some indistinct motion. \u201cLet\u2019s see what we have here,\u201d she said. Then there came the familiar clatter of coins on a table.\nThe girl made an awed murmur.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d Denna said. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much when it\u2019s all your money in the world. You should know by now how expensive it is to make your own way in the city.\u201d\nA murmur that rose at the end. A question.\nI heard Denna draw a breath, then let it out again slowly. \u201cBecause someone helped me once when I needed it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd because if you don\u2019t get some help you\u2019ll be dead in a span of days. Take it from someone who\u2019s made her own share of bad decisions.\u201d\nThere was the sound of coins sliding on the table. \u201cOkay,\u201d Denna said. \u201cFirst option. We get you apprenticed up. You\u2019re a little old, and it will cost, but we could do it. Nothing fancy. Weaving. Cobbling. They\u2019ll work you hard, but you\u2019d have your room and board, and you\u2019d learn a trade.\u201d\nA questioning murmur.\n\u201cWith your accent?\u201d Denna asked archly. \u201cCan you curl a lady\u2019s hair? Paint her face? Mend her dress? Tat lace?\u201d A pause. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t have the training to be a maidservant, and I wouldn\u2019t know who to bribe.\u201d\nThe sound of coins being gathered together. \u201cOption two,\u201d Denna said. \u201cWe get you a room until that bruise is gone.\u201d Coins sliding. \u201cThen buy you a seat on a coach back home.\u201d More coins. \u201cYou\u2019ve been gone a month. That\u2019s the perfect amount of time for some serious worry to set in. When you come home they\u2019ll just be happy you\u2019re alive.\u201d\nMurmur.\n\u201cTell them whatever you like,\u201d Denna said. \u201cBut if you\u2019ve got half a brain in your head you\u2019ll make it sensible. Nobody\u2019s going to believe you met some prince who sent you home.\u201d\nA murmur so soft I could hardly hear it.\n\u201cOf course it will be hard, you silly little bint,\u201d Denna said sharply.", "\u201cThey\u2019ll hold it over your head for the rest of your life. Folk will whisper when you walk by on the street. It will be hard to find a husband. You\u2019ll lose friends. But that\u2019s the price you\u2019ll have to pay if you want to have anything like your normal life back again.\u201d\nThe coins clinked as they were gathered together again. \u201cThird option. If you\u2019re certain you want to make a go of whoring, we can arrange it so you don\u2019t end up dead in a ditch. You\u2019ve got a nice face, but you\u2019ll need proper clothes.\u201d Coins sliding. \u201cAnd someone to teach you manners.\u201d More coins. \u201cAnd someone else to get rid of that accent of yours.\u201d Coins again.\nMurmur.\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s the only sensible way to do it,\u201d Denna said flatly. Another murmur.\nDenna gave a tight, irritated sigh. \u201cOkay. Your father\u2019s stable master,\nright? Think about the different horses the baron owns: plow horses, carriage horses, hunting horses. . . .\u201d\nExcited murmur.\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Denna said. \u201cSo if you had to pick, what sort of horse would you want to be? A plow horse works hard, but does it get the best stall? The best feed?\u201d\nMurmur.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. That goes to the fancy horses. They get petted and fed and only have to work when there\u2019s a parade or someone goes hunting.\u201d\nDenna continued, \u201cSo if you\u2019re going to be a whore, you do it smart. You don\u2019t want to be some dockside drab, you want to be a duchess. You want men to court you. Send you gifts.\u201d\nMurmur.\n\u201cYes, gifts. If they pay, they\u2019ll feel like they own you. You saw how that turned out tonight. You can keep your accent and that low bodice and have sailors paw you for ha\u2019penny a throw. Or you can learn some manners, get your hair done, and start entertaining gentlemen callers. If you\u2019re interesting, and pretty, and you know how to listen, men will desire your company. They\u2019ll want to take you dancing as much as take you to bed. Then you have the control. Nobody makes a duchess pay for her room in advance. Nobody bends a duchess over a barrel in an alley then kicks out her teeth once he\u2019s had his fun.\u201d\nMurmur.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Denna said, her voice grim. There was the sound of coins being", "clinked softly into a purse. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to yourself. Even the fanciest horse is still a horse. That means sooner or later, you\u2019re going to get ridden.\u201d\nA questioning murmur.\n\u201cThen you leave,\u201d Denna said. \u201cIf they want more than you\u2019re willing to give, that\u2019s the only way. You leave, quick and quiet in the night. But if you do, you\u2019ll burn your bridges. That\u2019s the price you pay.\u201d\nA hesitant murmur.\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that,\u201d Denna said. \u201cYou need to decide what you want for yourself. You want to go home? There\u2019s a price. You want control over your life? There\u2019s a price. You want the freedom to say no? There\u2019s a price. There\u2019s always a price.\u201d\nThere was the sound of a chair being pushed away from a table, and I pressed myself back against the wall as I heard the two of them stand up. \u201cIt\u2019s something everyone has to figure out on their own,\u201d Denna said, her voice growing more distant. \u201cWhat do you want more than anything else? What do you want so badly you\u2019ll pay anything to get it?\u201d\nI sat for a long time after they left, trying to drink my wine.", "CHAPTER SEVENTY-THREE\nBlood and Ink\nIN THE THEOPHANY, Teccam writes of secrets, calling them painful treasures of the mind. He explains that what most people think of as secrets are really nothing of the sort. Mysteries, for example, are not secrets. Neither are little-known facts or forgotten truths. A secret, Teccam explains, is true knowledge actively concealed.\nPhilosophers have quibbled over his definition for centuries. They point out the logical problems with it, the loopholes, the exceptions. But in all this time none of them has managed to come up with a better definition. That, perhaps, tells us more than all the quibbling combined.\nIn a later chapter, less argued over and less well-known, Teccam explains that there are two types of secrets. There are secrets of the mouth and secrets of the heart.\nMost secrets are secrets of the mouth. Gossip shared and small scandals whispered. These secrets long to be let loose upon the world. A secret of the mouth is like a stone in your boot. At first you\u2019re barely aware of it. Then it grows irritating, then intolerable. Secrets of the mouth grow larger the longer you keep them, swelling until they press against your lips. They fight to be let free.\nSecrets of the heart are different. They are private and painful, and we want nothing more than to hide them from the world. They do not swell and press against the mouth. They live in the heart, and the longer they are kept, the heavier they become.\nTeccam claims it is better to have a mouthful of poison than a secret of the heart. Any fool will spit out poison, he says, but we hoard these painful treasures. We swallow hard against them every day, forcing them deep inside us. There they sit, growing heavier, festering. Given enough time, they cannot help but crush the heart that holds them.\nModern philosophers scorn Teccam, but they are vultures picking at the bones of a giant. Quibble all you like, Teccam understood the shape of the", "world.\nThe day after I\u2019d followed Denna through the city, she sent me a note, and I met her outside the Four Tapers. We\u2019d met there dozens of times in the last several span, but today something was different. Today Denna wore a long, elegant dress, not layered and high necked in the current fashion, but close fitting and open at the throat. It was a deep blue, and when she took a step I could glimpse a long stretch of her bare leg beneath.\nHer harp case leaned against the wall behind her, and she had an expectant look in her eye. Her dark hair was lustrous in the sunlight, unadorned except for three narrow braids tied with blue string. She was barefoot, and her feet were grass-stained. She smiled.\n\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d she said, excitement thrumming through her voice like distant thunder. \u201cDone enough to play you a piece at any rate. Would you like to hear it?\u201d I caught a bit of well-hidden shyness in her voice.\nAs we were both working for patrons who valued their privacy, Denna and I didn\u2019t often discuss our work. We compared our ink-stained fingers and bemoaned our difficulties, but only in vague ways.\n\u201cI\u2019d like nothing better than to hear it,\u201d I said as Denna picked up her harp case and started down the street. I fell into step beside her. \u201cBut won\u2019t your patron mind?\u201d\nDenna gave a too-casual shrug. \u201cHe says he wants my first song to be something that men will sing for a hundred years, so I doubt he\u2019ll want me to keep it bottled up forever.\u201d She gave me a sideways look. \u201cWe\u2019ll go somewhere private and I\u2019ll let you hear. So long as you don\u2019t go shouting it from rooftops, I should be safe.\u201d\nWe started walking to the western gate by unspoken agreement. \u201cI\u2019d have brought my lute,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I finally found a luthier I trust. I\u2019m having that loose peg mended.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll serve me best as audience today,\u201d she said. \u201cSit rapt in admiration as I play. Tomorrow I\u2019ll watch you, all dewy-eyed with wonder. I\u2019ll marvel at your skill and wit and charm.\u201d She moved her harp to her other shoulder and grinned at me. \u201cProvided you aren\u2019t having them mended at the shop.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m always up for a duet,\u201d I suggested. \u201cHarp and lute is rare but not\n \nunheard of.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s delicately phrased.\u201d She glanced sideways at me. \u201cI\u2019ll think on it.\u201d As I had a dozen times before, I fought the urge to tell her I\u2019d reclaimed\nher ring from Ambrose. I wanted to tell her the story of it, mistakes and all. But I was fairly certain the romantic impact of my gesture would be diminished by the end of the story, where I\u2019d effectively pawned the ring before I left Imre. Better to keep it a secret for now, I thought, and surprise her with the ring itself.\n\u201cSo what would you think,\u201d I asked, \u201cof having Maer Alveron for your patron?\u201d\nDenna stopped walking and turned to look at me. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m currently in his good graces,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd he owes me a favor or two. I know you\u2019ve been looking for a patron.\u201d\n\u201cI have a patron,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cOne I\u2019ve earned on my own.\u201d\n\u201cYou have half a patron,\u201d I protested. \u201cWhere\u2019s your writ of patronage? Your Master Ash might be able to give you some financial support, but the more important half of a patron is their name. It\u2019s like armor. It\u2019s like a key that opens\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI know how a patronage works,\u201d Denna said, cutting me off.\n\u201cThen you know yours is shortchanging you,\u201d I said. \u201cIf the Maer had been your patron when things went wrong at that wedding, no one in that shabby little town would have dared to raise their voice to you, let alone their hand. Even from a thousand miles away the Maer\u2019s name would have protected you. He would have kept you safe.\u201d\n\u201cA patron can offer more than a name and money,\u201d Denna said with an edge to her voice. \u201cI\u2019m fine without the shelter of a title, and honestly, I\u2019d be irritated if some man wanted to dress me in his colors. My patron gives me other things. He knows things I need to know.\u201d She gave me an irritated look as she flicked her hair over her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ve told you all this before. I\u2019m content with him for now.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not have both?\u201d I suggested. \u201cThe Maer in public and your Master Ash in secret. Surely he couldn\u2019t object to that. Alveron could probably even look into this other fellow for you, make sure he\u2019s not trying to win you with false\u2014\u201d\nDenna gave me a horrified look. \u201cNo. God no.\u201d She turned to me, her expression earnest. \u201cPromise me you won\u2019t try to find out anything about him. It could ruin everything. You\u2019re the only one I\u2019ve told in all the wide", "world, but he\u2019d be furious if he knew I\u2019d mentioned him to anyone.\u201d\nI felt a bizarre glow of pride at this. \u201cIf you\u2019d really rather I not . . .\u201d Denna stopped walking and set her harp case down on the cobblestones\nwhere it made a hollow thump. Her expression was deadly serious. \u201cPromise me.\u201d\nI probably wouldn\u2019t have agreed if I hadn\u2019t spent half the previous night following her around the city with the hope of discovering this very thing. But I had. Then I\u2019d eavesdropped on her, too. So today I was practically sweating with guilt.\n\u201cI promise,\u201d I said. When her anxious look didn\u2019t evaporate I added, \u201cDon\u2019t you trust me? I\u2019ll swear it, if that will set your mind at ease.\u201d\n\u201cWhat would you swear it on?\u201d she asked, beginning to smile again. \u201cWhat\u2019s important enough that it will hold you to your word?\u201d\n\u201cMy name and my power?\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou are many things,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cBut you are not Taborlin the Great.\u201d\n\u201cMy good right hand?\u201d I suggested.\n\u201cOnly one hand?\u201d she asked, playfulness creeping back into her tone. She reached out and took both of my hands in her own, turning them over and making a show of inspecting them closely. \u201cI like the left one better,\u201d she decided. \u201cSwear by that one.\u201d\n\u201cMy good left hand?\u201d I asked dubiously.\n\u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u201cThe right. You\u2019re such a traditionalist.\u201d\n\u201cI swear I won\u2019t attempt to uncover your patron,\u201d I said bitterly. \u201cI swear it\non my name and my power. I swear it by my good left hand. I swear it by the ever-moving moon.\u201d\nDenna peered at me closely, as if she wasn\u2019t sure if I was mocking her. \u201cFine,\u201d she said with a shrug, picking up her harp. \u201cConsider me reassured.\u201d\nWe started walking again, moving through the western gates and into the countryside. The silence between us stretched, starting to grow uncomfortable.\nWorried things would grow awkward, I said the first thing that came to mind. \u201cSo, are there any new men in your life?\u201d\nDenna chuckled low in her throat. \u201cNow you sound like Master Ash. He\u2019s always asking after them. He doesn\u2019t think any of my suitors are good enough for me.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t agree more, but decided it wouldn\u2019t be prudent to say so. \u201cAnd", "what does he think of me?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, confused. \u201cOh. He doesn\u2019t know about you,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhy would he?\u201d\nI tried to give a nonchalant shrug, but I couldn\u2019t have been very convincing\nas she burst out laughing. \u201cPoor Kvothe. I\u2019m teasing you. I only tell him about the ones that come prowling around, panting and sniffing like dogs. You\u2019re not like them. You\u2019ve always been different.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always prided myself on my lack of panting and sniffing.\u201d\nDenna turned her shoulder and let her swinging harp bump me playfully. \u201cYou know what I mean. They come and go with little gain or loss. You are the gold behind the windblown dross. Master Ash might think he has a right to know about my personal affairs, my comings and goings.\u201d She scowled a bit. \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m willing to concede some of that, for now. . . .\u201d\nShe reached out and took hold of my upper arm possessively. \u201cBut you are not part of the bargain,\u201d she said, her voice almost fierce. \u201cYou are mine. Mine alone. I don\u2019t intend to share you.\u201d\nThe momentary tension passed, and we walked the wide west road away from Severen, laughing and talking of small things. Half a mile past the city\u2019s last inn was a quiet patch of trees with a single tall greystone nestled in its center. We had found it while searching for wild strawberries, and it had become one of our favorite places to escape the noise and stink of the city.\nDenna sat at the base of the greystone and put her back against it. Then she brought her harp out of its case and pulled it close to her chest, causing her dress to gather and expose a scandalous amount of leg. She arched an eyebrow at me and smirked as if she knew exactly what I was thinking.\n\u201cNice harp,\u201d I said casually.\nShe snorted indelicately.\nI sat where I was, sprawling comfortably on the long, cool grass. I tugged a\nfew strands of it out of the ground and idly began to twist them together into a braid.\nHonestly, I was nervous. While we had spent a great deal of time together over the last month, I\u2019d never heard Denna play anything of her own creation. We had sung together, and I knew she had a voice like honey on warm bread. I knew her fingers were sure, and she had a musician\u2019s timing. . . .\nBut writing a song isn\u2019t the same as playing one. What if hers wasn\u2019t any good? What would I say?\nDenna spread her fingers to the strings, and my worries faded to the", "background. I\u2019ve always found something powerfully erotic about the way a woman puts her hands to a harp. She began a rolling gliss down the strings from high to low. The sound of it was like hammers on bells, like water over stones, like birdsong through the air.\nShe stopped and tuned a string. Plucked, tuned. She struck a sharp chord, a hard chord, a lingering chord, then turned to look at me, flexing her fingers nervously. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re incredible,\u201d I said.\nI saw her flush a little, then brush her hair back to hide her reaction. \u201cFool. I haven\u2019t played you anything yet.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re incredible all the same.\u201d\n\u201cHush.\u201d She struck a hard chord and let it fade into a quiet melody. As it rose and fell, she spoke the introduction to her song. I was surprised at such a traditional opening. Surprised but pleased. Old ways are best.\nGather round and listen well,\nFor I\u2019ve a tale of tragedy to tell.\nI sing of subtle shadow spread\nAcross a land, and of the man\nWho turned his hand toward a purpose few could bear. Fair Lanre: stripped of wife, of life, of pride\nStill never from his purpose swayed.\nWho fought the tide, and fell, and was betrayed.\nAt first it was her voice that caught my breath, then it was the music.\nBut before ten lines had passed her lips I was stunned for different reasons. She sang the story of Myr Tariniel\u2019s fall. Of Lanre\u2019s betrayal. It was the story I had heard from Skarpi in Tarbean.\nBut Denna\u2019s version was different. In her song, Lanre was painted in tragic tones, a hero wrongly used. Selitos\u2019 words were cruel and biting, Myr Tariniel a warren that was better for the purifying fire. Lanre was no traitor, but a fallen hero.\nSo much depends upon where you stop a story, and hers ended when Lanre was cursed by Selitos. It was the perfect ending for a tragedy. In her story Lanre was wronged, misunderstood. Selitos was a tyrant, an insane monster who tore out his own eye in fury at Lanre\u2019s clever trickery. It was dreadfully, painfully wrong.", "Despite this, it had the first glimmers of beauty to it. The chords well- chosen. The rhyme subtle and strong. The song was very fresh, and there were rough patches aplenty, but I could feel the shape of it. I saw what it could become. It would turn men\u2019s minds. They would sing it for a hundred years.\nYou\u2019ve probably heard it, in fact. Most folk have. She ended up calling it \u201cThe Song of Seven Sorrows.\u201d Yes. Denna composed it, and I was the first person to hear it played entire.\nAs the last notes faded in the air, Denna lowered her hands, unwilling to meet my eye.\nI sat, still and silent on the grass.\nFor this to make sense, you need to understand something every musician knows. Singing a new song is a nervous thing. More than that. It\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s like undressing for the first time in front of a new lover. It\u2019s a delicate moment.\nI needed to say something. A compliment. A comment. A joke. A lie. Anything was better than silence.\nBut I couldn\u2019t have been more stunned if she had written a hymn praising the Duke of Gibea. The shock was simply too much for me. I felt raw as reused parchment, as if every note of her song had been another flick of a knife, scraping until I was entirely blank and wordless.\nI looked down dumbly at my hands. They still held the half-formed circle of green grass I\u2019d been weaving when the song began. It was a broad, flat plait already beginning to curve into the shape of a ring.\nStill looking down, I heard the rustle of Denna\u2019s skirts as she moved. I needed to say something. I\u2019d already waited too long. There was too much silence in the air.\n\u201cThe city\u2019s name wasn\u2019t Mirinitel,\u201d I said without looking up. It was not the worst thing I could have said. But it wasn\u2019t the right thing to say.\nThere was a pause. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cNot Mirinitel,\u201d I repeated. \u201cThe city Lanre burned was Myr Tariniel. Sorry to tell you that. Changing a name is hard work. It will wreck the meter in a third of your verses.\u201d I was surprised at how quiet my voice was, how flat and dead it sounded in my own ears.\nI heard her draw a surprised breath. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard the story before?\u201d\nI looked up at Denna, her expression excited. I nodded, still feeling oddly blank. Empty. Hollow as a dried gourd. \u201cWhat made you pick this for a", "song?\u201d I asked her.\nIt wasn\u2019t the right thing to say either. I can\u2019t help but feel that if I\u2019d said\nthe right thing at that moment, everything would have turned out differently. But even now, after years of thinking, I can\u2019t imagine what I could have said that might have made things right.\nHer excitement faded slightly. \u201cI found a version of it in an old book when I was doing genealogical research for my patron,\u201d she said. \u201cHardly anyone remembers it, so it\u2019s perfect for a song. It\u2019s not like the world needs another story about Oren Velciter. I\u2019ll never make my mark repeating what other musicians have already hashed over a hundred times before.\u201d\nDenna gave me a curious look. \u201cI thought I was going to be able to surprise you with something new. I never would have guessed you\u2019d heard of Lanre.\u201d\n\u201cI heard it years ago,\u201d I said numbly. \u201cFrom an old storyteller in Tarbean.\u201d\n\u201cIf I had half your luck . . .\u201d Denna shook her head in dismay. \u201cI had to piece it together out of a hundred little scraps.\u201d She made a conciliatory gesture. \u201cMe and my patron, I should say. He\u2019s helped.\u201d\n\u201cYour patron,\u201d I said. I felt a spark of emotion when she mentioned him. Hollow as I was, it was surprising how quickly the bitterness spread through my gut, as if someone had kindled a fire inside me.\nDenna nodded. \u201cHe fancies himself a bit of a historian,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he\u2019s angling for a court appointment. He wouldn\u2019t be the first to ingratiate himself by shining a light on someone\u2019s long-lost heroic ancestor. Or maybe he\u2019s trying to invent a heroic ancestor for himself. That would explain the research we\u2019ve been doing in old genealogies.\u201d\nShe hesitated for a moment, biting her lips. \u201cThe truth is,\u201d she said, as if confessing something. \u201cI half suspect the song is for Alveron himself. Master Ash has implied he\u2019s had dealings with the Maer.\u201d She gave a mischievous grin. \u201cWho knows? Running in the circles you do, you might have already met my patron and not even known it.\u201d\nMy mind flickered over the hundreds of nobles and courtiers I\u2019d met in passing over the last month, but it was hard to focus on their faces. The fire in my gut was spreading until my whole chest was full of it.\n\u201cBut enough of this,\u201d Denna said, waving her hands impatiently. She pushed her harp away and folded her legs to sit cross-legged on the grass. \u201cYou\u2019re teasing me. What did you think of it?\u201d\nI looked down at my hands and idly fingered the flat braid of green grass", "I\u2019d woven. It was smooth and cool between my fingers. I couldn\u2019t remember how I\u2019d planned to join the ends together to form a ring.\n\u201cI know it\u2019s got some rough patches,\u201d I heard Denna say, her voice brimming with nervous excitement. \u201cI\u2019ll have to fix that name you mentioned, if you\u2019re sure it\u2019s the right one. The beginning is rough, and the seventh verse is a shambles, I know. I need to expand the battles and his relationship with Lyra. The ending needs tightening. But overall, what did you think?\u201d\nOnce she smoothed it out, it would be brilliant. As good a song as my parents might have written, but that just made it worse.\nMy hands were shaking, and I was amazed at how hard it was to make them stop. I looked away from them, up at Denna. Her nervous excitement faded when she saw my face.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to rework more than just the name.\u201d I tried to keep my voice calm. \u201cLanre wasn\u2019t a hero.\u201d\nShe looked at me oddly, as if she couldn\u2019t tell if I was making a joke. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the whole thing wrong,\u201d I said. \u201cLanre was a monster. A traitor. You need to change it.\u201d\nDenna tossed back her head and laughed. When I didn\u2019t join her, she cocked her head, puzzled. \u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d\nI nodded.\nDenna\u2019s face went stiff. Her eyes narrowed and her mouth made a thin line. \u201cYou have to be kidding.\u201d Her mouth worked silently for a moment, then she shook her head. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t make any sense. The whole story falls apart if Lanre isn\u2019t the hero.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about what makes a good story,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s about what\u2019s true.\u201d\n\u201cTrue?\u201d She looked at me incredulously. \u201cThis is just some old folk story. None of the places are real. None of the people are real. You might as well get offended at me for coming up with a new verse for \u2018Tinker Tanner.\u2019 \u201d\nI could feel words rising in my throat, hot as a chimney fire. I swallowed down hard against them. \u201cSome stories are just stories,\u201d I agreed. \u201cBut not this one. It\u2019s not your fault. There\u2019s no way you could have\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh well, thank you,\u201d she said bitingly. \u201cI\u2019m so glad this isn\u2019t my fault.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d I said sharply. \u201cIt is your fault. You should have done more research.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you know about the research I did?\u201d she demanded. \u201cYou", "haven\u2019t the slightest idea! I\u2019ve been all over the world digging up pieces of this story!\u201d\nIt was the same thing my father had done. He\u2019d started writing a song about Lanre, but his research led him to the Chandrian. He\u2019d spent years chasing down half-forgotten stories and digging up rumors. He wanted his song to tell the truth about them, and they had killed my entire troupe to put an end to it.\nI looked down at the grass and thought about the secret I had kept for so long. I thought of the smell of blood and burning hair. I thought of rust and blue fire and the broken bodies of my parents. How could I explain something so huge and horrible? Where would I even begin? I could feel the secret deep inside me, huge and heavy as a stone.\n\u201cIn the version of the story I heard,\u201d I said, touching the far edge of the secret. \u201cLanre became one of the Chandrian. You should be careful. Some stories are dangerous.\u201d\nDenna stared at me for a long moment. \u201cThe Chandrian?\u201d she said incredulously. Then she laughed. It was not her usual delighted laugh. This was sharp and full of derision. \u201cWhat kind of a child are you?\u201d\nI knew exactly how childish it made me sound. I felt myself flush hot with embarrassment, my whole body suddenly prickling with sweat. I opened my mouth to speak, and it felt like cracking open the door of a furnace.\u201cI\u2019m like a child?\u201d I spat. \u201cWhat do you know about anything, you stupid . . .\u201d I almost bit off the end of my tongue to keep from shouting the word whore.\n\u201cYou think you know everything, don\u2019t you?\u201d she demanded. \u201cYou\u2019ve been to the University so you think the rest of us are\u2014\u201d\n\u201cQuit looking for excuses to be upset and listen to me!\u201d I snapped. The words poured out of me like molten iron. \u201cYou\u2019re having a snit like a spoiled little girl!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d She jabbed a finger at me. \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me like I\u2019m some sort of witless farm girl. I know things they don\u2019t teach at your precious University! Secret things! I\u2019m not an idiot!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re acting like an idiot!\u201d I shouted so loudly the words hurt my throat. \u201cYou won\u2019t shut up long enough to listen to me! I\u2019m trying to help you!\u201d Denna sat in the center of a chilly silence. Her eyes were hard and flat.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s all about, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she said coldly. Her fingers moved in her hair, every flick of her fingers stiff with irritation. She untied her braids, smoothed them out, then absentmindedly retied them in a different pattern.", "\u201cYou hate that I won\u2019t take your help. You can\u2019t stand that I won\u2019t let you fix every little thing in my life, is that it?\u201d\n\u201cWell maybe someone needs to fix your life,\u201d I snapped. \u201cYou\u2019ve made a fair mess of it so far, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nShe continued to sit very still, her eyes furious. \u201cWhat makes you think you know anything about my life?\u201d\n\u201cI know you\u2019re so afraid of anyone getting close that you can\u2019t stay in the same bed four days in a row,\u201d I said, hardly knowing what I was saying anymore. Angry words poured out of me like blood from a wound. \u201cI know you live your whole life burning bridges behind you. I know you solve your problems by running\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat makes you think your advice is worth one thin sliver of a damn, anyway?\u201d Denna burst out. \u201cHalf a year ago you had one foot in the gutter. Hair all shaggy and only three raggedy shirts. There isn\u2019t a noble in a hundred miles of Imre that would piss on you if you were on fire. You had to run a thousand miles to have a chance of a patron.\u201d\nMy face burned with shame at her mention of my three shirts, and I felt my temper flare hot again. \u201cYou\u2019re right of course,\u201d I said scathingly. \u201cYou\u2019re much better off. I\u2019m sure your patron would be perfectly happy to piss on you \u2014\u201d\n\u201cNow we get to the heart of it,\u201d she said, throwing her hands up in the air. \u201cYou don\u2019t like my patron because you could get me a better one. You don\u2019t like my song because it\u2019s different from the one you know.\u201d She reached for her harp case, her movements stiff and angry. \u201cYou\u2019re just like all the rest.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to help you!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re trying to fix me,\u201d Denna said crisply as she put away her harp. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to buy me. To arrange my life. You want to keep me like I\u2019m your pet. Like I\u2019m your faithful dog.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d never think of you as a dog,\u201d I said, giving her a bright and brittle smile. \u201cA dog knows how to listen. A dog has sense enough not to bite a hand that\u2019s trying to help.\u201d\nOur conversation spiraled downward from there.\nAt this point in the story I\u2019m tempted to lie. To say I spoke these things in an\n \nuncontrollable rage. That I was overwhelmed with grief at the memory of my murdered family. I\u2019m tempted to say I tasted plum and nutmeg. Then I would have some excuse. . . .\nBut they were my words. In the end, I was the one who said those things. Only me.\nDenna responded in kind, hurt and furious and sharp-tongued as myself. We were both proud and angry and filled with the unshakable certainty of youth. We said things we never would have said otherwise, and when we left, we did not leave together.\nMy temper was hot and bitter as a bar of molten iron. It seared at me as I walked all the way back to Severen. It burned as I made my way through the city and waited for the freight lifts. It smoldered as I stalked through the Maer\u2019s estates and slammed the door to my rooms behind me.\nIt was only hours later that I cooled enough to regret my words. I thought of what I might have said to Denna. I thought of telling her of how my troupe was killed, about the Chandrian.\nI decided I would write her a letter. I would explain it all, no matter how foolish or unbelievable it seemed. I brought out pen and ink and laid a sheet of fine white paper on the writing desk.\nI dipped the pen and tried to think of where I could begin.\nMy parents had been killed when I was eleven. It was an event so huge and horrifying it had driven me nearly mad. In the years since, I had never told a soul of those events. I had never so much as whispered them in an empty room. It was a secret I had clutched so tightly for so long that when I dared think of it, it lay so heavy in my chest that I could barely breathe.\nI dipped the pen again, but no words came. I opened a bottle of wine, thinking it might loosen the secret inside me. Give me some fingerhold I could use to pry it up. I drank until the room spun and the nib of the pen was crusted with dry ink.\nHours later the blank sheet still stared at me, and I beat my fist against the desk in fury and frustration, striking it so hard my hand bled. That is how heavy a secret can become. It can make blood flow easier than ink.", "CHAPTER SEVENTY-FOUR\nRumors\nTHE DAY AFTER I fought with Denna, I woke late in the afternoon, feeling miserable for all the obvious reasons. I ate and bathed, but pride kept me from heading down to Severen-Low to look for Denna. I sent a ring to Bredon, but the runner returned with the news that he was still away from the estate.\nSo I opened a bottle of wine and began to leaf through the pile of stories that had been slowly accumulating in my room. The majority of these were scandalous, spiteful things. But their petty meanness suited my mood and helped distract me from my own misery.\nThus I learned the previous Compte Banbride hadn\u2019t died of consumption, but of syphilis contracted from an amorous stable hand. Lord Veston was addicted to Denner resin, and money intended for the maintenance of the king\u2019s road was paying for his habit.\nBaron Jakis had paid several officials to avoid scandal when his youngest daughter was discovered in a brothel. There were two versions of that story, one where she was selling, and another where she was buying. I filed that information away for future use.\nI\u2019d started a second bottle of wine by the time I read that young Netalia Lackless had run away with a troupe of traveling performers. Her parents had disowned her, of course, leaving Meluan the only heir to the Lackless lands. That explained Meluan\u2019s hatred of the Ruh, and made me doubly glad I hadn\u2019t made my Edema blood public here in Severen.\nThere were three separate stories of how the Duke of Cormisant flew into rages while in his cups, beating whoever happened to be nearby, including his wife, his son, and several dinner guests. There was a brief speculative account of how the king and queen held depraved orgies in their private gardens, hidden from the eyes of the royal court.\nEven Bredon made an appearance. He was said to conduct pagan rituals in the secluded woods outside his northern estates. They were described with", "such extravagant and meticulous detail that I wondered if they weren\u2019t copied directly from the pages of some old Aturan romance.\nI read well into the evening, and was only halfway through the stack of stories when I finished the bottle of wine. I was just about to send a runner for another when I heard the soft hush of air from the other room that announced Alveron\u2019s entrance into my chambers through his secret passage.\nI pretended to look surprised when he entered the room. \u201cGood afternoon, your grace,\u201d I said as I came to my feet.\n\u201cSit if you wish,\u201d he said shortly.\nI remained standing out of deference, as I\u2019d learned it was better to err on the side of formality with the Maer. \u201cHow are things progressing with your lady?\u201d I asked. From Stapes\u2019 excited gossip, I knew matters were rapidly coming to a close.\n\u201cWe pledged a formal troth today,\u201d he said distractedly. \u201cSigned papers and all. It\u2019s done.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019ll forgive me for saying so, your grace, you don\u2019t seem very pleased.\u201d\nHe gave a sour smile. \u201cI suppose you\u2019ve heard about the trouble on the roads of late?\u201d\n\u201cOnly rumors, your grace.\u201d\nHe snorted. \u201cRumors I have been trying to keep quiet. Someone has been waylaying my tax collectors on the north road.\u201d\nThat was serious. \u201cCollectors, your grace?\u201d I asked, stressing the plural. \u201cHow much have they managed to take?\u201d\nThe Maer gave me a stern look that let me know the impropriety of my question. \u201cEnough. More than enough. This is the fourth I\u2019ve had go missing. Over half of my northern taxes taken by highwaymen.\u201d He gave me a serious look. \u201cThe Lackless lands are in the north, you know.\u201d\n\u201cYou think the Lacklesses are waylaying your collectors?\u201d\nHe gave me a stunned look. \u201cWhat? No, no. It\u2019s bandits in the Eld.\u201d I blushed a little in embarrassment. \u201cHave you sent out patrols, your\ngrace?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I\u2019ve sent out patrols,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI\u2019ve sent a dozen. They\nhaven\u2019t found so much as a campfire.\u201d He paused and looked at me. \u201cI suspect someone in my guard is in league with them.\u201d His expression was grave.\n\u201cI assume your grace has given your collectors escorts?\u201d", "\u201cTwo apiece,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you know how much it costs to replace a dozen guardsmen? Armor, weapons, horses?\u201d He sighed. \u201cOn top of it all, only part of the stolen taxes are mine, the rest belong to the king.\u201d\nI nodded an understanding. \u201cI don\u2019t imagine he\u2019s very pleased.\u201d\nAlveron waved a hand dismissively. \u201cOh, Roderic will have his money regardless. He holds me personally responsible for his tithe. So I am forced to send the collectors around again to gather his majesty\u2019s share a second time.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t imagine that sits very well with most people,\u201d I said.\n\u201cIt does not.\u201d He sat in an overstuffed chair and rubbed his face tiredly. \u201cI\u2019m at my wit\u2019s end over the matter. How will it look to Meluan if I cannot keep my own roads safe?\nI took a seat as well, facing him. \u201cWhat of Dagon?\u201d I asked. \u201cCouldn\u2019t he find them?\u201d\nAlveron gave a short, humorless bark of a laugh. \u201cOh, Dagon would find them. He\u2019d have their heads on poles inside ten days.\u201d\n\u201cThen why not send him?\u201d I asked, puzzled.\n\u201cBecause Dagon is a man of straight lines. He would raze a dozen villages and set fire to a thousand acres of the Eld to find them.\u201d He shook his head seriously. \u201cEven if I thought him suited to this task, he is tracking down Caudicus at the moment. Besides, I believe there may be magic at work in the Eld, and that is outside Dagon\u2019s ken.\u201d\nI suspected the only magic at work was half a dozen sturdy Modegan longbows. But it\u2019s the nature of people to cry magic whenever they\u2019re faced with something they cannot easily explain, especially in Vintas.\nAlveron leaned forward in his seat. \u201cMight I rely on your help in this?\u201d There was only one response to that. \u201cOf course, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know much woodcraft?\u201d\n\u201cI studied under a yeoman when I was younger,\u201d I exaggerated, guessing\nhe was looking for someone to help devise a better defense for his collectors. \u201cI know enough to track a man and hide myself.\u201d\nAlveron raised an eyebrow at that. \u201cReally? You are possessed of quite the diverse education, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve led an interesting life, your grace.\u201d The bottle of wine I\u2019d drunk made me bolder than usual, and I added. \u201cI\u2019ve got an idea or two you might find helpful in dealing with your bandit problem.\u201d\nHe leaned forward in his chair. \u201cDo tell.\u201d\n\u201cI could devise some arcane protection for your men.\u201d I made a flourish", "with the long fingers of my right hand, hoping it looked sufficiently mystical. I juggled numbers in my head and wondered how long it would take to create an arrowcatch using only the equipment in Caudicus\u2019 tower.\nAlveron nodded thoughtfully. \u201cThat might suffice if I was only concerned for the safety of my collectors. But this is the king\u2019s road, a major artery of trade. I need to be rid of the bandits themselves.\u201d\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d I said, \u201cI would assemble a small group who know how to make their way quietly in a forest. They shouldn\u2019t have too much difficulty locating your bandits. When they do, it should be a simple matter to send your guard out to catch them.\u201d\n\u201cEasier yet to set an ambush and kill them, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d Alveron said slowly, as if looking to gauge my reaction.\n\u201cOr that,\u201d I admitted. \u201cYour grace is the arm of the law.\u201d\n\u201cDeath is the penalty for banditry. Especially on the king\u2019s road,\u201d Alveron said firmly. \u201cDoes that seem harsh to you?\u201d\n\u201cNot in the least,\u201d I said, looking him squarely in the eye. \u201cSafe roads are the bones of civilization.\u201d\nAlveron surprised me with a sudden smile. \u201cYour plan is the very image of my own. I have gathered a handful of mercenaries to do just as you\u2019ve suggested. I\u2019ve had to move secretly, as I don\u2019t know who might be sending these bandits their warnings. But I\u2019ve got four good men ready to leave tomorrow: a tracker, two mercenaries with some skill in the forest, and an Adem mercenary. The last did not come cheaply, either.\u201d\nI gave him a congratulatory nod. \u201cYou\u2019ve already planned it better than I could, your grace. It hardly seems as if you need my help at all.\u201d\n\u201cQuite the contrary,\u201d he said. \u201cI still need someone with a little sense to lead them.\u201d He looked at me meaningfully. \u201cSomeone who understands magic. Someone I can trust.\u201d\nI felt a sudden sinking sensation.\nAlveron got to his feet, smiling warmly. \u201cTwice now you have served me beyond all expectations. Are you familiar with the expression \u2018third time pays for all\u2019?\u201d\nAgain, there was only one reasonable answer to that question. \u201cYes, your grace.\u201d\n \nAlveron took me to his rooms, and we looked over maps of the countryside where his men had been lost. It was a long stretch of the king\u2019s highway running through a piece of the Eld that had been old when Vintas was nothing more than a handful of squabbling sea kings. It was a little more than eighty miles away. We could be there in four days of hard walking.\nStapes provided me with a new travelsack, and I packed it as well as I was able. I took a few of the more practical clothes from my wardrobe, though they were still more suited for a ballroom than the road. I packed away a few items I\u2019d quietly pilfered from Caudicus\u2019 lab over the last span, and gave Stapes a list of a few essential items I was lacking, and he produced them all more quickly than a grocer in a store.\nFinally, at the hour when all but the most desperate and dishonest persons are abed, Alveron gave me a purse containing a hundred silver bits. \u201cThis is a messy way of handling it,\u201d Alveron said. \u201cNormally I would give you a writ charging citizens to provide you with assistance and aid.\u201d He sighed. \u201cBut using something like that as you travel would be as good as blowing a trumpet announcing your arrival.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cIf they\u2019re clever enough to have a spy among your guard, it\u2019s safe to assume they have connections with the local populace as well, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cThey might be the local populace,\u201d he said darkly.\nStapes led me out of the estate through the same secret passage the Maer used to enter my rooms. Carrying a hooded thief\u2019s lamp, he took me through several twisting passages, then down a long, dark stairway that bored deep into the stone of the Sheer.\nThus I found myself standing alone in the chill cellar of an abandoned shop in Severen-Low. It was in the section of the city that had been ravaged by fire some years ago, and the building\u2019s few remaining roof beams stretched like dark bones against the first pale light of dawn.\nI stepped from the burned shell of the building. Above, the Maer\u2019s estates perched on the edge of the Sheer like some predatory bird.\nI spat, none too pleased with my situation, press-ganged into mercenary service. My eyes were gritty from my sleepless night and my long journey through the twisting stone passages in the Sheer. The wine I\u2019d drunk wasn\u2019t improving anything either. For the last few hours I could feel myself growing less drunk and more hungover by slow degrees. I\u2019d never been awake", "through the entire process before, and it was not pleasant. I\u2019d managed to keep up appearances in front of Alveron and Stapes, but the fact of the matter was that my gut was sour and my thoughts were thick and sluggish.\nThe cool, predawn air cleared my head a little, and within a hundred steps I began thinking of things I\u2019d forgotten to include on the list I\u2019d given Stapes. The wine had done me no favors there. I had no tinderbox, no salt, no knife. . ..\nMy lute. I hadn\u2019t picked it up from the luthier after having its loose peg fixed. Who knew how long I might be hunting bandits for the Maer. How long would it sit unclaimed before the man decided it had been abandoned?\nI went two miles out of my way, but found the luthier\u2019s shop dark and lifeless. I hammered on the door to no avail. Then, after a moment\u2019s indecision, I broke in and stole it. Though it hardly seemed to be stealing, since the lute was mine to begin with, and I\u2019d already paid for the repairs.\nI had to climb a wall, force a window, and trip two locks. It was fairly simple stuff, but given my sleepless wine-sodden head, I\u2019m probably lucky I didn\u2019t fall off the roof and break my neck. But aside from a loose piece of slate that set my heart racing, things went smoothly and I was back on my way in twenty minutes.\nThe four mercenaries Alveron had assembled were waiting in a tavern two miles north of Severen. We made brief introductions and left immediately, heading north on the king\u2019s highway.\nMy thoughts were so sluggish that I was miles north of Severen before I began to reconsider a few things. Only then did it occur to me that the Maer might have been less than completely honest in everything he had told me the night before.\nWas I truly the best person to lead a handful of trackers into an unfamiliar forest to kill a band of highwaymen? Did the Maer really think so much of me?\nNo. Of course not. It was flattering, but simply not true. The Maer had access to better resources than that. The truth was, he probably wanted his sweet-tongued assistant out of the way now that he had the Lady Lackless well in hand. I was foolish for not realizing it sooner.\nSo he sent me on a fool\u2019s errand to get me out from underfoot. He expected me to spend a month chasing his wild goose in the deep forest of the Eld then come back empty-handed. The purse made better sense, too. A hundred bits would keep us provisioned for a month or so. Then, when I ran", "out of money I\u2019d be forced to return to Severen where the Maer would cluck his tongue in disappointment and use my failure as an excuse to ignore some of the favor I\u2019d accumulated so far.\nOn the other hand, if I got lucky and found the bandits, all the better. It was exactly the sort of plan I\u2019d credit to the Maer. No matter what happened, he got something he wanted.\nIt was irritating. But I could hardly go back to Severen and confront him. Now that I\u2019d committed myself, there was nothing to do but make the best of the situation.\nAs I walked north, my head throbbing and my mouth gritty, I decided I would surprise the Maer again. I\u2019d hunt down his bandits.\nThen third time would pay for all, and Maer Alveron would be well and truly in my debt.", "CHAPTER SEVENTY-FIVE\nThe Players\nOVER THE NEXT FEW hours of walking, I did my best to get to know the men Alveron had saddled me with. I speak figuratively, of course, as one of them was a woman, and we were all five of us afoot.\nTempi caught my eye first and held it the longest, as he was the first Adem mercenary I\u2019d ever met. Far from being the imposing, hard-eyed killer I\u2019d expected, Tempi was rather nondescript, neither particularly tall nor heavily built. He was fair-skinned with light hair and pale grey eyes. His expression was blank as fresh paper. Strangely blank. Studiously blank.\nI knew Adem mercenaries wore blood-red clothing as a sort of badge. But Tempi\u2019s outfit was different than I\u2019d expected. His shirt was held tight against his body with a dozen soft leather straps. His pants, too, were belted tightly at the thigh and calf and knee. Everything was dyed the same bright and bloody red, and it fit him snugly as a gentleman\u2019s glove.\nAs the day grew warm, I saw him begin to sweat. After living in the cool, thin air of the Stormwal, the weather must have seemed disproportionately hot to him. An hour before noon, he loosened the leather straps of his shirt and peeled it away, using it to wipe the sweat from his face and arms. He didn\u2019t seem even slightly self-conscious about walking the king\u2019s highway naked to the waist.\nTempi\u2019s skin was so pale it was almost the color of cream, and his body was lean and sleek as a coursing hound, his muscles shifting under his skin with an animal grace. I tried not to stare, but my eyes couldn\u2019t help but pick out the thin, pale scars that crossed his arms and chest and back.\nHe never offered a word of complaint about the heat. Words of any sort seemed rare from him, and he responded to most questions with a nod or a shake of the head. He carried a travelsack like mine, and his sword, far from being intimidating, seemed rather short and unimpressive.\nDedan was as different from Tempi as one man can be from another. He was tall, wide, and thick around the chest and neck. He carried a heavy", "sword, a long knife, and wore a mismatched set of boiled leather armor, hard enough to knock on and often mended. If you have ever seen a caravan guard, then you have seen Dedan, or at least someone cut from the same bolt of cloth.\nHe ate most, complained most, swore most, and had a stubborn streak thicker than a broad oak plank. But to be fair, he also had a friendly manner and an easy laugh. I was tempted to think of him as stupid due to his manners and his size, but Dedan had a quick wit when he bothered using it.\nHespe was a female mercenary. Not as rare a creature as some folk think. In appearance and equipage she was a near-mirror of Dedan. The leather, the heavy sword, the slightly weatherworn and world-wise attitude. She had broad shoulders, strong hands, and a proud face with a jaw like a cinder- brick. Her hair was blonde and fine, but cut short, in the fashion of a man\u2019s.\nBut to see her as a female version of Dedan was a mistake. She was reserved where Dedan was all bravado. And while Dedan had an easy manner when his temper wasn\u2019t up, Hespe had a vague hardness about her, as if she were constantly expecting someone to give her trouble.\nMarten was the oldest of us, our tracker. He wore a little leather, softer and better cared for than Dedan\u2019s or Hespe\u2019s. He carried a long knife, a short knife, and a hunter\u2019s bow.\nMarten had worked as a huntsman before falling out of favor with the baronet whose forests he had tended. Mercenary work was a poor job by comparison, but it kept him fed. His skill with a bow made him valuable despite the fact that he wasn\u2019t nearly as physically imposing as either Dedan or Hespe.\nThe three of them had formed a loose partnership some months ago and had been selling their services as a group ever since. Marten told me they\u2019d done other jobs for the Maer, the most recent of which involved scouting some of the lands around Tinu\u00eb.\nIt took me about ten minutes to realize Marten should be the leader of this expedition. He had more woodcraft than all the rest of us put together and had even hunted men for bounty once or twice. When I mentioned this to him, he shook his head and smiled, telling me that being able to do something and wanting to do it were two very different things indeed.\nLast was me: their fearless leader. The Maer\u2019s letter of introduction had described me as, \u201ca discerning young man of good education and diverse useful qualities.\u201d While this was perfectly true, it also made me sound like", "the most wretchedly useless court dandy in existence.\nNot helping matters was the fact that I was younger than any of them by\nyears and wearing clothes more suited for a dinner party than the road. I carried my lute and the Maer\u2019s purse. I wore no sword, no armor, no knife.\nI daresay they didn\u2019t quite know what to make of me.\nThe sun was about an hour from setting when we passed a tinker on the road. He wore the traditional brown robe, belted with a length of rope. He didn\u2019t have a cart, but led a single donkey so loaded with bundles of oddments that it looked like a mushroom.\nHe made his slow way toward us, singing:\nIf you need no mending, and nothing needs tending A wise man will still see the right time for spending. Enjoy the sunshine,\nBut though you might feel fine,\nIf you don\u2019t stop now, you\u2019ll be filled with regret. It\u2019s better to simply pay,\nAnd prepare for a rainy day\nThan think of the tinker when you\u2019re dripping wet.\nI laughed and applauded. Proper traveling tinkers are a rare breed of people, and I am always glad to see one. My mother told me they were lucky, and my father had valued them for their news. The fact that I was in desperate need of a few items made this meeting three times welcome.\n\u201cHo, Tinker,\u201d Dedan said, smiling. \u201cI need fire and a pint. How long before we hit an inn?\u201d\nThe tinker pointed back the way he had come. \u201cNot twenty minutes\u2019 walk.\u201d He eyed Dedan. \u201cBut you can\u2019t tell me there\u2019s nothing you need,\u201d he admonished. \u201cEveryone needs something.\u201d\nDedan shook his head politely. \u201cI beg your pardon, Tinker. My purse is too thin.\u201d\n\u201cHow about you?\u201d The tinker eyed me up and down. \u201cYou\u2019ve the look of a lad who\u2019s wanting something.\u201d\n \n\u201cI do need a few things,\u201d I admitted. Seeing the others look longingly down the road, I motioned them on. \u201cGo ahead,\u201d I told them. \u201cI\u2019ll be a few minutes.\u201d\nAs they headed off, the tinker rubbed his hands together, grinning. \u201cWell now, what is it you\u2019re looking for?\u201d\n\u201cSome salt to begin with.\u201d\n\u201cAnd a box to put it in,\u201d he said as he began to rummage around in his donkey\u2019s packs.\n\u201cI could use a knife too, if you have one that\u2019s not too hard to come by.\u201d\n\u201cEspecially if you\u2019re heading north,\u201d he said without missing a beat. \u201cDangerous road that way. Wouldn\u2019t do to be without a knife.\u201d\n\u201cDid you have any trouble?\u201d I asked, hoping he might know something that could help us find the bandits.\n\u201cOh no,\u201d he said as he dug through his packs. \u201cThings aren\u2019t so bad that anyone would dream of laying hands on a tinker. Still, it\u2019s a bad stretch of road.\u201d He produced a long, narrow knife in a leather sheath and handed it to me. \u201cRamston steel.\u201d\nI drew it out of its sheath, and gave the blade a close look. It was Ramston steel. \u201cI don\u2019t need anything that fine,\u201d I said, handing it back. \u201cI\u2019ll be putting it to everyday use, eating mostly.\u201d\n\u201cRamston\u2019s fine for everyday use,\u201d the tinker said pushing it back into my hands. \u201cYou can use it to trim kindling, then shave with it if you like. Keeps an edge forever.\u201d\n\u201cI might have to put it to hard use,\u201d I clarified. \u201cAnd Ramston\u2019s brittle.\u201d\n\u201cThere is that,\u201d the tinker admitted easily. \u201cAs my father always used to say, \u2018the best knife you\u2019ll ever have until it breaks.\u2019 But the same could be said of any knife. And truth be told, that\u2019s the only knife I have.\u201d\nI sighed. I know when I\u2019m being skinned. \u201cAnd a tinderbox.\u201d\nHe held one out almost before I finished saying it. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but notice you\u2019ve got a little ink about the fingers.\u201d He gestured at my hands. \u201cI\u2019ve got some paper here, good quality. Pen and ink too. Nothing worse than having an idea for a song and not being able to write it down.\u201d He held out a leather parcel of paper, pens, and ink.\nI shook my head, knowing that the Maer\u2019s purse would only stretch so far. \u201cI think I\u2019m done with song writing for a while, Tinker.\u201d\nHe shrugged, still holding it out. \u201cLetter writing then. I know a fellow who had to open a vein once to write a note to his ladylove. Dramatic, true.", "Symbolic, certainly. But also painful, unsanitary, and more than slightly macabre. Now he carries pen and ink with him wherever he goes.\u201d\nI felt the color drain from my face as the tinker\u2019s words reminded me of something else I\u2019d forgotten in my rush to leave Severen: Denna. All thought of her had been forced out of my mind by the Maer\u2019s talk of bandits, two bottles of strong wine, and a night with no sleep. I had left without a word after our terrible fight. What would she think if I spoke so cruelly to her, then simply disappeared?\nI was already a full day\u2019s journey from Severen. I couldn\u2019t go back just to tell her I was leaving, could I? I considered it for a moment. No. Besides, Denna herself had disappeared for days without a word of warning. Surely she would understand if I did the same. . . .\nStupid. Stupid. Stupid. My thoughts spun in circles as I tried to decide among my several unpleasant options.\nThe harsh hee haa of the tinker\u2019s donkey startled a thought into me. \u201cAre you headed to Severen, Tinker?\u201d\n\u201cMore through than to,\u201d he said. \u201cBut yes.\u201d\n\u201cI just remembered a letter I need to send. If I gave it to you, could you deliver it to a certain inn?\u201d\nHe nodded slowly. \u201cI could,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven that you\u2019ll be needing paper and ink. . . .\u201d He smiled, waving the package again.\nI grimaced. \u201cI will, Tinker. But how much will the lot of this cost me?\u201d\nHe looked at the accumulated items. \u201cSalt and box: four bits. Knife: fifteen bits. Paper, pens, and ink: eighteen bits. Tinderbox: three bits.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the delivery,\u201d I said.\n\u201cAn urgent delivery,\u201d the tinker said with a bit of a smile. \u201cTo a lady, unless I mistake the look on your face.\u201d\nI nodded.\n\u201cRight,\u201d he rubbed his chin. \u201cOrdinarily, I\u2019d push for about thirty-five then have a nice leisurely dicker where you bargain me down to thirty.\u201d\nThe price was reasonable, especially considering how hard it was to find good paper. Still, it was a full third of the money the Maer had given me. We would need that money for food, lodging, and other supplies.\nBut before I could say anything, the tinker continued. \u201cNow I can tell that\u2019s too much for your comfort,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I hope you don\u2019t think me too forward in saying this, but that is a rather fine cloak you\u2019re wearing. I\u2019m always willing to make a fellow a trade.\u201d", "I pulled my lovely burgundy cloak around me self-consciously. \u201cI suppose I\u2019d be willing to give it up,\u201d I said, not having to fake the regret in my voice. \u201cBut that will leave me with no cloak at all. What will I do when it rains?\u201d\n\u201cNo trouble there,\u201d the tinker said. He pulled a bundle of cloth out of a pack and held it up for me to see. It had been black once upon a time, but long use and many washings had faded it to a dark greenish color.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little tatty,\u201d I said, reaching out to finger a fraying seam.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just broken in, that\u2019s all,\u201d he said easily, spreading it across my shoulders. \u201cGood fit. Good color for you, brings out your eyes. Besides, you don\u2019t want to be looking too well-off, what with those bandits on the road.\u201d\nI sighed. \u201cWhat will you give me in trade?\u201d I asked, handing my beautiful cloak over to him. \u201cThat cloak\u2019s not a month old, mind you, and it\u2019s never even seen a drop of rain.\u201d\nThe tinker ran his hands over my beautiful cloak. \u201cIt\u2019s got all sorts of little pockets!\u201d he said admiringly. \u201cThat\u2019s just lovely!\u201d\nI fingered the thinning cloth of the tinker\u2019s cloak. \u201cIf you\u2019ll throw in needle and thread, I\u2019ll trade you my cloak for the lot of it,\u201d I said with sudden inspiration. \u201cPlus I\u2019ll give you an iron penny, a copper penny, and a silver penny.\u201d\nI grinned. It was a pittance. But that\u2019s what tinkers in stories ask for when they trade some fabulous piece of magic to an unsuspecting widow\u2019s son when he\u2019s off to make his fortune in the world.\nThe tinker threw his head back and laughed. \u201cI was about to suggest that very thing,\u201d he said. Then he tossed my cloak over his arm and shook my hand firmly.\nI fished around in my purse and handed over an iron drab, two Vintish half-pennies, and, much to my pleasant surprise, an Aturan hard penny. The last was lucky for me as it was only worth a fraction of a Vintish silver round. I emptied the dozen pockets of my burgundy cloak into my travelsack and collected my new possessions from the tinker.\nThen I wrote a quick letter to Denna, explaining that my patron had sent me away unexpectedly. I apologized for the rash things I\u2019d said, and told her I would meet with her as soon as I was back in Severen. I would have liked more time to compose it. I would have liked to give a more subtle apology, a more detailed explanation, but the tinker had finished packing away my beautiful cloak and was obviously eager to be on his way again.\nNot having any sealing wax to secure the letter, I used a trick I\u2019d invented", "while writing notes on the Maer\u2019s behalf. I folded the piece of paper against itself, then tucked it together in such a way that it would be necessary to tear the paper in order to unfold it again.\nI handed it to the tinker. \u201cIt goes to a pretty, dark-haired woman by the name of Denna. She\u2019s staying at the Four Tapers in Severen-Low.\u201d\n\u201cThat reminds me,\u201d he exclaimed as he tucked my letter into a pocket. \u201cCandles.\u201d He reached into a saddlebag and pulled out a handful of fat tallow tapers. \u201cEveryone needs candles.\u201d\nFunny thing was, I could use some, though not for the reasons he thought.\n\u201cI\u2019ve also got some rubbing wax for your boots,\u201d he continued, rooting through his bundles. \u201cWe get fierce rain this time of year.\u201d\nI held up my hands, laughing. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a bit for four candles, but I can\u2019t afford any more. If this keeps up I\u2019ll have to buy your donkey just to carry the lot with me.\u201d\n\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d he said with an easy shrug. \u201cPleasure doing business with you, young sir.\u201d", "CHAPTER SEVENTY-SIX\nTinder\nTHE SUN WAS STARTING to set by the time we found a good place to camp on the second night. Dedan went foraging for firewood. Marten began cutting up carrots and potatoes and sent Hespe to fill the cookpot with water. I used Marten\u2019s small spade to dig a pit for our fire.\nWithout being asked, Tempi picked up a branch and used his sword to shave thin strips of dry wood to use for tinder. Unsheathed, his sword still didn\u2019t seem terribly impressive. But given how easily it was peeling away paper-thin strips of wood, it must have been sharp as a shaving razor.\nI finished lining the pit with stones. Wordlessly, Tempi handed me a handful of tinder.\nI nodded. \u201cWould you like to use my knife?\u201d I asked, hoping to draw him into a bit of a conversation. I\u2019d barely shared a dozen words with him in the last two days.\nTempi\u2019s pale grey eyes looked at the knife on my belt, then back at his sword. He shook his head, fidgeting nervously.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it bad for the edge?\u201d I asked.\nThe mercenary shrugged, avoiding my eye.\nI began to lay the fire, and that was when I made my first mistake.\nAs I\u2019ve said, there was a chill in the air, and we were all of us tired. So\nrather than spend half an hour slowly nursing a spark into a decent campfire, I arranged twigs around Tempi\u2019s tinder, then stacked progressively bigger sticks around it, making a tightly packed cluster of wood.\nDedan returned with another armload of firewood just as I was finishing. \u201cLovely,\u201d he groused, quiet enough he could pretend he was just talking to himself, but loud enough so everyone could hear. \u201cAnd you\u2019re in charge. Wonderful.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s stuck in your teeth now?\u201d Marten asked, tiredly.\n\u201cBoy\u2019s making a little wooden fort, not a fire.\u201d Dedan sighed dramatically, then assumed a tone he probably thought was fatherly, but came across as", "profoundly condescending. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll help you out. A spark will never catch on that. Do you have flint and steel? I\u2019ll show you how to use them.\u201d\nNo one enjoys being talked down to, but I have a particular aversion to it. Dedan had been making it clear for two days that he thought I was an idiot.\nI gave a tired sigh. My oldest, most world-weary sigh. That was how I needed to play it. He thought of me as young and useless. I needed to drive home the point that I was nothing of the sort. \u201cDedan,\u201d I asked, \u201cwhat do you know about me?\u201d\nHe gave me a blank look.\n\u201cYou know one thing about me,\u201d I said calmly. \u201cYou know the Maer put me in charge.\u201d I looked him in the eye. \u201cIs the Maer an idiot?\u201d\nDedan made a dismissive gesture. \u201cOf course not, I was just sayin\u2019. . .\u201d\nI stood up and regretted it, as it just brought into sharp contrast how much taller he was. \u201cWould the Maer have put me in charge if I were an idiot?\u201d\nHe gave an insincere smile, trying to pass off two days\u2019 worth of derogatory muttering as some sort of misunderstanding. \u201cNow don\u2019t get all twisted up over\u2014\u201d\nI held up my hand. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault. You just don\u2019t know anything about me. But let\u2019s not waste time on it tonight. We\u2019re all tired. For now, rest assured that I\u2019m not some rich tit\u2019s son, out for a lark.\u201d\nI pinched a thin piece of Tempi\u2019s tinder between my fingers and concentrated. I pulled more heat than I needed and felt my arm go chilly all the way to the shoulder. \u201cAnd rest assured I know how to start a fire.\u201d\nThe shaved pieces of wood caught fire, flaring up hot and sudden, catching the rest of the tinder and making flames leap up almost instantly.\nI\u2019d meant it to be a dramatic gesture so Dedan would stop thinking of me as some useless boy. But the time I spent at the University had made me jaded. Starting a fire like this was as simple as putting on your boots for a member of the Arcanum.\nDedan, on the other hand, had never met an arcanist, and probably hadn\u2019t ever been within five hundred miles of the University. Everything he knew about magic was from campfire stories.\nSo when the fire flared up, he went pale as a sheet and took several sudden steps back. He looked for all the world as if I\u2019d suddenly called up a roaring sheet of fire like Taborlin the Great.\nThen I saw Marten and Hespe wearing the same expression, native Vintish superstition written clearly on their faces. Their eyes went to the flickering", "fire, then back to me. I was one of those. I meddled with dark powers. I summoned demons. I ate the entire little cheese, including the rind.\nLooking at their stunned faces, I realized nothing I said would set them at ease. Not right now. So instead I sighed and began to set up my sleeping roll for the night.\nWhile there wasn\u2019t much cheerful conversation around the fire that night, there wasn\u2019t any muttering from Dedan either. I\u2019d like respect, but failing that, a little healthy fear can go a long way to making things run smoothly.\nTwo days with no further dramatics on my part helped everyone relax. Dedan was still all bluff and bravado, but he had quit calling me \u201cboy\u201d and was only complaining about half as much, so I considered it a victory.\nFlushed with this lukewarm success, I decided to make an active attempt to draw Tempi into a conversation. If I was going to be in charge of this little group, I needed to know more about him. Most importantly, I needed to know if he could speak more than five words in a row.\nSo I approached the Adem mercenary when we stopped for our midday meal. He was sitting slightly apart from the rest of us. He wasn\u2019t standoffish. It\u2019s just that the rest of us would sit and talk while we ate. Tempi, on the other hand, simply ate.\nBut today I made a point of sitting down next to him with my lunch: a chunk of hard sausage and some cold potatoes. \u201cHello, Tempi.\u201d\nHe looked up and nodded. For a second I caught a glimpse of his pale grey eyes. Then he looked away, shifting restlessly. He ran his hand through his hair, and for a second he reminded me of Simmon. They both had the same slender build and sandy hair. Simmon wasn\u2019t this quiet though. Sometimes I could barely get a word in edgewise with Sim.\nI\u2019d tried to talk to Tempi before, of course. Ordinary small talk: the weather, sore feet after a long day\u2019s walk, the food. These had all come to nothing. At best a word or two. More often a nod or a shrug. But most common was a blank look followed by fidgeting and a stubborn refusal to do so much as look me in the eye.\nSo today I had a conversational gambit. \u201cI have heard stories about the Lethani,\u201d I said. \u201cI would like to know more. Would you tell me about it?\u201d\n \nTempi\u2019s pale eyes touched mine briefly, his expression still blank. Then he looked away again. He tugged one of the red leather straps that held his shirt close to his body and fidgeted with his sleeve. \u201cNo. I will not speak on Lethani. It is not for you. Do not ask.\u201d\nHe looked away from me again, down at the ground.\nI counted in my head. Sixteen words. That answered one of my questions at least.", "CHAPTER SEVENTY-SEVEN\nPennysworth\nTWILIGHT WAS SETTLING IN as we rounded a curve in the road. I heard clapping and stomping mingled with music, shouting, and roars of laughter. After ten hours of walking, the sound lifted my spirits to an almost cheerful level.\nLocated at the last major crossroad south of the Eld, the Pennysworth Inn was enormous. Built of rough-hewn timber, it had two full stories and a scattering of gables that hinted at a smaller, third floor above that. Through the windows I caught glimpses of men and women dancing while an unseen fiddler sawed out a mad and breathless tune.\nDedan took a deep breath. \u201cCan you smell that? I tell you, there\u2019s a woman in this place could cook a stone and make me beg for more. Sweet Peg. By these hands, I hope she\u2019s still around.\u201d He made a curving gesture, showing the double meaning of his words as he nudged Marten with an elbow.\nHespe\u2019s eyes narrowed as she stared at the back of Dedan\u2019s head.\nOblivious, Dedan continued, \u201cTonight I\u2019ll sleep with a bellyful of lamb and brandy. Although a little less sleeping might prove a little more entertaining, if my last trip here was any indication.\u201d\nI saw the storm brewing on Hespe\u2019s face and spoke up quickly. \u201cWhatever\u2019s in the pot and a bunk for each of us,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cAnything else comes out of your own pocket.\u201d\nDedan looked as if he couldn\u2019t quite believe his ears. \u201cCome off it. We\u2019ve been sleeping rough for days. Besides, \u2019taint your money, don\u2019t be a stingy shim with it.\u201d\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t done our job yet,\u201d I said calmly. \u201cNot even a piece of it. I don\u2019t know how long we may be out here, but I know I\u2019m not rich. If we run through the Maer\u2019s purse too quickly we\u2019re going to have to hunt for what we eat.\u201d I looked around at everyone. \u201cUnless someone else has enough coin to keep us fed and cares to share?\u201d\nMarten smiled ruefully at the suggestion. Hespe\u2019s eyes were for Dedan,", "who continued glowering in my direction.\nTempi fidgeted, his expression unreadable as ever. Avoiding my eyes, he\nglanced at everyone in turn, his expression blank. His eyes moved, not from face to face, but at Dedan\u2019s hands, then Dedan\u2019s feet. Then Marten\u2019s feet, then Hespe\u2019s, then mine. He shifted his weight and moved a half-step closer to Dedan.\nHoping to dispel the tension, I softened my tone and said, \u201cAfter everything is done we\u2019ll split what\u2019s left of the purse. That way each of us will have a little extra in our pocket before we even get back to Severen. We can each spend our lots as we want to. Then.\u201d\nI could tell Dedan wasn\u2019t pleased and waited to see if he would press the point.\nInstead it was Marten who spoke up. \u201cAfter a day of long walking,\u201d he said in a musing voice, as if talking to himself. \u201cA drink would go down nice.\u201d\nDedan looked to his friend, then back to me expectantly.\n\u201cI think the purse can stand a round of drinks,\u201d I conceded with a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Maer is trying to make priests of us, do you?\u201d\nThis got a throaty laugh from Hespe, while Marten and Dedan cracked smiles. Tempi glanced at me with his pale eyes, fidgeted, and looked away.\nA few minutes of relaxed haggling got the five of us common bunks, a simple supper, and a round of drinks for a single silver bit. After that was done, I found a table in a quieter corner of the room and tucked my lute out of harm\u2019s way under my bench. Then I sat down, bone weary and wondering what I could do to get Dedan to stop acting like such a little swaggercock.\nSuch was the distracted turning of my thoughts when my dinner thumped onto the table in front of me. I looked up to see a woman\u2019s face and well- advertised bosom framed by a tumble of bright red curls. Her skin was white as cream with just the barest hint of freckle. Her lips a pale, dangerous pink. Her eyes a bright, dangerous green.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, somewhat belatedly.\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, love.\u201d She smiled playfully with her eyes and brushed her hair back from her bare shoulder. \u201cIt looked like you were almost a-\n \nsleeping in your seat.\u201d\n\u201cI nearly was. A long day and a long road.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a shame indeed,\u201d she said with playful regret as she rubbed the\nback of her neck. \u201cIf I thought you\u2019d still be on your feet in an hour, I\u2019d take you off them.\u201d She reached out and twined her fingers lightly through the hair on the back of my head. \u201cThe two of us would be enough to start a fire.\u201d\nI froze like a startled deer. I cannot say why, except perhaps that I was tired from several days on the road. Perhaps it was that I\u2019d never been approached in such a forthright manner before. Perhaps\u2014\nPerhaps I was young and woefully inexperienced. Let us leave it at that.\nI scrambled desperately for something to say, but by the time I found my tongue she\u2019d taken a half step away and given me a shrewd look. I felt my face grow hot, embarrassing me further. Without thinking, I looked down at the table and the dinner she\u2019d brought. Potato soup, I thought numbly.\nShe gave a small, quiet laugh and touched my shoulder kindly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry lad. You looked like you were a little more\u2014\u201d She broke off, as if reconsidering her words, then started again. \u201cI liked the fresh look of you, but I didn\u2019t think you were that young.\u201d\nThough she spoke gently, I could hear the smile in her voice. It made my face burn even hotter, all the way to my ears. Finally, seeming to realize that anything she said would just embarrass me further, she took her hand off my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll be back to see if you need anything later.\u201d\nI nodded dumbly and watched her go. Her retreat was pleasing, but I was distracted by the sounds of scattered laughter. I looked around to see amusement on the faces of the men sitting at the long tables around me. One group raised their mugs in a silent, mocking salute. Another fellow leaned over to pat my back consolingly, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t take it personal, boy, she\u2019s turned all of us away.\u201d\nFeeling as if everyone in the room was watching me, I kept my eyes low and began to eat my dinner. As I tore off pieces of bread and dipped them in my soup, I composed a mental catalog of the extent of my idiocy. Surreptitiously, I watched the red-haired serving girl entertain and rebuff the ploys of a dozen men as she carried drinks from table to table.\nI had regained a bit of my composure by the time Marten slid into a chair next to me. \u201cYou did a good job with Dedan out there,\u201d he said without preamble.\nMy spirits lifted a bit. \u201cDid I?\u201d", "Marten nodded slightly as his sharp eyes wandered over the crowd that filled the room. \u201cMost folk try to bully him, make him feel stupid. He\u2019d have paid you back ten times the trouble if you\u2019d done it that way.\u201d\n\u201cHe was being stupid,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cAnd when you come right down to it, I did bully him.\u201d\nIt was his turn to shrug. \u201cBut you did it smart, so he\u2019ll still listen to you.\u201d He took a drink and paused, changing the subject. \u201cHespe offered to share a room with him tonight,\u201d he said casually.\n\u201cReally?\u201d I said, more than slightly surprised. \u201cShe\u2019s getting bolder.\u201d He gave a slow nod.\n\u201cAnd?\u201d I prompted.\n\u201cAnd nothing. Dedan said he\u2019d be damned before he spent money on a\nroom he should have for free.\u201d He slid his eyes to me and raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re not serious,\u201d I said flatly. \u201cHe has to know. He\u2019s just playing the\nsimpleton because he doesn\u2019t like her.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Marten said, turning toward me and lowering his voice a\nbit. \u201cThree span ago we finished a caravan job from Ralien. It was a long haul, and Dedan and me had a pocket full of coin and nothing in particular to do with it, so by the end of the night we\u2019re sitting in this grubby little dockside tavern, too drunk to stand up and leave. And he starts talking about her.\u201d\nMarten shook his head slowly. \u201cHe went on for an hour, and you wouldn\u2019t have recognized the woman he was describing as our hard-eyed Hespe. He practically sang about her.\u201d He sighed. \u201cHe thinks she\u2019s too good for him. And he\u2019s convinced if he so much as looked at her sideways he\u2019d end up with his arm broken in three places.\u201d\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell him?\u201d\n\u201cTell him what? That was before she started going all cow-eyed over him. I thought his worries were fairly sensible at the time. What do you think Hespe would do to you if you were to give her a friendly pat on any of her friendlier parts?\u201d\nI looked over to where Hespe stood at the bar. One foot tapped roughly in time to the rhythm of the fiddle. Other than that, the set of her shoulders, her eyes, the line of her jaw were all hard, almost belligerent. There was a small but noticeable gap between her and the men standing on either side of her at the bar.\n\u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t risk my arm either,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut he has to know", "by now. He isn\u2019t blind.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s no worse off than the rest of us.\u201d\nI started to protest, then glanced at the red-haired serving girl. \u201cWe could\ntell him,\u201d I said. \u201cYou could. He trusts you.\u201d\nMarten sucked at his teeth with his tongue. \u201cNah,\u201d he said, setting his\ndrink down firmly. \u201cIt would just make things muddier. Either he\u2019ll see it or he won\u2019t. In his own time, in his own way.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cOr not, and the sun will still rise in the morning.\u201d\nNeither of us spoke for a long while. Marten watched the buzzing room over the top of his mug, his eyes growing distant. I let the noise of the place fade to a low comforting purr as I leaned against the wall, drowsing.\nAnd as my thoughts untended tend to do, they wandered to Denna. I thought about the smell of her, the arch of her neck near her ear, the way her hands moved when she talked. I wondered where she was tonight, if she was well. I wondered just a bit if her thoughts ever wandered into warm musings of me. . . .\n\u201c. . . hunting bandits shouldn\u2019t be hard. Besides, it\u2019ll be nice to get the jump on them for a change, lawless damn ravel bastards.\u201d\nThe words drew me out of my warm drowse like a fish yanked from a pool. The fiddler had stopped playing to have a drink, and in the relative quiet of the room Dedan\u2019s voice was loud as a donkey\u2019s bray. I opened my eyes and saw Marten was looking around in mild alarm too, no doubt roused by the same words that had caught my ear.\nIt only took me a second to spot Dedan. He was sitting two tables away, having a drunken conversation with a grey-haired farmer.\nMarten was already getting to his feet. Not wanting to draw attention to the situation, I hissed, \u201cGet him,\u201d and forced myself back into my seat.\nI gritted my teeth as Marten threaded quickly through the tables, tapped Dedan on the shoulder, and jerked a thumb toward the table where I sat. Dedan grumbled something I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t hear and grudgingly pushed himself to his feet.\nI forced my eyes to wander around the room rather than follow Dedan. Tempi was easy to spot in his mercenary reds. He was facing the hearth,\n \nwatching the fiddler tune his instrument. There were several empty glasses on the table in front of him, and he had loosened the leather straps of his shirt. He eyed the fiddler with a strange intensity.\nAs I watched, a serving girl brought him another drink. He looked her over, his pale eyes moving pointedly up and down her body. She said something, and he kissed the back of her hand as smoothly as a courtier. She blushed and pushed at his shoulder playfully. One of his hands moved smoothly to the curve of her waist and rested there. She didn\u2019t seem to mind.\nDedan stepped close to my table, eclipsing my view of Tempi just as the fiddler lifted his bow and began to saw out a jig. A dozen people came to their feet, eager to dance.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Dedan demanded as he came to stand in front of my table. \u201cHave ye called me over here to tell me it\u2019s gettin\u2019 late? That I\u2019ve got a busy day tomorrow and I should tuck my little self into bed?\u201d He leaned forward onto the table, putting his eyes more on level with mine. I caught a sour smell on his breath: dreg. A cheap, repulsive liquor you can start fires with.\nI laughed dismissively. \u201cHell, I\u2019m not your mum.\u201d Actually I had been about to say that very thing and scrambled mentally for something else to distract him with. My eye lighted on the redhead that had served me my dinner earlier that evening, and I leaned forward in my seat. \u201cI was wondering if you could tell me something,\u201d I said in my best conspiratorial tone.\nHis scowl gave way to curiosity, and I lowered my voice a little more. \u201cYou\u2019ve been here before, right?\u201d He nodded, leaning a little closer. \u201cDo you know what that girl\u2019s name is?\u201d I nodded my head in the redhead\u2019s direction.\nDedan took an over-careful look over his shoulder that surely would have drawn her attention if she hadn\u2019t been facing away from us. \u201cThe blonde one the Adem\u2019s pawin\u2019 at?\u201d Dedan asked.\n\u201cRedhead.\u201d\nDedan\u2019s broad forehead wrinkled as he squinted the far side of the room into focus. \u201cLosine?\u201d He asked softly. He turned to me, still squinting. \u201cLittle Losi?\u201d\nI shrugged and began to regret my choice of diversionary tactic.\nAn explosive laugh burst out of the big man and he half fell, half slid onto the bench across from me.\n\u201cLosi,\u201d he chuckled a little more loudly than I liked. \u201cKvothe, I had you all wrong.\u201d He slapped the table with the flat of his hand and laughed again,", "nearly tipping himself over backward on the bench. \u201cAh, you\u2019ve got a good eye, boy, but you haven\u2019t got a damn chance.\u201d\nMy battered pride pricked up at this. \u201cWhy not? Isn\u2019t she, well\u2014\u201d I trailed off, making an inarticulate gesture.\nHe somehow managed to gather my meaning. \u201cA whore?\u201d he asked incredulously. \u201cGod boy, no. There\u2019s a couple around.\u201d He made a sweeping gesture over his head, then lowered his voice to a more private level. \u201cNot really whores, mind you. Just girls who don\u2019t mind a little extra at night.\u201d He paused, blinked. \u201cMoney. Extra money. And extra other things.\u201d He chortled.\n\u201cI just thought . . .\u201d I began weakly.\n\u201cAy, any man who ever had eyes and balls thought that.\u201d He leaned a little closer. \u201cShe\u2019s a lusty little one. She\u2019ll trip a man who catches her eye, but she can\u2019t be talked or bought into bed. If she could, she\u2019d be rich as the king of Vint.\u201d He looked in her direction. \u201cHow much\u2019s a roll with that worth? I\u2019d give\u2014\u201d\nHe squinted in her direction, his lips moving as if going through some silent, complex arithmetic. After a moment he shrugged. \u201cMore than I\u2019ve got.\u201d He looked back to me, shrugged again. \u201cStill, it\u2019s no good wishing. Save yourself the trouble. If ye want, I know a lady here who\u2019s no shame to look at. Might be willing to brighten up your evening.\u201d He started to look around the room.\n\u201cNo!\u201d I put my hand on his arm to stop him. \u201cI was just curious, that\u2019s all.\u201d I sounded insincere and I knew it. \u201cThanks for filling me in.\u201d\n\u201cNothin\u2019 to it.\u201d He carefully got to his feet.\n\u201cOh,\u201d I said, as if a thought had just occurred to me. \u201cCould you do me a favor?\u201d He nodded and I gestured him closer. \u201cI\u2019m worried Hespe might end up talking about our job for the Maer. If the bandits hear we\u2019re hunting them, things will get ten times harder.\u201d A guilty look flashed across his face. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure she wouldn\u2019t mention it, but you know how women like to talk.\u201d\n\u201cI understand,\u201d he said quickly as he stood up. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to her. Better to be careful.\u201d\nThe hawk-faced fiddler finished his jig, and everyone clapped and stomped and pounded empty mugs on their tables. I sighed and rubbed my face into my hands. When I looked up I saw Marten at the table next to mine. He touched his fingers to his forehead and nodded a small salute. I gave a slight, seated bow. It\u2019s always nice to have an appreciative audience.", "CHAPTER SEVENTY-EIGHT\nAnother Road, Another Forest\nI TOOK A CERTAIN DARK pleasure in seeing a rather hungover Dedan on the road before the sun was fully in the sky the next morning. The large man carried himself delicately, but to give him due credit, he didn\u2019t offer a word of complaint, unless the occasional low moan can be counted as a word.\nNow that I was watching more closely, I spotted the marks of infatuation on Dedan. The way he said Hespe\u2019s name. The coarse jokes he made when talking to her. Every few minutes he would find an excuse to glance in her direction. Always under some pretext: a stretch, an idle glance at the road, a gesture to the trees around us.\nDespite this, Dedan remained oblivious to the sporadic courtship Hespe was paying him in return. At times it was amusing to watch, like a well- orchestrated Modegan tragedy. At times I wanted to strangle them both.\nTempi traveled wordlessly among us like a mute, well-behaved puppy. He watched everything: the trees, the road, the clouds. If it weren\u2019t for the unquestionably intelligent look in his eyes, I\u2019d have thought him a simpleton by this point. The few questions I put to him were still met with awkward fidgeting, nods, shrugs, or shakes of the head.\nAll the while my curiosity nagged at me. I knew the Lethani was just a piece of storybook nonsense, but part of me couldn\u2019t help but wonder. Was he really saving his words? Could he really use his quiet like armor? Move fast as a snake? The truth was, after catching glimpses of what Elxa Dal and Fela could do by calling on the names of fire and stone, the thought of someone storing up words to burn as fuel didn\u2019t seem nearly as foolish as it used to.\nThe five of us got to know each other in dribs and drabs, growing familiar\n \nwith each other\u2019s quirks. Dedan carefully groomed the ground where he lay his bedroll, not just removing twigs and stones, but stomping flat every tuft of grass or lump of dirt.\nHespe whistled tunelessly when she thought no one was listening and picked her teeth methodically after every meal. Marten wouldn\u2019t eat meat that had the barest bit of pink to it or drink water that hadn\u2019t been boiled or mixed with wine. He told the rest of us at least twice a day that we were fools for not doing the same.\nBut in terms of odd behavior, Tempi was the prize winner of the lot. He wouldn\u2019t look me in the eye. Didn\u2019t smile. Didn\u2019t frown. Didn\u2019t speak.\nSince we left the Pennysworth, he had made only one comment of his own free will. \u201cRain would make this road another road, this forest another forest.\u201d He said each word distinctly, as if he had been deliberating on the statement all day. For all I knew, he had.\nHe washed himself obsessively. The rest of us would take advantage of a bathhouse when we stopped at an inn, but Tempi bathed every day. If there was a stream handy, he would bathe both at night and then again when he woke. Otherwise, he would wash himself using a cloth and some of his drinking water.\nAnd twice a day without fail, he performed an elaborate ritual stretch, his hands making careful shapes and patterns in the air. It reminded me of the slow court dances they perform in Modeg.\nIt obviously kept him limber, but it was strange to watch. Hespe made jokes about how if the bandits asked us to dance, our sweet-smelling mercenary would be a wonderful help. But she said it quietly, when Tempi was out of earshot.\nIn terms of quirks, I suppose I was in no position to throw stones. I played my lute most evenings, when I wasn\u2019t too weary from walking. I daresay it didn\u2019t improve the others\u2019 opinion of me as a tactical leader or arcanist.\nAs we neared our destination, I grew increasingly anxious. Marten was the only one of us truly suited to this work. Dedan and Hespe would be good in a fight, but they were troublesome to work with. Dedan was argumentative and stubborn. Hespe was lazy. She rarely helped prepare meals or clean up afterward unless she was asked, and even then her help was so grudging it was barely any help at all.\nAnd then there was Tempi, a hired killer who wouldn\u2019t look me in the eye or hold a conversation. A mercenary I firmly believed could look forward to", "a decent career in the Modegan theater. . . .\nFive days after leaving Severen, we came to the area where the attacks had been made. A twenty-mile stretch of twisting road that ran through the Eld: no towns, no inns, not even an abandoned farm. An utterly isolated stretch of the king\u2019s highway in the middle of an endless ancient wood. The natural habitat of bears, mad hermits, and poachers. A highwayman\u2019s paradise.\nMarten went scouting while the rest of us set up camp. An hour later he emerged from the trees, winded but in good spirits. He reassured us he hadn\u2019t found sign of anyone else nearby.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m defending tax collectors,\u201d Dedan muttered disgustedly. Hespe gave a throaty laugh.\n\u201cYou\u2019re defending civilization,\u201d I corrected. \u201cAnd you\u2019re keeping the roads safe. Besides, Maer Alveron does important things with those taxes.\u201d I grinned. \u201cLike pay us.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m fighting for,\u201d Marten said.\nAfter dinner, I outlined the only strategy I\u2019d been able to come up with in five long days of thinking. I drew a curving line on the ground with a stick. \u201cOkay. Here\u2019s the road, about twenty miles of it.\u201d\n\u201cMieles.\u201d The soft voice was Tempi\u2019s.\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d I asked. This was the first thing I had heard him say in a day and a half.\n\u201cMiils?\u201d His accent was so thick around the unfamiliar word that it took me a second to understand he was saying \u201cmiles.\u201d\n\u201cMiles.\u201d I said distinctly. I pointed in the direction of the road and held up one finger. \u201cFrom here to the road is one mile. Today we walked fifteen miles.\u201d\nHe nodded once.\nI turned back to my drawing. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to assume the bandits are within ten miles of the road.\u201d I drew a box around my crude sketch of the road. \u201cThat gives us four hundred square miles of forest to search.\u201d\nThere was a moment of silence as everyone absorbed that piece of information. Finally, Tempi spoke, \u201cThat is large.\u201d\nI nodded seriously. \u201cIt would take us months to search that much territory,\n \nbut we shouldn\u2019t have to.\u201d I added a couple more lines to my drawing. \u201cEvery day Marten will scout ahead for us.\u201d I looked up to him. \u201cHow much ground can you safely cover in a day?\u201d\nHe thought for a second, looking around at the trees surrounding us. \u201cThis forest? With this much underscrub? About a square mile.\u201d\n\u201cHow many if you\u2019re being careful?\u201d\nHe smiled. \u201cI\u2019m always careful.\u201d\nI nodded and drew a line parallel to the road. \u201cMarten will scout a strip\nabout a half mile wide, about a mile back from the road. He\u2019ll keep an eye out for their camp or their sentries so the rest of us don\u2019t stumble into them accidentally.\u201d\nHespe shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s no good. They won\u2019t be that close to the road. If they\u2019re looking to stay hid, they\u2019ll be farther back. At least two or three miles.\u201d\nDedan nodded. \u201cI\u2019d make sure I was at least four miles from the road before I hunkered down and made a habit of killing folk.\u201d\n\u201cI think so too,\u201d I agreed. \u201cBut they have to make their way to the road sooner or later. They have to post lookouts and travel back and forth for ambushes. They need to reprovision themselves. Since they\u2019ve been here several months, odds are they\u2019ve worn some sort of trail.\u201d\nI added a little detail to my dirt map with my stick. \u201cAfter Marten has scouted, two of us will go in and make a careful search behind him. We\u2019ll cover a thin strip of forest, searching it for any sign of their trail. The other two will keep an eye on the camp.\n\u201cWe can cover about two miles a day. We\u2019ll start on the north side of the road and search from west to east. If we don\u2019t find a trail, we\u2019ll cross to the south side of the road and work our way back from east to west.\u201d I finished drawing in the dirt and stood back. \u201cWe\u2019ll find their trail in a span of days. Maybe two, depending on our luck.\u201d I leaned back and drove my stick into the ground.\nDedan stared bleakly at the rough map. \u201cWe\u2019ll need more supplies.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll move camp every fifth day. Two of us will walk back to Crosson to get supplies. The other two will move the camp. Marten will rest.\u201d\nMarten spoke up. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to be careful with our fires from now on, too,\u201d he said. \u201cThe smell of smoke will give us away if we\u2019re upwind of them.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll need a fire pit every night, and we\u2019ll want to keep an eye", "out for rennel trees.\u201d I looked at Marten. \u201cYou know what a rennel looks like, don\u2019t you?\u201d His expression was surprised.\nHespe looked back and forth between us. \u201cWhat\u2019s rennel?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tree,\u201d Marten said. \u201cGood for firewood. It burns clean and hot. No smoke to speak of, and hardly any stink of smoke either.\u201d\n\u201cEven when the wood is green,\u201d I said. \u201cSame with the leaves. It\u2019s useful stuff. It doesn\u2019t grow everywhere, but I\u2019ve seen some around.\u201d\n\u201cHow does a city boy like you know something like that?\u201d Dedan asked.\n\u201cKnowing things is what I do,\u201d I said seriously. \u201cAnd what in the world makes you think I grew up in a city?\u201d\nDedan shrugged, looking away.\n\u201cThat should be the only wood we burn from here on out,\u201d I said. \u201cIf it\u2019s in short supply, we\u2019ll save it for a cookfire. If we don\u2019t have any, we\u2019ll have to eat cold. So keep an eye out.\u201d\nEveryone nodded, Tempi slightly later than the rest.\n\u201cLastly, we\u2019d better have our stories straight in case they stumble onto us while we\u2019re looking for them.\u201d I pointed to Marten. \u201cWhat are you going to say if someone catches you while you\u2019re out scouting?\u201d\nHe looked surprised, but hardly hesitated in his response. \u201cI\u2019m a poacher.\u201d He pointed to his unstrung bow leaning against a tree. \u201cIt won\u2019t be far from the truth.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re from?\u201d\nThere was a flicker of hesitation. \u201cCrosson, just a day west of here.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your name is?\u201d\n\u201cM-Meris,\u201d he said awkwardly. Dedan laughed.\nI cracked a smile. \u201cDon\u2019t lie about your name. It\u2019s hard to do convincingly.\nIf they catch you and let you go, fine. Just don\u2019t lead them back to our camp. If they want to take you back with them, make the best of it. Pretend you\u2019d like to join up. Don\u2019t try to run.\u201d\nMarten looked uneasy. \u201cI just stay with them?\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cThey\u2019ll expect you to run on the first night if they think you\u2019re stupid. If they think you\u2019re clever, they\u2019ll expect you to run on the second night. But by the third night they should trust you a bit. Wait until midnight, then start some sort of disturbance. Light a couple of tents on fire or something. We\u2019ll be waiting for the confusion and take them apart from the outside.\u201d\nI looked around at the other three. \u201cThe plan is the same for any of you.", "Wait until the third night.\u201d\n\u201cHow will you find their camp?\u201d Marten asked, a thin layer of sweat on his\nforehead. I didn\u2019t blame him., This was a dangerous game we were playing. \u201cIf they catch me, I won\u2019t be there to help track you down.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t be finding them,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll be finding you. I can find any of you in the forest.\u201d\nI looked around the fire, expecting at least a grumble from Dedan, but none of them seemed to doubt my arcane abilities. Idly, I wondered how much they thought I was capable of.\nThe truth was I\u2019d surreptitiously collected a hair from each of them in the last few days. So I could easily could create a makeshift dowsing pendulum for anyone in the group in less than a minute. Given Vintish superstition, I doubted they\u2019d be happy knowing the specific details.\n\u201cWhat should our stories be?\u201d Hespe tapped Dedan on the chest with the back of her hand, her knuckles making a hollow noise on his hard leather vest.\n\u201cDo you think you could convince them you were disgruntled caravan guards who had decided to turn bandit?\u201d\nDedan snorted. \u201cHell, I\u2019ve thought about it once or twice.\u201d At a look from Hespe he snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you haven\u2019t done the same. Span after span of walking in the rain, eating beans, sleeping on the ground. All for penny a day?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cGod\u2019s teeth. I\u2019m surprised half of us don\u2019t take to the trees.\u201d\nI smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll do just fine.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about him?\u201d Hespe jerked her thumb at Tempi. \u201cNobody is going to believe he\u2019s gone wild. Adem make ten times what we do for a day\u2019s work.\u201d\n\u201cTwenty times,\u201d Dedan grumbled.\nI\u2019d been thinking the same thing. \u201cTempi, what will you do if you are found by the bandits?\u201d\nTempi fidgeted a little, but didn\u2019t say anything. He looked at me briefly, then broke eye contact, glancing down and to the side. I couldn\u2019t tell if he was thinking, or merely confused.\n\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for his Adem reds, he wouldn\u2019t look like anything special,\u201d Marten said. \u201cEven the sword doesn\u2019t look like much.\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like twenty times as much as me, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Dedan\u2019s voice was low, but not so low that everyone couldn\u2019t hear.\nI was worried about Tempi\u2019s outfit too. I\u2019d tried to draw the Adem into a", "conversation several times with the hope of discussing the problem with him, but it was like trying to have a chat with a cat.\nBut the fact that he hadn\u2019t known the word \u201cmiles\u201d made me realize something I should have thought of long before. Aturan wasn\u2019t his native language. Having recently struggled to make myself fluent in Siaru at the University, I could understand the impulse to keep quiet rather than speak and make a fool of myself.\n\u201cHe could try to play along, same as us,\u201d Hespe said dubiously.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to lie convincingly when you\u2019re not good with the language,\u201d I said.\nTempi\u2019s pale eyes darted to each of us as we spoke, but he didn\u2019t offer any comment.\n\u201cFolk underestimate a person who can\u2019t speak well,\u201d Hespe said. \u201cMaybe he could sort of just . . . play dumb? Act confused like he was lost?\u201d\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t have to play dumb,\u201d Dedan continued under his breath. \u201cCould just be dumb.\u201d\nTempi looked at Dedan, still expressionless, but with more intensity than before. He drew a slow, deliberate breath before speaking. \u201cQuiet is not stupid,\u201d he said, his voice flat. \u201cYou? Always talk. Chek chek chek chek chek.\u201d He made a motion with one hand, like a mouth opening and closing. \u201cAlways. Like dog all night barking at tree. Try to be big. No. Just noise. Just dog.\u201d\nI shouldn\u2019t have laughed, but it caught me completely off guard. Partly because I thought of Tempi as so quiet and passive, and partly because he was absolutely right. If Dedan were a dog, he would be a dog that barked endlessly at nothing. Barking just to hear himself bark.\nStill, I shouldn\u2019t have laughed. But I did. Hespe laughed too and tried to hide it, which was worse.\nDedan\u2019s face went dark with anger and he got to his feet. \u201cYou come here and say that.\u201d\nStill expressionless, Tempi stood and walked around the fire until he stood next to Dedan. Well . . . if I say he stood next to him, you will take the wrong impression. Most people stand two or three feet away when talking to you. But Tempi walked until he was less than a foot away from Dedan. To get any closer, he would have had to give him a hug or climb him.\nI could lie and say this happened too quickly for me to intervene, but that wouldn\u2019t be true. The simple truth was that I couldn\u2019t think of an easy way to", "break up the situation. But the more complicated truth was that I was pretty fed up with Dedan myself by this point.\nWhat\u2019s more, this was the most I\u2019d ever heard Tempi speak. For the first time since I\u2019d met him, he was behaving like a person, not just some mute, ambulatory doll.\nAnd I was curious to see him fight. I\u2019d heard a lot about the legendary Adem prowess, and I was hoping to see it thump some of the sullen mutter out of Dedan\u2019s thick head.\nTempi walked up to Dedan, standing close enough to put his arms around him. Dedan stood a full head taller, broader across the shoulders, and thicker in the chest. Tempi looked up at him without a trace of anything you might expect to see on his face. No bravado. No mocking smile. Nothing.\n\u201cJust dog,\u201d Tempi said softly, with no particular inflection. \u201cBig noise dog.\u201d He lifted up his hand and made a mouth of it again. \u201cChek. Chek. Chek.\u201d\nDedan lifted a hand and shoved hard against Tempi\u2019s chest. I\u2019d seen this sort of thing countless times in the taverns near the University. It was the sort of shove that sends a man staggering backward, off balance and prone to stagger and trip.\nExcept Tempi didn\u2019t stagger. He just . . . stepped away. Then he reached out casually and cuffed Dedan along one side of his head, the way a parent might swat an unruly child in the market. It wasn\u2019t even hard enough to move Dedan\u2019s head, but we could all hear a soft paff sound, and Dedan\u2019s hair puffed out like a milkweed pod someone had blown against.\nDedan stood still for a moment, as if he couldn\u2019t quite understand what had happened. Then he frowned and brought both hands up to give Tempi a more violent shove. Tempi stepped away from this too, then swatted Dedan on the other side of his head.\nDedan scowled, grunted, and brought his hands up, making fists. He was a big man, and his mercenary leathers creaked and strained at the shoulders as he lifted his arms. He waited a moment, obviously hoping Tempi would make the first move, then he stomped forward, drew his arm back, and threw a punch, hard and heavy as a farmhand swinging an axe.\nTempi saw it coming and stepped away a third time. But halfway through his clumsy swing, everything about Dedan changed. He raised himself up on the balls of his feet and his ponderous haymaker punch evaporated. Suddenly, he no longer looked like a lumbering bull, and instead, he darted forward and", "snapped out three quick punches, fast as a bird\u2019s wing flapping.\nTempi sidestepped one, slapped the other aside, but the third caught him\nhigh on the shoulder, spinning him partway around and knocking him backward. He took two quick steps out of Dedan\u2019s reach, regained his balance, and shook himself slightly. Then he laughed, high and delighted.\nThe sound softened the expression on Dedan\u2019s face, and he grinned in return, though he didn\u2019t lower his hands or move off the balls of his feet. Despite this, Tempi stepped up, avoided another jab, and struck Dedan in the face with the flat of his hand. Not across the cheek, as if they were squabbling lovers onstage. Tempi\u2019s hand came down from above and struck Dedan across the front of his face, from his forehead down to his chin.\n\u201cArrhhgh!\u201d Dedan shouted. \u201cBlack damn!\u201d He staggered away, clutching at his nose. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Did you just slap me?\u201d He peered out at Tempi from behind his hand. \u201cYou fight like a woman.\u201d\nFor a moment, Tempi looked as if he might object. Then he gave the first smile I had ever seen from him and gave a small nod and shrug instead. \u201cYes. I fight like a woman.\u201d\nDedan hesitated, then laughed and clapped Tempi roughly on the shoulder. I half expected Tempi to dart away from his touch, but instead the Adem returned the gesture, even to the point of gripping Dedan\u2019s shoulder and jostling him around playfully.\nThe display struck me as odd coming from someone who had been so reserved over the last several days, but I decided not to look a gift horse in the mouth. Anything other than fidgety silence from the Adem was a blessing.\nEven better, I now had a measure of Tempi\u2019s fighting ability. Whether or not Dedan wanted to admit it, Tempi obviously had the better of him. I guessed the Adem reputation was more than just empty air.\nMarten watched Tempi return to his seat. \u201cThose clothes are still a problem,\u201d the woodsman said, as if nothing much had happened. He eyed Tempi\u2019s blood-red shirt and pants. \u201cMight as well run around waving a flag as wear that in the trees.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll talk with him about it,\u201d I told the others. If Tempi was self-conscious about his Aturan, I guessed our conversation would go more smoothly without an audience. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll work out what he\u2019ll do if he runs into them. You three can go settle in and get dinner started.\u201d\nThe three of them scattered off, looking to claim the prime places for their", "bedrolls. Tempi watched them go, then turned back to look at me. He glanced down at the ground and took a small, shuffling step away.\n\u201cTempi?\u201d\nHe cocked his head and looked at me.\n\u201cWe need to talk about your clothing.\u201d\nIt happened again as soon as I started to talk. His attention slowly slid\naway from me, his eyes drifting down and to the side. As if he couldn\u2019t be bothered to actually listen. As if he were a sulky child.\nI don\u2019t need to tell you how infuriating it is to try and have a discussion with a person who won\u2019t look you in the eye. Still, I didn\u2019t have the luxury of taking offense or putting off this talk. I\u2019d already delayed this conversation too long.\n\u201cTempi.\u201d I fought the urge to snap my fingers in order to draw his attention back to me. \u201cYour clothes are red,\u201d I said, trying to keep it as simple as possible. \u201cEasy to see. Dangerous.\u201d\nHe gave no response for a long moment. Then his pale eyes darted up to mine and he nodded, a simple bob of the head.\nI began to have a horrible suspicion that he might not actually understand what it was we were doing out here in the Eld. \u201cTempi, you know what we are doing out here, in the forest?\u201d\nTempi\u2019s eyes moved to my rough sketch in the dirt, then back up at me. He shrugged and made a vague gesture with both hands. \u201cWhat is many but not all?\u201d\nAt first I thought he was asking some strange philosophical question, then I realized he was asking for a word. I held up my hand and grabbed two of my fingers. \u201cSome?\u201d I grabbed three fingers. \u201cMost?\u201d\nTempi watched my hands intently, nodding. \u201cMost,\u201d he said, fidgeting. \u201cI know most. Talk is fast.\u201d\n\u201cWe are looking for men.\u201d His eyes slid away as soon as I started to speak, and I fought the urge to sigh. \u201cWe are trying to find men.\u201d\nNod. \u201cYes. Hunt men.\u201d He stressed the word. \u201cHunt visantha.\u201d\nAt least he knew why we were here. \u201cRed?\u201d I reached out and touched the red leather strap that held the fabric of his shirt tight to his body. It was surprisingly soft. \u201cFor hunting? Do you have other clothes? Not red?\u201d\nTempi looked down at his outfit, fidgeting. Then he nodded and went over to his pack and drew out a shirt of plain grey homespun. He held it up for me. \u201cFor hunting. But not fighting.\u201d", "I wasn\u2019t sure what his distinction meant, but I was willing to let it go for now. \u201cWhat will you do if visantha find you in the forest?\u201d I asked. \u201cTalk or fight?\u201d\nHe seemed to think about it for a moment. \u201cNot good at talk,\u201d he admitted. \u201cVisantha? Fight.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cOne bandit, fight. Two, talk.\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cCan fight two.\u201d\n\u201cFight and win?\u201d\nHe gave another nonchalant shrug and pointed to where Dedan was\ncarefully picking twigs out of the sod. \u201cLike him? Three or four.\u201d He held out his hand, palm up, as if offering me something. \u201cIf three bandit, I fight. If four, I try best talk. I wait until three night. Then . . .\u201d he made an odd, elaborate gesture with both hands. \u201cFire in tents.\u201d\nI relaxed, glad he had followed our earlier discussion. \u201cYes. Good. Thank you.\u201d\nThe five of us had a quiet dinner of soup, bread, and a rather unimpressive gummy cheese we\u2019d bought in Crosson. Dedan and Hespe bickered in a friendly way, and I speculated with Marten about what sort of weather we might expect over the next few days.\nOther than that, there wasn\u2019t much chatter. Two of us had already come to blows. We\u2019d come a hundred miles since Severen, and we were all aware of the grim work ahead of us.\n\u201cHold on,\u201d Marten said. \u201cWhat if they catch you?\u201d He looked up at me. \u201cWe all have a plan if the bandits find us. We head back with them and you\u2019ll track us down on the third day.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget the distraction.\u201d\nMarten looked anxious. \u201cBut what if they catch you? I don\u2019t have any magic. I can\u2019t guarantee I\u2019ll be able to track them down by that third night. Probably, sure. But tracking isn\u2019t a certain thing. . . .\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just a harmless musician,\u201d I reassured him. \u201cI got in some trouble with the Baronet Banbride\u2019s niece and thought it would be best if I legged it into the forest for a while.\u201d I grinned. \u201cThey might rob me, but as I don\u2019t have much, they\u2019ll probably just let me go. I\u2019m a persuasive fellow, and I don\u2019t look like much of a threat.\u201d\nDedan muttered something under his breath I was glad I couldn\u2019t hear.\n\u201cBut what if?\u201d Hespe pressed. \u201cMarten\u2019s got a point. What if they take you back with them?\u201d", "That was something I hadn\u2019t figured out yet, but rather than end the evening on a sour note, I smiled my most confident smile. \u201cIf they take me back to their camp, I should be able to kill them off myself without much trouble.\u201d I shrugged with exaggerated nonchalance. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you back at camp after the job is done.\u201d I thumped the ground beside me, grinning.\nI had intended it as a joke, sure Marten at least would chuckle at my flippant response. But I\u2019d underestimated how deep Vintic superstition tends to run, and my comment was met with an uncomfortable silence.\nThere was little conversation after that. We drew lots for the watch, doused the fire, and one by one we drifted off to sleep.", "CHAPTER SEVENTY-NINE\nSigns\nAFTER BREAKFAST, MARTEN BEGAN teaching Tempi and me how to search for the bandits\u2019 trail.\nAnyone can spot a piece of torn shirt hanging from a branch or a footprint gouged into the dirt, but those things never happen in real life. They make for convenient plot devices in plays, but really, when have you ever torn your clothing so seriously that you\u2019ve left a piece of it behind?\nNever. The people we were hunting were clever, so we couldn\u2019t count on them making any obvious mistakes. That meant Marten was the only one among us who had any idea what we were really looking for.\n\u201cAny broken twig,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll mostly be where things are thick and tangled: waist high or ankle high.\u201d He gestured as if kicking through thick scrub and pushing things aside with his hands. \u201cSeeing the actual break is hard, so look at the leaves instead.\u201d He gestured to a nearby bush. \u201cWhat do you see there?\u201d\nTempi pointed at a lower branch. He wore his plain grey homespun today, and without his mercenary reds, he looked even less imposing.\nI looked where Tempi was pointing and saw the branch had been snapped, but not badly enough to break off.\n\u201cSo someone has been through here?\u201d I asked\nMarten shrugged his bow higher up on his shoulder. \u201cI was. I did this last night.\u201d He looked at us. \u201cSee how even the leaves that aren\u2019t hanging strange are starting to wilt?\nI nodded.\n\u201cThat means someone has been by this way within a day or so. If it\u2019s been two or three days, the leaves will brown out and die. You see both close to each other . . .\u201d He looked at me.\n\u201cIt means you have someone moving through the area more than once, days apart.\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cSince I\u2019m scouting and keeping an eye out for bandits, you\u2019ll", "be the ones with your noses to the ground. When you find something like this, call me.\u201d\n\u201cCall?\u201d Tempi cupped his hands around his mouth and turned his head in different directions. He made a wide gesture to the surrounding trees and put his hand to his ear, pretending to listen.\nMarten frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re right. You can\u2019t just go shouting for me.\u201d He rubbed the back of his neck in frustration. \u201cDamn, we didn\u2019t think this all the way through.\u201d\nI smiled at him. \u201cI thought it through,\u201d I said, and brought out a rough wooden whistle I\u2019d carved last night. It only had two notes, but that was all we needed. I put it to my mouth and blew. Ta-ta DEE. Ta-ta DEE.\nMarten grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s a Will\u2019s Widow, isn\u2019t it? The pitch is dead on.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s what I do.\u201d\nHe cleared his throat. \u201cUnfortunately, Will\u2019s Widow is also called a night-\njar.\u201d He grimaced apologetically. \u201cNight-jar, mind you. That\u2019ll catch at the ear of any experienced woodsman like a fishhook if you go blowing it every time you want me to come take a look at something.\u201d\nI looked down at the whistle. \u201cBlack hands,\u201d I swore. \u201cI should have thought of that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good idea,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just need one for a daytime bird. Maybe a gold piper.\u201d He whistled two notes. \u201cThat should be simple enough.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll carve a different one tonight,\u201d I said, then reached down for a twig. I snapped it and handed half to Marten. \u201cThis will do if I need to signal you today.\u201d\nHe looked at the stick oddly. \u201cHow exactly will this help?\u201d\n\u201cWhen we need your opinion on something we\u2019ve found, I\u2019ll do this.\u201d I concentrated, muttered a binding, and moved my half of the stick.\nMarten jumped two feet up and five feet back, dropping the stick. To his credit, he didn\u2019t shout. \u201cWhat in ten hells was that?\u201d he hissed, wringing his hand.\nHis reaction had startled me, and my own heart was racing. \u201cMarten, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just a little sympathy.\u201d I saw a wrinkle in between his eyebrows and changed my tack. \u201cJust a small magic. It\u2019s like a bit of magic string I use to tie two things together.\u201d\nI imagined Elxa Dal swallowing his tongue at this description, but pressed ahead. \u201cI can tie these things together, so when I tug on mine . . .\u201d I moved to stand over where his half of the twig lay on the ground. I raised my half, and", "the half on the ground lifted into the air.\nMy display had the desired effect. Moving together, the two twigs looked\nlike the crudest, saddest string puppet in the world. Nothing to be frightened of. \u201cIt\u2019s just like invisible string, except it won\u2019t get tangled or caught on anything.\u201d\n\u201cHow hard will it pull at me?\u201d he asked warily. \u201cI don\u2019t want it yanking me out of a tree when I\u2019m scouting.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just me on the other end of the string,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll just jiggle it a bit. Like the float on a fishing line.\u201d\nMarten stopped wringing his hand and relaxed a little. \u201cStartled me is all,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s my fault,\u201d I said. \u201cI should have warned you.\u201d I picked up the stick, handling it with a deliberate casualness. As if it were nothing more than an ordinary stick. Of course it was nothing more than an ordinary stick, but Marten needed to be reassured as to that point. It\u2019s like Teccam said, nothing in the world is harder than convincing someone of an unfamiliar truth.\nMarten showed us how to see when leaves or needles had been disturbed, how to spot when stones had been walked across, how to tell if moss or lichen had been damaged by someone\u2019s passing.\nThe old huntsman was a surprisingly good teacher. He didn\u2019t belabor his points, didn\u2019t talk down to us, and didn\u2019t mind questions. Even Tempi\u2019s trouble with the language didn\u2019t frustrate him.\nEven so, it took hours. A full half day. Then, when I thought we were finally finished, Marten turned us around and started leading us back toward the camp.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already been that way,\u201d I said. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to practice, let\u2019s practice in the right direction.\u201d\nMarten ignored me and kept walking. \u201cTell me what you see.\u201d\nTwenty paces later, Tempi pointed. \u201cMoss,\u201d he said. \u201cMy foot. I walked.\u201d Realization dawned, and I began to see all the marks Tempi and I had\nmade. For the next three hours, Marten walked us step by humiliating step back through the trees, showing us everything we had done to betray our presence there: a scuff against the lichen on a tree trunk, a piece of freshly\n \nbroken rock, the discoloration of overturned pine needles.\nWorst of all were a half-dozen bright green leaves that lay shredded on the\nground in a tidy semicircle. Marten raised an eyebrow, and I blushed. I had plucked them from a nearby bush, idly shredding them while listening to Marten.\n\u201cThink twice and step carefully,\u201d Marten said. \u201cAnd keep an eye on each other.\u201d He looked back and forth between Tempi and me. \u201cWe\u2019re playing a dangerous game here.\u201d\nThen Marten showed us how to cover our tracks. It quickly became clear that a poorly concealed sign was often more obvious than one simply left alone. So over the next two hours we learned how to hide our mistakes and spot mistakes that others had tried to hide.\nOnly then, as afternoon was turning to evening, did Tempi and I begin searching this swath of forest bigger than most baronies. We walked close together, zigzagging back and forth, looking for any sign of the bandits\u2019 trail.\nI thought about the long days stretching out ahead of us. I\u2019d thought searching the Archives had been tedious. But looking for a broken twig in this much forest made hunting for the gram seem like going to the baker for a bun.\nIn the Archives I had the chance to make accidental discoveries. In the Archives I\u2019d had my friends: conversation, jokes, affection. Looking sideways at Tempi, I realized I could count the words he had said today: twenty-four, and the number of times he had met my eye: three.\nHow long would this take? Ten days? Twenty? Merciful Tehlu, could I spend a month out here without going mad?\nWith thoughts like this, when I saw some bark chipped off a tree and a tuft of grass bent the wrong way, I was flooded with relief.\nNot wanting to get my hopes up, I motioned to Tempi. \u201cDo you see anything here?\u201d He nodded, fidgeting with the collar of his shirt, then pointed to the grass I\u2019d spotted. Then he pointed to a scuffed bit of exposed root I hadn\u2019t noticed.\nAlmost light-headed with excitement, I pulled out the oak twig and signaled Marten. I twitched it very gently, not wanting to send him into another panic.\nIt was only two minutes before Marten came out of the trees, but in that time, I had already formed three plans as to how to track and kill the bandits, composed five apologetic soliloquies to Denna, and decided that when I got", "back to Severen, I would donate money to the Tehlin church as thanks for this tangible miracle.\nI expected Marten to be irritated that we\u2019d called him back so soon. But his expression was purely matter-of-fact as he came to stand next to us.\nI pointed out the grass, the bark, and the root. \u201cTempi spotted the last.\u201d I said, giving credit where credit is due.\n\u201cGood,\u201d he said seriously. \u201cGood job. There\u2019s also a bent branch over there.\u201d He gestured a few paces off to the right.\nI turned to face the direction the trail seemed to indicate. \u201cOdds are they\u2019re going to be north of here,\u201d I said. \u201cFarther from the road. Do you think it would be better to scout things out a bit now, or wait until tomorrow when we\u2019re fresh?\u201d\nMarten squinted at me. \u201cGood lord, boy. These aren\u2019t real trail signs. So obvious, all so close together.\u201d He gave me a long look.\u201cI left them. I needed to make sure you weren\u2019t going to glaze over after a few minutes of looking.\u201d My elation fell from some place in my chest and landed around my feet, shattering like a glass jar tipped from a high shelf. My expression must have been pitiful, as Marten gave me an apologetic smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should have told you. I\u2019ll be doing it off and on every day. It\u2019s the only chance we have to stay alert. This isn\u2019t my first time hunting through haystacks, you know.\u201d\nThe third time we called Martin back, he suggested we make a standing wager. Tempi and I would win a ha\u2019penny for every sign we found, and he\u2019d win a silver bit for every one we missed. I jumped at the offer. Not only would it help keep us on our toes, but five-to-one odds seemed rather generous.\nThis made the rest of the day pass quickly. Tempi and I missed a few signs: a log shifted out of place, some scattered leaves, and a broken spiderweb. I thought this last one was a bit unfair, but even so, by the time we headed back to camp that evening, Tempi and I were two pennies ahead.\nOver supper, Marten told a story about a young widow\u2019s son who left home to make his fortune. A tinker sold him a pair of magic boots that helped him rescue a princess from a tower high in the mountains.\n \nDedan nodded along while he ate, smiling as if he\u2019d heard it before. Hespe laughed in places, gasped in others, the perfect audience. Tempi sat perfectly still with his hands folded in his lap, showing none of the nervous restlessness I\u2019d come to expect from him. He stayed that way through the entire story, listening while his dinner grew cold.\nThe story was a good one. There was a hungry giant and a riddle game. But the widow\u2019s son was clever, and in the end he brought the princess back and married her. It was a familiar story, and listening to it reminded me of days long gone, back when I had a home, a family.", "CHAPTER EIGHTY\nTone\nTHE NEXT DAY MARTEN left with Hespe and Dedan while Tempi and I remained behind to keep an eye on the camp.\nWith nothing else to occupy my time, I started gathering extra firewood. Then I searched for useful herbs in the undergrowth and brought water from the nearby spring. Then I busied myself by unpacking, sorting, and rearranging everything in my travelsack.\nTempi disassembled his sword, meticulously cleaning and oiling all the pieces. He didn\u2019t look bored, but then again, he never looked like anything.\nBy midday I was nearly mad with boredom. I would have read, but I hadn\u2019t brought a book. I would have sewn pockets into my threadbare cloak, but I didn\u2019t have any spare cloth. I would have played my lute, but a trouper\u2019s lute is designed to carry music through a noisy taproom. Out here, the sound of it could carry for miles.\nI would have chatted with Tempi, but trying to have a conversation with him was like playing catch with a well.\nStill, it seemed to be my only option. I walked over to where Tempi sat. He had finished cleaning his sword and was making small adjustments to the leather grip. \u201cTempi?\u201d\nTempi lay aside his sword and came to his feet. He stood uncomfortably close to me, with barely more than eight inches of space between us. Then he hesitated and frowned. It wasn\u2019t much of a frown, barely a thinning of the lips and a slight line between his eyebrows, but on Tempi\u2019s blank sheet of a face, it stood out like a word written in red ink.\nHe backed away from me by two good paces, then eyed the ground between us and stepped forward slightly.\nUnderstanding dawned on me. \u201cTempi, how close do Adem stand?\u201d\nTempi looked at me blankly for a second, then burst out laughing. A shy smile flickered onto his face, making him look very young. It left his mouth quickly, but lingered around his eyes. \u201cSmart. Yes. Different in Adem. For", "you, close.\u201d He stepped uncomfortably close, then backed away. \u201cFor me?\u201d I asked. \u201cIs it different for different people?\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cHow close for Dedan?\u201d\nHe fidgeted. \u201cComplicated.\u201d\nI felt a familiar curiosity flicker up inside me. \u201cTempi,\u201d I asked. \u201cWould you teach me these things? Teach me your language?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said. And though his face betrayed none of it, I could hear a great weight of relief in his voice. \u201cYes. Please. Yes.\u201d\nBy the end of the afternoon, I had learned a wild, useless scattering of Ademic words. The grammar was still a mystery, but that is how it always begins. Luckily, languages are like musical instruments: the more you know, the easier it is to pick up new ones. Ademic was my fourth.\nOur major problem was that Tempi\u2019s Aturan was not very good, which gave us little common ground. So we drew in the dirt, pointed, and waved our hands quite a bit. Several times, when mere gestures were not enough, we ended up performing something close to pantomime or little mummer\u2019s plays in order to get our meaning across. It was more entertaining than I had expected.\nThere was one stumbling block the first day. I had learned a dozen words and thought of another that would be useful. I made a fist and pretended to throw a punch at Tempi.\n\u201cFreaht,\u201d he said.\n\u201cFreaht,\u201d I repeated.\nHe shook his head. \u201cNo. Freaht.\u201d\n\u201cFreaht,\u201d I said carefully.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cFreaht is . . .\u201d He bared his teeth and worked his\njaw as if he were biting something. \u201cFreaht.\u201d He punched his fist into his palm.\n\u201cFreaht,\u201d I said.\n\u201cNo.\u201d I was amazed at the weight of condescension in his voice. \u201cFreaht.\u201d My face got hot. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. Freaht! Freaht! Fre\u2014\u201d\nTempi reached out and smacked me in the side of the head with the flat of\n \nhis hand. It was the same way he had struck Dedan last night, the way my father had cuffed me when I was being troublesome in public. It wasn\u2019t hard enough to hurt, it was just startling. No one had done that to me in years.\nEven more startling was that I hardly saw it. The motion was smooth and lazy and faster than snapping your fingers. He didn\u2019t seem to mean anything insulting by it. He was merely getting my attention.\nHe lifted his sandy hair and pointed to his ear. \u201cHear,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cFreaht.\u201d He bared his teeth again, making a biting motion. \u201cFreaht.\u201d Raised fist. \u201cFreaht. Freaht.\u201d\nAnd I did hear it. It wasn\u2019t the sound of the word itself, it was the cadence of the word. \u201cFreaht?\u201d I said.\nHe favored me with a small, rare smile. \u201cYes. Good.\u201d\nThen I had to go back and relearn all the words, making note of their rhythm. I hadn\u2019t really heard it before, just mimicked it. Slowly, I discovered each word could have several different meanings depending on cadence of the sound that composed them.\nI learned the all-important phrases \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d and \u201cExplain that more slowly,\u201d in addition to a couple dozen words: Fight. Look. Sword. Hand. Dance. The dumbshow I had to perform to get him to understand the last of these left both of us laughing.\nIt was fascinating. The differing cadences of each word meant the language itself had a sort of music to it. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder . . .\n\u201cTempi?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat are your songs like?\u201d He looked at me blankly for a moment, and I thought he might not understand the abstract question. \u201cCould you sing me an Adem song?\u201d\n\u201cWhat is song?\u201d he asked. In the last hour, Tempi had learned twice as many words as I had.\nI cleared my throat and sang:\nLittle Jenny no-shoes went a-walking with the wind.\nShe was looking for a bonny boy to laugh and make her grin.\nUpon her head a feather cap, upon her lips a whistle.\nHer lips were wet and honey sweet. Her tongue was sharp as thistle.\nTempi\u2019s eyes went wide as I sang. He practically gaped.\n\u201cYou?\u201d I prompted, pointing to his chest. \u201cCan you sing an Adem song?\u201d His face flushed a burning red, and a dozen emotions ran wild and", "undisguised over his face: astonishment, horror, embarrassment, shock, disgust. He got to his feet, turning away and chattering something in Ademic far too quickly for me to follow. He looked for all the world as if I\u2019d just asked him to strip naked and dance for me.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, managing to collect himself somewhat. His face was composed again, but his fair skin was still flushed a violent red. \u201cNo.\u201d Looking down at the ground, he touched his chest, shaking his head. \u201cNo song. No Adem song.\u201d\nI got to my feet as well, not knowing what I\u2019d done wrong. \u201cTempi. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nTempi shook his head. \u201cNo. Nothing sorry.\u201d He drew a deep breath and shook his head as he turned and started to walk away. \u201cComplicated.\u201d", "CHAPTER EIGHTY-ONE\nThe Jealous Moon\nTHAT EVENING MARTEN SHOT a trio of fat rabbits. I dug roots and picked a few herbs, and before the sun was down the five of us sat down to a meal made perfect by the addition of two large loaves of fresh bread, butter, and a crumbly cheese too local to have any specific name.\nSpirits were high after a day of good weather, and so with dinner came more stories.\nHespe told a surprisingly romantic tale of a queen who loved a serving boy. She told her story with a gentle passion. And if her telling didn\u2019t show a tender heart, the looks she gave Dedan as she spoke of the queen\u2019s love did.\nDedan, however, failed to see the marks of love on her. And with a folly I have rarely seen equaled, he began to tell a story he\u2019d heard at the Pennysworth Inn. A tale of Felurian.\n\u201cThe boy who told me this was hardly as old as Kvothe here,\u201d Dedan said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019d heard him talk you\u2019d have seen he wasn\u2019t the sort who could invent such a tale.\u201d The mercenary tapped his temple meaningfully. \u201cBut listen and judge for yourself if it\u2019s worth believing.\u201d\nAs I\u2019ve said, Dedan had a good tongue in his head, and a sharper wit than you\u2019d guess, when he decided to use it. Unfortunately, this was one of the times that the former was working and the latter was not.\n\u201cFor time out of mind, men have been wary of this stretch of woods. Not for fear of lawless men or becoming lost.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNo. They say the fair folk make their homes here.\n\u201cCloven-hoofed pucks that dance when the moon is full. Dark things with long fingers that steal babes from cribs. Many\u2019s the woman, old wife or new, who leaves out bread and milk at night. And many\u2019s the man who makes well sure he builds his house with all his doors in a row.\n\u201cSome might call these folk superstitious, but they know the truth. The safest thing is to avoid the Fae, but barring that, you want to keep in their good graces.", "\u201cThis is a story of Felurian. Lady of Twilight. Lady of the First Quiet. Felurian, who is death to men. But a glad death, and one they go to willingly.\u201d\nTempi drew a breath. It was a small motion, but it was eye-catching as he\u2019d continued his habit of sitting perfectly still through the evening\u2019s stories. Now this made better sense to me. He was being quiet.\n\u201cFelurian,\u201d Tempi asked. \u201cDeath to men. She is\u2014\u201d he paused. \u201cShe is sentin?\u201d He lifted his hands in front of himself and made a sort of gripping gesture. He eyed us expectantly. Then, seeing we didn\u2019t understand, he touched his sword where it lay at his side.\nI understood. \u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019s not one of the Adem.\u201d\nTempi shook his head and pointed at Marten\u2019s bow.\nI shook my head. \u201cNo. She\u2019s not a fighter at all. She . . .\u201d I trailed off,\nunable to think of how I would explain how Felurian killed men, especially if we were forced to resort to gestures. Desperate, I looked to Dedan for help.\nDedan didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cSex,\u201d he said frankly. \u201cDo you know sex?\u201d\nTempi blinked, then threw back his head and laughed. Dedan looked as if he were trying to decide whether or not to be offended. After a moment Tempi caught his breath. \u201cYes,\u201d he said simply. \u201cYes. I know sex.\u201d\nDedan smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s how she kills men.\u201d\nFor a moment, Tempi looked more blank than usual, then a slow horror spread across his face. No, not horror, it was raw disgust and revulsion, made all the worse by the fact that his face was usually so blank. His hand clenched into several unfamiliar gestures at his side. \u201cHow?\u201d he choked out the word.\nDedan started to say something, then stopped. Then he started to make a gesture and stopped that as well, looking self-consciously at Hespe.\nHespe chuckled low in her throat and turned to Tempi. She thought for a moment, then made a gesture as if holding someone in her arms, kissing them. Then she began to tap her chest rhythmically, mimicking a heartbeat. She beat faster and faster, then stopped, clenching her hand into a fist and making her eyes wide. She tensed her whole body, then went limp, lolling her head to one side.\nDedan laughed and clapped at her performance. \u201cThat\u2019s it. But sometimes . . .\u201d He tapped his temple, then snapped his fingers, crossing his eyes and sticking out his tongue. \u201cCrazy.\u201d\nTempi relaxed. \u201cOh,\u201d he said, plainly relieved. \u201cGood. Yes.\u201d\nDedan nodded and settled back into his story. \u201cRight. Felurian. Fondest", "desire of all men. Beauty beyond compare.\u201d For Tempi\u2019s benefit, he made a gesture as if he were brushing out long hair.\n\u201cTwenty years ago, this boy\u2019s father and uncle were out hunting in this very stretch of forest as the sun began to set. They stayed out later than they should, then decided to make their way home by cutting straight through the forest instead of using the road like sensible folk.\n\u201cThey hadn\u2019t been walking very long when they heard singing in the distance. They made their way toward it, thinking they were close to the road, but instead they found themselves at the edge of a small clearing. And there stood Felurian singing softly to herself:\nCae-Lanion Luhial di mari Felanua Kreata Tu ciar\ntu alaran di Dirella. Amauen. Loesi an delan\ntu nia vor ruhlan Felurian thae.\u201d\nThough Dedan made rough work of the tune, I shivered at the sound of it. The melody was eerie, compelling, and utterly unfamiliar. I didn\u2019t recognize the language, either. Not a bit of it.\nDedan nodded as he saw my reaction. \u201cMore than anything, that song gives the boy\u2019s story the ring of truth. I can\u2019t put a bit of sense to those words, but they stuck right in my head even though he only sang it once.\n\u201cSo the two brothers are huddled at the edge of the clearing. And thanks to the moon they could see like it was noon instead of night. She wan\u2019t wearing a stitch, and though her hair was almost to her waist, it were real obvious she was as naked as the moon.\u201d\nI have always enjoyed stories about Felurian, but as I glanced at Hespe my anticipation cooled. She was watching Dedan, and as he spoke, her eyes narrowed.\nDedan failed to see this. \u201cShe was tall with long graceful legs. Her waist was slender, her hips curved as if begging for the touch of a hand. Her stomach was perfect and smooth, like a flawless piece of birch bark, and the dimple of her navel seemed made for kissing.\u201d", "Hespe\u2019s eyes were dangerous slits by this point. But even more telling was her mouth, which had formed a thin, straight line. A word of advice to you. Should you ever see that look on a woman\u2019s face, leave off talking at once and sit on both your hands. It may not mend matters, but it will at least keep you from making them any worse.\nUnfortunately Dedan continued, his thick hands gesturing in the firelight. \u201cHer breasts were full and round, like peaches waiting to be taken from the tree. Even the jealous moon which steals the color from all things couldn\u2019t hide the rosy\u2014\u201d\nHespe made a disgusted noise and pushed herself to her feet. \u201cI\u2019ll just leave then,\u201d she said. Her voice held such a chill even Dedan couldn\u2019t miss it.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d He looked up to her, still holding his hands in front of himself, frozen in the act of cupping an imagined pair of breasts.\nShe stormed away, muttering under her breath.\nDedan let his hands drop heavily into his lap. His expression moved from confused to injured to angry in the space of a breath. After a second he got to his feet, roughly brushing bits of leaf and twig from his pants and muttering to himself. Gathering up his blankets, he started toward the other side of our little clearing.\n\u201cDid it end with both brothers chasing after her, and the boy\u2019s father falling behind?\u201d I asked.\nDedan looked back at me. \u201cYou\u2019ve already heard it then. You could have stopped me if you didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just guessing,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cI hate not hearing the ending of a story.\u201d\n\u201cFather put his foot in a rabbit hole,\u201d Dedan said shortly. \u201cSprained his ankle. Nobody saw the uncle again.\u201d He stalked out of the circle of firelight, his expression grim.\nI cast an imploring look at Marten, who shook his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI won\u2019t have any part of it. Not for the world. Trying to help right now would be like trying to put out a fire with my hands. Painful, and with no real results.\u201d\nTempi began to make up his bed. Marten made a circular gesture with one finger and gave me a questioning look, asking if I wanted the first watch. I nodded, and he gathered up his bedroll, saying, \u201cAttractive as some things are, you have to weigh your risks. How badly do you want it, how badly are you willing to be burned?\u201d", "I spread the fire and soon the deep dark of night settled into the clearing. I lay on my back, looked at the stars, and thought of Denna.", "CHAPTER EIGHTY-TWO\nBarbarians\nTHE NEXT DAY, TEMPI and I moved camp while Dedan and Hespe walked back to Crosson for supplies. Marten scouted out an isolated piece of flat ground close to water. Then we packed and moved everything, dug the privy, built the firepit, and generally got everything settled.\nTempi was willing to talk as we worked, but I was nervous. I had offended him by asking about the Lethani early on, so I knew to avoid that subject. But if he was upset by a simple question about singing, how could I begin to guess what might offend him?\nAgain, his blank expression and refusal to make eye contact were the main problems. How could I make intelligent conversation with a person when I had no idea how he felt? It was like trying to walk blindfolded through an unfamiliar house.\nSo I took the safer road and simply asked for more words as we worked. Objects, for the most part, as we were both too busy with our hands to pantomime.\nBest of all, Tempi got to practice his Aturan while I built up my Ademic vocabulary. I noticed the more mistakes I made in his language, the more comfortable he grew in his own attempts at expressing himself.\nThis meant, of course, that I made many mistakes. In fact, I was occasionally so thickheaded that Tempi was forced to explain himself several times in several different ways. All in Aturan of course.\nWe finished setting up camp around noon. Marten left to go hunting and Tempi stretched and began to move through his slow dance. He did it twice in a row, and I began to suspect he was somewhat bored himself. By the time he finished he was covered in a sheen of sweat and told me he was going to bathe.\nWith the camp to myself, I melted down the tinker\u2019s candles to make two small wax simulacra. I\u2019d been wanting to do this for days, but even at the University creating a mommet was questionable behavior. Here in Vintas . . .", "suffice to say I thought it best to be discreet.\nIt wasn\u2019t elegant work. Tallow isn\u2019t nearly as convenient as sympathy wax,\nbut even the crudest mommet can be a devastating thing. Once I had them tucked into my travelsack, I felt much better prepared.\nI was cleaning the last of the tallow off my fingers when Tempi returned from his bath, naked as a new baby. Years of stage training allowed me to keep a calm expression, but just barely.\nAfter spreading his wet clothing over a nearby branch to dry, Tempi walked over to me without showing the least embarrassment or modesty.\nHe held out his right hand, thumb and forefinger pinched together. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d He spread his fingers slightly for me to see.\nI looked closely, glad to have something to focus my attention on. \u201cThat\u2019s a tick.\u201d\nThis close, I couldn\u2019t help but notice his scars again, faint lines crossing his arms and chest. I could read scars from my time in the Medica, and his didn\u2019t show the wide, puckered pink that would indicate a deep wound cutting through the layers of skin, fat, and muscle underneath. These were shallow wounds. Dozens of them. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder how long he had been a mercenary to have scars so old. He didn\u2019t look much older than twenty.\nOblivious to my scrutiny, Tempi stared at the thing between his fingers. \u201cIt bites. On me. Bites and stays.\u201d His expression was blank as always, but his tone was tinged with disgust. His left hand fidgeted.\n\u201cThere are no ticks in Ademre?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d He made a point of trying to pinch it between his fingers. \u201cIt not break.\u201d\nI gestured, showing him how to crush it between his fingernails, which he did with a certain amount of relish. He threw it away and stalked back to his bedroll. Then, still naked, he proceeded to pull out all of his clothing and give it a vigorous shaking.\nI kept my eyes averted, knowing deep down in my heart that this would be the moment Dedan and Hespe would return from Crosson.\nThankfully they didn\u2019t. After a quarter hour or so, Tempi put on a pair of dry pants, carefully inspecting them first.\nShirtless, he walked back to where I sat. \u201cI hate tick,\u201d he declared.\nWhen he spoke, his left hand made a sharp gesture, as if he were brushing crumbs off the front of his shirt near his hip. Except he wasn\u2019t wearing a", "shirt, and there was nothing on his bare skin to brush away. What\u2019s more, I realized he\u2019d made the same gesture earlier.\nIn fact, now that I thought of it, I\u2019d seen him make that gesture a half- dozen times in the last several days, though never so violently.\nI had a sudden suspicion. \u201cTempi? What does this mean?\u201d I mimicked the brushing away gesture.\nHe nodded. \u201cIt is this.\u201d He scrunched his face up in an exaggerated expression of disgust.\nMy mind went spinning back over the last span of days, thinking of how many times I had seen Tempi fidgeting restlessly while we talked. I reeled at the thought of it.\n\u201cTempi,\u201d I asked. \u201cIs all of this?\u201d I made a gesture to my face, then smiled, frowned, rolled my eyes. \u201cDoes all this happen with hands in Ademic?\u201d\nHe nodded and made a gesture at the same time.\n\u201cThat!\u201d I pointed at his hand. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\nHe hesitated, then gave a forced, awkward-looking smile.\nI copied the gesture, splaying my hand slightly and pressing my thumb to\nthe inside of my middle finger.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cOther hand. Left.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nHe reached out and thumped on my chest, just left of the breastbone: Tum-\ntump. Tum-tump. Then he ran a finger down to my left hand. I nodded to show I understood. It was closest to the heart. He held up his right hand and made a fist. \u201cThis hand is strong.\u201d He held up his left. \u201cThis hand is clever.\u201d\nIt made sense. That is why most lutists chord with the left hand and strum with their right. The left hand is more nimble, as a rule.\nI made the gesture with my left hand, fingers splayed. Tempi shook his head. \u201cThat is this.\u201d He quirked half of his mouth up into a smirk.\nThe expression seemed so out of place on his face that it was all I could do to keep from gawking. I looked more closely at his hand and adjusted the position of my fingers slightly.\nHe nodded approval. His face was expressionless, but for the first time I understood why.\nIn the hours that followed, I learned that Ademic hand gestures did not actually represent facial expressions. It was nothing so simple as that. For example a smile can mean you\u2019re amused, happy, grateful, or satisfied. You can smile to comfort someone. You can smile because you\u2019re content or", "because you\u2019re in love. A grimace or a grin look similar to a smile, but they mean entirely different things.\nImagine trying to teach someone how to smile. Imagine trying to describe what different smiles mean and when, precisely, to use them in conversation. It\u2019s harder than learning to walk.\nSuddenly so many things made sense. Of course Tempi wouldn\u2019t look me in the eye. There was nothing to be gained by looking at the face of the person you were talking to. You listen to the voice, but you watch the hand.\nI spent the next several hours attempting to learn the basics, but it was maddeningly difficult. Words are fairly simple things. You can point to a stone. You can act out running or jumping. But have you ever tried to pantomime compliance? Respect? Sarcasm? I doubt even my father could have accomplished such a thing.\nBecause of this my progress was frustratingly slow, but I couldn\u2019t help but be fascinated. It was like suddenly being given a second tongue.\nAnd it was a secret thing, of sorts. I have always had a weakness for secrets.\nIt took three hours to learn a handful of gestures, if you\u2019ll pardon the pun. My progress felt glacial, but when I finally learned the hand-speak for \u201cunderstatement\u201d I felt a glow of pride that can barely be described.\nI think Tempi felt it too. \u201cGood,\u201d he said with a flattening of the hand I was fairly certain indicated approval. He rolled his shoulders and got to his feet, stretching. He glanced at the sun through the branches overhead. \u201cFood now?\u201d\n\u201cSoon.\u201d There was one question that had been bothering me. \u201cTempi, why make all this work?\u201d I asked. \u201cA smile is easy. Why smile with your hands?\u201d\n\u201cWith hands is easy too. Better. More . . .\u201d He made a slightly modified version of the shirt-brushing gesture he\u2019d used earlier. Not disgust, irritation? \u201cWhat is the word for people living together. Roads. Right things.\u201d He ran his thumb along his collarbone, was that frustration? \u201cWhat is word for good together living? Nobody shits in the well.\u201d\nI laughed. \u201cCivilization?\u201d\nHe nodded, splaying his fingers: amusement. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cSpeaking with hands is civilization.\u201d\n\u201cBut smiling is natural,\u201d I protested. \u201cEveryone smiles.\u201d\n\u201cNatural is not civilization,\u201d Tempi said. \u201cCooking meat is civilization. Washing off stink is civilization.\u201d", "\u201cSo in Ademre you always smile with hands?\u201d I wished I knew the gesture for dismay.\n\u201cNo. Smiling with face good with family. Good with some friend.\u201d \u201cWhy only family?\u201d\nTempi repeated his thumb-on-collarbone gesture again. \u201cWhen you make\nthis.\u201d He pressed his palm to the side of his face and blew air into it, making a great flatulent noise. \u201cThat is natural, but you do not make it near others. Rude. With family . . .\u201d He shrugged. Amusement. \u201c. . . civilization not important. More natural with family.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about laughing?\u201d I asked. \u201cI have seen you laugh.\u201d I made a ha-ha sound so he knew what I was talking about.\nHe shrugged. \u201cLaughing is.\u201d\nI waited for a moment, but he didn\u2019t seem inclined to continue. I tried again. \u201cWhy not laugh with hands?\u201d\nTempi shook his head. \u201cNo. Laugh is different.\u201d He stepped close and used two fingers to tap my chest over my heart. \u201cSmile?\u201d He ran his finger down my left arm. \u201cAngry?\u201d He tapped my heart again. He made a scared expression, a confused one, and poked his lip out in a ridiculous pout. Each time he tapped my chest.\n\u201cBut laugh?\u201d He pressed the flat of his hand against my stomach. \u201cHere lives laugh.\u201d He ran his finger straight up to my mouth and spread his fingers. \u201cPush back laugh is not good. Not healthy.\u201d\n\u201cAlso cry?\u201d I asked. I traced an imaginary tear down my cheek with one finger.\n\u201cAlso cry.\u201d He put his hand on his own belly. \u201cHa ha ha,\u201d he said, pressing in with his hand to show me the motion of his stomach. Then his expression changed to sad. \u201cHuh huh huh,\u201d he heaved with exaggerated sobs, pressing his stomach again. \u201cSame place. Not healthy to push down.\u201d\nI nodded slowly, trying to imagine what it must be like for Tempi, constantly assaulted by people too rude to keep their expressions to themselves. People whose hands constantly made gestures that were nonsense. \u201cIt must be very hard for you, out here.\u201d\n\u201cNot so hard.\u201d Understatement. \u201cWhen I leave Ademre, I know this. Not civilization. Barbarians are rude.\u201d\n\u201cBarbarians?\u201d\nHe made a wide gesture, encompassing our clearing, the forest, all of Vintas. \u201cEveryone here like dogs.\u201d He made a grotesquely exaggerated", "expression of rage, showing all his teeth, snarling and rolling his eyes madly. \u201cThat is all you know.\u201d He shrugged nonchalant acceptance, as if to say he didn\u2019t hold it against us.\n\u201cWhat of children?\u201d I asked. \u201cChildren smile before they talk. Is that wrong?\u201d\nTempi shook his head. \u201cAll children barbarians. All smile with face. All children rude. But they go old. Watch. Learn.\u201d He paused thoughtfully. Choosing his words. \u201cBarbarians have no woman to teach them civilization. Barbarians cannot learn.\u201d\nI could tell he didn\u2019t mean any offense, but it made me more determined than ever to learn the particulars of the Adem hand-talk.\nTempi stood and began limbering up with a number of stretches similar to those the tumblers used in my troupe when I was young. After fifteen minutes of twisting himself this way and that, he began his slow, dancelike pantomime. Though I didn\u2019t know it at the time, it was called the Ketan.\nStill nettled about Tempi\u2019s \u201cbarbarians cannot learn\u201d comment, I decided I would follow along. After all, I didn\u2019t have anything better to do.\nAs I tried to mimic him, I became aware of how devilishly complex it was: keeping the hands cupped just so, the feet correctly positioned. Despite the fact that Tempi moved with almost glacial slowness, I found it impossible to imitate his smooth grace. Tempi never paused or looked in my direction. He never offered a word of encouragement or advice.\nIt was exhausting, and I was glad when it was over. Then I started the fire and lashed together a tripod. Wordlessly, Tempi brought out a hard sausage and several potatoes that he began to peel carefully using his sword.\nI was surprised by this, as Tempi fussed over his sword much the same way I did with my lute. Once when Dedan had picked it up, the Adem had responded with a rather dramatic emotional outburst. Dramatic for Tempi, that is. He\u2019d spoken two full sentences and frowned a bit.\nTempi saw me watching him and cocked his head curiously.\nI pointed. \u201cSword?\u201d I asked. \u201cFor cutting potatoes?\u201d\nTempi looked down at the half-peeled potato in one hand, his sword in\nanother. \u201cIs sharp.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIs clean.\u201d\nI returned the shrug, not wanting to make an issue of it. While working\ntogether, I learned the words for iron, knot, leaf, spark, and salt.\nWaiting for the water to boil, Tempi stood, shook himself, and began his\nlimbering stretches a second time. I followed him again. It was harder this", "time. The muscles of my arms and legs were loose and shaky from my previous effort. Toward the end I had to fight to keep myself from trembling, but I gleaned a few more secrets.\nTempi continued to ignore me, but I didn\u2019t mind. I\u2019ve always been drawn to a challenge.", "CHAPTER EIGHTY-THREE\nLack of Sight\n\u201c. . . SO TABORLIN WAS PRISONED deep underground,\u201d Marten said. \u201cThey had left him with nothing but the clothes upon his back and an inch of guttering candle to push away the darkness.\n\u201cThe sorcerer-king planned to leave Taborlin trapped until hunger and thirst weakened his will. Scyphus knew if Taborlin swore to help him, the wizard would abide by his promise, because Taborlin never broke his word.\n\u201cWorst of all, Scyphus had taken Taborlin\u2019s staff and sword, and without them his power was all dim and guttery. He\u2019d even taken Taborlin\u2019s cloak of no particular color, but he warc\u2014sorry. But\u2014achhm. Hespe, would you be a darling and pass me the skin?\u201d\nHespe tossed Marten the waterskin and he took a deep drink. \u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cWhere was I again?\u201d\nWe had been in the Eld for twelve days, and things had fallen into a steady rhythm. Marten had changed our standing wager to reflect our growing skill. First to ten to one, then fifteen to one, which was the same arrangement he had with Dedan and Hespe.\nMy understanding of the Adem hand-language was growing, and as a result, Tempi was becoming something other than a frustrating blank page of a man. As I learned to read his body language, he was slowly being colored in around the edges.\nHe was thoughtful and gentle. Dedan rubbed him the wrong way. He loved jokes, though many of mine fell flat, and the ones he tried to tell invariably made no sense in translation.\nThis isn\u2019t to say things were perfect between us. I still offended Tempi occasionally, making social gaffes I couldn\u2019t understand even after the fact. Every day I continued to follow him in his strange dance, and every day he pointedly ignored me.\n\u201cNow Taborlin needed to escape,\u201d Marten said, continuing his story. \u201cBut when he looked around his cave, he saw no door. No windows. All around", "him was nothing but smooth, hard stone.\n\u201cBut Taborlin the Great knew the names of all things, so all things were his\nto command. He said to the stone: \u2018break!\u2019 and the stone broke. The wall tore like a piece of paper, and through that hole Taborlin could see the sky and breathe the sweet spring air.\n\u201cTaborlin made his way out of the caves, into the castle, and finally to the doors of the royal hall itself. The doors were barred against him, so he said, 'burn!\u2019 and they burst into flame and were soon nothing more than fine grey ash.\n\u201cTaborlin stepped into the hall and saw King Scyphus sitting there with fifty guards. The king said, \u2018Capture him!\u2019 But the guards had just seen the doors burn to ash, so they moved closer, but none of them came too close, if you know what I mean.\n\u201cKing Scyphus said, 'Cowards! I will battle Taborlin with wizardry and best him!\u2019 He was afraid of Taborlin too, but he hid it well. Besides, Scyphus had his staff, and Taborlin had none.\n\u201cThen Taborlin said, \u2018If you\u2019re so brave, give me my staff before we duel.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Certainly,\u2019 Scyphus said, even though he didn\u2019t really mean to give it back, you see. \u2018It\u2019s right next to you in that chest there.\u2019 \u201d\nMarten looked around at us conspiratorially. \u201cYou see, Scyphus knew the chest was locked and had only one key. And that key was right in his pocket. So Taborlin went over to the chest, but it was locked. Then Scyphus laughed and so did a few of the guards.\n\u201cThat made Taborlin angry. And before any of them could do anything he struck the top of the chest with his hand and shouted, 'Edro!\u2019 The chest sprung open and he grabbed his cloak of no particular color, wrapping it around himself.\u201d\nMarten cleared his throat again. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d he said, and paused to take another long drink.\nHespe turned to Dedan. \u201cWhat color do you think Taborlin\u2019s cloak was?\u201d\nDedan\u2019s forehead creased a bit, almost like the beginning of a scowl. \u201cWhat do you mean? It\u2019s no particular color, just like it says.\u201d\nHespe\u2019s mouth went flat. \u201cI know that. But when you think of it in your head, what does it look like? You have to picture it as looking like something, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nDedan looked thoughtful for a moment. \u201cI always pictured it as kind of shimmery,\u201d he said. \u201cLike the cobblestones outside a tallow-works after a", "hard rain.\u201d\n\u201cI always thought of it as a dirty grey,\u201d she said. \u201cSort of washed out from\nhis being on the road all the time.\u201d\n\u201cThat makes good sense,\u201d Dedan said, and I watched Hespe\u2019s face go\ngentle again.\n\u201cWhite,\u201d Tempi volunteered. \u201cI think white. No color.\u201d\n\u201cI always thought of it as kind of a pale sky-blue,\u201d Marten admitted,\nshrugging. \u201cI know that doesn\u2019t make any sense. That\u2019s just how I picture it.\u201d Everyone turned to look at me.\n\u201cSometimes I think of it like a quilt,\u201d I said. \u201cMade entirely out of\npatchwork, a bunch of different colored rags and scraps. But most of the time I think of it as dark. Like it really is a color, but it\u2019s too dark for anyone to see.\u201d\nWhen I was younger, stories of Taborlin had left me wide-eyed with wonder. Now that I knew the truth about magic, I enjoyed them on a different level, somewhere between nostalgia and amusement.\nBut I held a special place in my heart for Taborlin\u2019s cloak of no particular color. His staff held much of his power. His sword was deadly. His key, coin, and candle were valuable tools. But the cloak was at the heart of Taborlin. It was a disguise when he needed it, helped him hide when he was in trouble. It protected him. From rain. From arrows. From fire.\nHe could hide things in it, and it had many pockets full of wonderful things. A knife. A toy for a child. A flower for a lady. Whatever Taborlin needed was somewhere in his cloak of no particular color. These stories are what made me beg my mother for my first cloak when I was young. . . .\nI drew my own cloak around me. My nasty, tatty, faded cloak the tinker had traded me. On one of our trips into Crosson for supplies, I\u2019d picked up some spare cloth and sewn a few clumsy pockets into the inside. But it was still a poor replacement for my rich burgundy cloak, or the lovely black and green one Fela had made for me.\nMarten cleared his throat again and launched back into his story. \u201cSo Taborlin struck the trunk with his hand and shouted. 'Edro!\u2019 The lid of the chest popped open, and he grabbed his cloak of no particular color and his staff. He called forth great barbs of lightning and killed twenty guards. Then he called forth a sheet of fire and killed another twenty. Those that were left threw down their swords and cried for mercy.\n\u201cThen Taborlin gathered up the rest of his things from the chest. He took", "out his key and coin and tucked them safe away. Lastly he brought out his copper sword, Skyaldrin, and belted\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Dedan interrupted, laughing. \u201cYou tit. Taborlin\u2019s sword wasn\u2019t copper.\u201d\n\u201cShut up, Den,\u201d Marten snapped, nettled at the interruption. \u201cIt was so copper.\u201d\n\u201cYou shut up,\u201d Dedan replied. \u201cWho\u2019s ever heard of a copper sword? Copper wouldn\u2019t hold an edge. It\u2019d be like trying to kill someone with a big penny.\u201d\nHespe laughed at that. \u201cIt was probably a silver sword, don\u2019t you think, Marten?\u201d\n\u201cIt was a copper sword,\u201d Marten insisted.\n\u201cMaybe it was early on in his career,\u201d Dedan said in a loud whisper to Hespe. \u201cAll he could afford was a copper sword.\u201d\nMarten shot the two of them an angry look. \u201cCopper, damn you. If you don\u2019t like it, you can just guess at the ending.\u201d He folded his arms in front of himself.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Dedan said. \u201cKvothe can give us one. He might be a pup, but he knows how to tell a proper story. Copper sword my ass.\u201d\n\u201cActually,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019d like to hear the end of Marten\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cOh go ahead,\u201d the old tracker said bitterly. \u201cI\u2019m in no mood to finish now. And I\u2019d rather listen to you than hear that donkey he-yaw his way through one of his.\u201d\nNightly stories had been one of the few times we could sit as a group without falling into petty bickering. Now, even they were becoming tense. What\u2019s more, the others were beginning to count on me for the evening\u2019s entertainment. Hoping to put an end to the trend, I\u2019d put a lot of thought into what story I was going to tell tonight.\n\u201cOnce upon a time,\u201d I began. \u201cThere was a little boy born in a little town. He was perfect, or so his mother thought. But one thing was different about him. He had a gold screw in his belly button. Just the head of it peeping out.\n\u201cNow his mother was simply glad he had all his fingers and toes to count with. But as the boy grew up he realized not everyone had screws in their belly buttons, let alone gold ones. He asked his mother what it was for, but she didn\u2019t know. Next he asked his father, but his father didn\u2019t know. He asked his grandparents, but they didn\u2019t know either.\n\u201cThat settled it for a while, but it kept nagging him. Finally, when he was", "old enough, he packed a bag and set out, hoping he could find someone who knew the truth of it.\n\u201cHe went from place to place, asking everyone who claimed to know something about anything. He asked midwives and physickers, but they couldn\u2019t make heads or tails of it. The boy asked arcanists, tinkers, and old hermits living in the woods, but no one had ever seen anything like it.\n\u201cHe went to ask the Cealdim merchants, thinking if anyone would know about gold, it would be them. But the Cealdim merchants didn\u2019t know. He went to the arcanists at the University, thinking if anyone would know about screws and their workings, they would. But the arcanists didn\u2019t know. The boy followed the road over the Stormwal to ask the witch women of the Tahl, but none of them could give him an answer.\n\u201cEventually he went to the King of Vint, the richest king in the world. But the king didn\u2019t know. He went to the Emperor of Atur, but even with all his power, the emperor didn\u2019t know. He went to each of the small kingdoms, one by one, but no one could tell him anything.\n\u201cFinally the boy went to the High King of Modeg, the wisest of all the kings in the world. The high king looked closely at the head of the golden screw peeping from the boy\u2019s belly button. Then the high king made a gesture, and his seneschal brought out a pillow of golden silk. On that pillow was a golden box. The high king took a golden key from around his neck, opened the box, and inside was a golden screwdriver.\n\u201cThe high king took the screwdriver and motioned the boy to come closer. Trembling with excitement, the boy did. Then the high king took the golden screwdriver and put it in the boy\u2019s belly button.\u201d\nI paused to take a long drink of water. I could feel my small audience leaning toward me. \u201cThen the high king carefully turned the golden screw. Once: Nothing. Twice: Nothing. Then he turned it the third time, and the boy\u2019s ass fell off.\u201d\nThere was a moment of stunned silence.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Hespe asked incredulously.\n\u201cHis ass fell off,\u201d I repeated with an absolutely straight face.\nThere was a long silence. Everyone\u2019s eyes were fixed on me. The fire\nsnapped, sending a red ember floating upward.\n\u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d Hespe finally asked.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s it. The end.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she said again, more loudly. \u201cWhat kind of story is that?\u201d", "I was about to respond when Tempi burst out laughing. And he kept laughing; great shaking laughs that left him breathless. Soon I began to laugh as well, partly at Tempi\u2019s display, and partly because I\u2019d always considered it an oddly funny story myself.\nHespe\u2019s expression turned dangerous, as if she were the butt of the joke.\nDedan was the first to speak. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Why did . . .?\u201d he trailed off.\n\u201cDid they get the boy\u2019s ass back on?\u201d Hespe interjected.\nI shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s not part of the story.\u201d\nDedan gestured wildly, his expression frustrated. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of it?\u201d I put on an innocent face. \u201cI thought we were just telling stories.\u201d\nThe big man scowled at me. \u201cSensible stories! Stories with endings. Not\nstories that just have a boy\u2019s ass . . .\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThis is ridiculous. I\u2019m going to sleep.\u201d He moved off to make his bed. Hespe stalked off in her own direction.\nI smiled, reasonably sure neither one of them would be troubling me for any more stories than I cared to tell.\nTempi got to his feet as well. Then, as he walked past me he smiled and gave me a sudden hug. A span of days ago this would have shocked me, but now I knew that physical contact was not particularly odd among the Adem.\nStill, I was surprised he did it in front of the others. I returned his hug as best I could, feeling his chest still shaking with laughter. \u201cHis ass off,\u201d he said quietly, then made his way to bed.\nMarten\u2019s eyes followed Tempi, then he gave me a long, speculative look. \u201cWhere did you hear that one?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cMy father told it to me when I was young,\u201d I said honestly.\n\u201cOdd story to tell a child.\u201d\n\u201cI was an odd child,\u201d I said. \u201cWhen I was older he confessed he made the\nstories up to keep me quiet. I used to pepper him with questions. Hour after hour. He said the only thing that would keep me quiet was some sort of puzzle. But I cracked riddles like walnuts, and he ran out of those.\u201d\nI shrugged and started to lay out my bed. \u201cSo he made up stories that seemed like puzzles and asked me if I understood what they meant.\u201d I smiled a little wistfully. \u201cI remember thinking about that boy with the screw in his belly button for days and days, trying to find the sense in it.\u201d\nMarten frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s a cruel trick to play on a boy.\u201d The comment surprised me. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d", "\u201cTricking you just to get a little peace and quiet. It\u2019s a shabby thing to do.\u201d\nI was taken aback. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t done in meanness. I enjoyed it. It gave me something to think about.\u201d\n\u201cBut it was pointless. Impossible.\u201d\n\u201cNot pointless.\u201d I protested. \u201cIt\u2019s the questions we can\u2019t answer that teach us the most. They teach us how to think. If you give a man an answer, all he gains is a little fact. But give him a question and he\u2019ll look for his own answers.\u201d\nI spread my blanket on the ground and folded over the threadbare tinker\u2019s cloak to wrap myself in. \u201cThat way, when he finds the answers, they\u2019ll be precious to him. The harder the question, the harder we hunt. The harder we hunt, the more we learn. An impossible question . . .\u201d\nI trailed off as realization burst onto me. Elodin. That is what Elodin had been doing. Everything he\u2019d done in his class. The games, the hints, the cryptic riddling. They were all questions of a sort.\nMarten shook his head and wandered off, but I was lost in my thoughts and hardly noticed. I had wanted answers, and in spite of all I had thought, Elodin had been trying to give them to me. What I had taken as a malicious crypticism on his part was actually a persistent urging toward the truth. I sat there, silent and stunned by the scope of his instruction. By my lack of understanding. My lack of sight.", "CHAPTER EIGHTY-FOUR\nThe Edge of the Map\nWE CONTINUED TO INCH our way through the Eld. Every day began with the hope of finding traces of a trail. Every night ended with disappointment.\nThe shine was definitely off the apple, and our group was slowly being overtaken by irritation and backbiting. Any fear Dedan once felt for me had worn paper-thin, and he pushed at me constantly. He wanted to buy a bottle of brand using the Maer\u2019s purse. I refused. He thought we didn\u2019t need to keep nightly watches, merely set up a tripline. I disagreed.\nEvery small battle I won made him resent me more. And his low grumbling steadily increased as our search wore on. It was never anything so bold as a direct confrontation, just a sporadic peppering of snide comments and sulky insubordination.\nOn the other hand, Tempi and I were slowly moving toward something like friendship. His Aturan was becoming better, and my Ademic had progressed to the point where I could actually be considered inarticulate, as opposed to just confusing.\nI continued to mimic Tempi as he performed his dance, and he continued to ignore me. Now that I\u2019d been doing it for a while, I recognized a hint of martial flavor to it. A slow motion with one arm gave the impression of a punch, a glacial raising of the foot resembled a kick. My arms and legs no longer shook from the effort of moving slowly along with him, but I was still irritated by how clumsy I was. I hate nothing so much as doing a thing badly.\nFor example, there was a portion halfway through that looked easy as breathing. Tempi turned, circled his arms, and took a small step. But whenever I tried to do the same, I inevitably found myself stumbling. I had tried a half-dozen different ways of placing my feet, but nothing made any difference.\nBut the day after I told my \u201cloose screw\u201d story, as Dedan eventually came to refer to it, Tempi stopped ignoring me. This time after I stumbled, he stopped and faced me. His fingers flicked: Disapproval, irritation. \u201cGo", "back,\u201d he said settling into the dance position that came before my stumble. I went into the same position and tried to mimic him. I lost my balance\nagain, and had to shuffle my feet to keep from stumbling. \u201cMy feet are stupid,\u201d I muttered in Ademic, curling the fingers on my left hand: Embarrassment.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Tempi grabbed my hips in his hands and twisted them. Then he pushed my shoulders back, and slapped at my knee, making me bend it. \u201cYes.\u201d\nI tried moving forward again, and felt the difference. I still lost my balance, but only a little.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said again. \u201cWatch.\u201d He tapped his shoulder. \u201cThis.\u201d He stood directly in front of me, barely a foot away, and repeated the motion. He turned, his hands made a circle to the side, and his shoulder pushed into my chest. It was the same motion you would make if you were trying to push open a door with your shoulder.\nTempi wasn\u2019t moving very quickly, but his shoulder pushed me firmly aside. It wasn\u2019t rough or sudden, but the force of it was irresistible, like when a horse brushes up against you on a crowded street.\nI moved through it again, focusing on my shoulder. I didn\u2019t stumble.\nSince we were the only ones at the camp, I kept the smile from my face and gestured: Happiness. \u201cThank you.\u201d Understatement.\nTempi said nothing. His face was blank, his hands still. He merely went back to where he had stood before and began his dance again from the beginning, facing away from me.\nI tried to remain stoic about the exchange, but I took this as a great compliment. Had I known more about the Adem, I would have realized it was far more than that.\nTempi and I came over a rise to find Marten waiting for us. It was too early for lunch, so hope rose in my chest as I thought that finally, after all these long days of searching, he might have caught the bandits\u2019 trail.\n\u201cI wanted to show you this,\u201d Marten said, gesturing to a tall, sprawling, fernlike plant that stood a dozen feet away. \u201cA bit of a rare thing. Been years since I\u2019ve seen one.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s called An\u2019s blade,\u201d he said proudly, looking it over. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to keep an eye out. Not many folk know about them so it might give us a clue if there are any more of them about.\u201d\nMarten looked back and forth between us eagerly. \u201cWell?\u201d he said at last. \u201cWhat\u2019s so special about it?\u201d I asked dutifully.\nMarten smiled. \u201cThe An\u2019s blade is interesting because it can\u2019t tolerate\nfolk,\u201d he said. \u201cIf any part of it touches your skin, it\u2019ll turn red as fall leaves in a couple hours. Redder than that. Bright as your mercenary reds,\u201d Marten gestured to Tempi. \u201cAnd then that whole plant will dry up and die.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d I asked, no longer having to feign interest.\nMarten nodded. \u201cA drop of sweat will kill it just the same. Which means most times it will die just from touching a person\u2019s clothes. Armor too. Or a stick you\u2019ve been holding. Or a sword.\u201d He gestured to Tempi\u2019s hip. \u201cSome people say it will die if you so much as breathe on it,\u201d Marten said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the truth.\u201d\nMarten turned to lead us away from the An\u2019s blade. \u201cThis is an old, old piece of forest. You don\u2019t see the blade anywhere near where folk have settled. We\u2019re off the edge of the map here.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re hardly on the edge of the map,\u201d I said. \u201cWe know exactly where we are.\u201d\nMarten snorted. \u201cMaps don\u2019t just have outside edges. They have inside edges. Holes. Folk like to pretend they know everything about the world. Rich folk especially. Maps are great for that. On this side of the line is Baron Taxtwice\u2019s field, on that side is Count Uptemuny\u2019s land.\u201d\nMarten spat. \u201cYou can\u2019t have blanks on your maps, so the folks who draw them shade in a piece and write, \u2018The Eld.\u2019 \u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou might as well burn a hole right through the map for what good that does. This forest is big as Vintas. Nobody owns it. You head off in the wrong direction in here, you\u2019ll walk a hundred miles and never see a road, let alone a house or plowed field. There are places around here that have never felt the press of a man\u2019s foot or heard the sound of his voice.\u201d\nI looked around. \u201cIt looks the same as most other forests I\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\u201cA wolf looks like a dog,\u201d Marten said simply.\u201cBut it\u2019s not. A dog is . . .\u201d He paused. \u201cWhat\u2019s that word for animals that are around people all the time? Cows and sheep and such.\u201d\n\u201cDomesticated?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he said, looking around. \u201cA farm is domesticated. A garden. A park. Most forests too. Folks hunt mushrooms, or cut firewood, or take their sweethearts for a little rub and cuddle.\u201d\nHe shook his head and reached out to touch the rough bark of a nearby tree. The gesture was oddly gentle, almost loving. \u201cNot this place. This place is old and wild. It doesn\u2019t care one thin sliver of a damn about us. If these folk we\u2019re hunting get the jump on us, they won\u2019t even have to bury our bodies. We\u2019ll lie on the ground for a hundred years and no one will come close to stumbling on our bones.\u201d\nI turned where I stood, looking at the rise and fall of the land. The worn rocks, the endless ranks of trees. I tried not to think about how the Maer had sent me here, like moving a stone on a tak board. He had sent me to a hole in the map. A place where no one would ever find my bones.", "CHAPTER EIGHTY-FIVE\nInterlude\u2014Fences\nKVOTHE SAT UPRIGHT IN his seat, craning his neck to get a better look out the window. He was just holding his hand up to Chronicler when they heard a quick, light tapping on the wooden landing outside. Too fast and soft to be the heavy boots of farmers, it was followed by a high peal of childish laughter.\nChronicler quickly blotted the page he was writing, then tucked it under a stack of blank paper as Kvothe got to his feet and walked toward the bar. Bast leaned back, tipping his chair onto two legs.\nAfter a moment, the door opened and a young man with broad shoulders and a thin beard stepped into the inn, carefully ushering a little blonde girl through the doorway ahead of him. Behind him a young woman carried a baby boy sitting on her arm.\nThe innkeeper smiled, raising a hand. \u201cMary! Hap!\u201d\nThe young couple exchanged a brief word before the tall farmer walked over to Chronicler, still gently ushering the little girl in front of him. Bast got to his feet and offered up his chair to Hap.\nMary approached the bar, casually untangling one of the little boy\u2019s hands from her hair. She was young and pretty, with a smiling mouth and tired eyes. \u201cHello Kote.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you two in a long while,\u201d the innkeeper said. \u201cCan I get you some cider? I pressed it fresh this morning.\u201d\nShe nodded, and the innkeeper poured three mugs. Bast carried two over to Hap and his daughter. Hap took his, but the little girl hid behind her father, peering shyly around his shoulder.\n\u201cWould young master Ben like his own cup?\u201d Kote asked.\n\u201cHe would,\u201d Mary said, smiling at the boy as he chewed on his fingers. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t give it to him unless you\u2019re eager to clean the floors.\u201d She reached into her pocket.\nKote shook his head firmly, holding up a hand. \u201cI won\u2019t hear of it,\u201d he", "said. \u201cHap didn\u2019t take half of what the work was worth when he fixed my fences out back.\u201d\nMary smiled a tired, anxious smile and picked up her mug. \u201cThank you kindly, Kote.\u201d She walked over to where her husband sat, talking to Chronicler. She spoke to the scribe, swaying gently back and forth, bouncing the baby on one hip. Her husband nodded along, occasionally interjecting a word or two. Chronicler dipped his pen and began to write.\nBast moved back to the bar and leaned against it, eyeing the far table curiously. \u201cI still don\u2019t understand all of this,\u201d he said. \u201cI know for a fact Mary can write. She\u2019s sent me letters.\u201d\nKvothe looked curiously at his student, then shrugged. \u201cI expect he\u2019s writing wills and dispositions, not letters. You want that sort of thing done in a clear hand, spelled properly and with no confusion.\u201d He motioned to where Chronicler was pressing a heavy seal onto a sheet of paper. \u201cSee? That shows he\u2019s a court official. Everything he witnesses has legal weight.\u201d\n\u201cBut the priest does that,\u201d Bast said. \u201cAbbe Grimes is all sorts of official. He writes the marriage records and the deed when someone buys a plot of land. You said yourself, they love their records.\u201d\nKvothe nodded. \u201cTrue, but a priest likes it when you leave money to the church. If he writes up your will and you don\u2019t give the church as much as a bent penny . . .\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThat can make life hard in a little town like this. And if you can\u2019t read . . . well, then the priest can write down whatever he wants, can\u2019t he? And who\u2019s to argue with him after you\u2019re dead?\u201d\nBast looked shocked. \u201cAbbe Grimes wouldn\u2019t do something like that!\u201d\n\u201cHe probably wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Kvothe conceded. \u201cGrimes is a decent sort for a priest. But maybe you want to leave a piece of land to the young widow down the lane and some money to her second son?\u201d Kvothe raised an eyebrow meaningfully. \u201cThat\u2019s the sort of thing a fellow doesn\u2019t care to have his priest writing down. Better to have that news come out after you\u2019re dead and buried deep.\u201d\nUnderstanding came into Bast\u2019s eyes and he looked at the young couple as if trying to guess what secrets they were trying to hide.\nKvothe pulled out a white cloth and began to polish the bar absentmindedly. \u201cMost times it\u2019s simpler than that. Some folk just want to leave Ellie the music box and not hear the other sisters wail about it for the next ten years.\u201d\n\u201cLike when the Widow Graden died?\u201d", "\u201cExactly like when Widow Graden died. You saw how that family tore itself up fighting over her things. Half of them still aren\u2019t on speaking terms.\u201d\nAcross the room, the little girl stepped close to her mother and tugged insistently on her dress. A moment later Mary came over to the bar with the little girl in tow. \u201cLittle Syl has to tend to her necessary,\u201d she said apologetically. \u201cCould we . . .?\u201d\nKote nodded and pointed to the door near the stairway.\nMary turned and held out the little boy to Bast. \u201cWould you mind?\u201d Moving mostly on reflex, Bast reached out with both hands to take hold of\nthe boy, then stood there awkwardly as Mary escorted her daughter away. The little boy looked around brightly, not sure what to make of this new\nsituation. Bast turned to face Kvothe, the baby held stiffly in front of himself. The child\u2019s expression slowly shifted from curious to uncertain to unhappy. Finally he began to make a soft, anxious noise. He looked as if he were thinking about whether or not he wanted to cry, and was slowly starting to realize that, yes, as a matter of fact, he probably did.\n\u201cOh for goodness sake, Bast,\u201d Kvothe said in an exasperated voice. \u201cHere.\u201d He stepped forward and took hold of the boy, sitting him on top of the bar and holding him steady with both hands.\nThe boy seemed happier there. He rubbed a curious hand on the smooth top of the bar, leaving a smudge. He looked at Bast and smiled. \u201cDog,\u201d he said.\n\u201cCharming,\u201d Bast said, his voice dry.\nLittle Ben began to chew on his fingers and looked around again, more purposefully this time. \u201cMam,\u201d he said. \u201cMamamama.\u201d Then he began to look concerned and make the same, low anxious noise as before.\n\u201cHold him up,\u201d Kvothe said, moving to stand directly in front of the little boy. Once Bast was steadying him, the innkeeper grabbed hold of the boy\u2019s feet and began a singsong chant.\nCobbler, cobbler, measure my feet. Farmer, farmer, plant some wheat. Baker, baker, bake me bread. Tailor, make a hat for my head.\nThe little boy watched as Kvothe made a different hand motion for each line, pretending to plant wheat and knead bread. By the final line the little", "boy was laughing a delighted, burbling laugh as he clapped his hands to his own head along with the red-haired man.\nMiller, keep your thumb off the scale. Milkmaid, milkmaid, fill your pail Potter, potter, spin a jug,\nBaby, give your daddy a hug!\nKvothe made no gesture for the last line, instead he tilted his head, eyeing Bast expectantly.\nBast merely stood there, confused. Then realization dawned on his face. \u201cReshi, how could you think that?\u201d he asked, his voice slightly offended. He pointed at the little boy. \u201cHe\u2019s blonde!\u201d\nLooking back and forth between the two men, the boy decided that he would, actually, like to have a bit of a cry. His face clouded over, and he began to wail.\n\u201cThis is your fault,\u201d Bast said flatly.\nKvothe picked the little boy up off the bar and jiggled him in a marginally successful attempt to calm him. A moment later when Mary came back into the taproom, the baby howled even louder and leaned toward her, reaching with both hands.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Kvothe said, sounding abashed.\nMary took him back and he went instantly quiet, tears still standing in his eyes. \u201cNone of yours,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s just mother-hungry lately.\u201d She touched her nose to his, smiling, and the baby gave another delighted, burbling laugh.\n\u201cHow much did you charge them?\u201d Kvothe asked as he walked back to Chronicler\u2019s table.\nChronicler shrugged. \u201cPenny and a half.\u201d\nKvothe paused in the act of sitting down. His eyes narrowed. \u201cThat won\u2019t cover the cost of your paper.\u201d\nChronicler asked. \u201cI have ears, don\u2019t I? The smith\u2019s prentice mentioned the Bentleys are on hard times. Even if he hadn\u2019t, I still have eyes. Fellow\u2019s got\n \nseams on both knees and boots worn nearly through. Little girl\u2019s dress is too short for her and half patches besides.\u201d\nKvothe nodded, his expression grim. \u201cTheir south field\u2019s been flooded out two years running. And they had both their goats die this spring. Even if these were good times it would be a bad year for them. With their new little boy . . .\u201d He drew a long breath and let it out in a long, pensive sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s the levy taxes. Two this year already.\u201d\n\u201cDo you want me to wreck the fence again, Reshi?\u201d Bast said eagerly.\n\u201cHush about that, Bast.\u201d A smile flickered around the edges of Kvothe\u2019s mouth. \u201cWe\u2019ll need something different this time.\u201d His smile faded. \u201cBefore the next levy.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe there won\u2019t be another,\u201d Chronicler said.\nKvothe shook his head. \u201cIt won\u2019t come until after the harvest, but it\u2019ll come. Regular taxmen are bad enough, but they know enough to occasionally look the other way. They know they\u2019ll be back next year, and the year after. But the bleeders . . .\u201d\nChronicler nodded. \u201cThey\u2019re different,\u201d he said grimly. Then recited, \u201c\u2018If they could, they\u2019d take the rain. If they can\u2019t get gold, they\u2019ll take the grain.\u2019 \u201d\nKvothe gave a thin smile and continued.\nIf you\u2019ve got no grain, they\u2019ll take your goat. They\u2019ll take your firewood and your coat.\nIf you\u2019ve a cat, they\u2019ll take your mouse.\nAnd in the end, they\u2019ll take your house.\n\u201cEveryone hates the bleeders,\u201d Chronicler agreed darkly. \u201cIf anything, the nobles hate them twice as much.\u201d\n\u201cI find that hard to believe,\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cYou should hear the talk around here. If the last one hadn\u2019t had a full armed guard, I don\u2019t think he would have made it out of town alive.\u201d\nChronicler gave a bent smile. \u201cYou should have heard the things my father used to call them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he\u2019d only had two levies in twenty years. He said he\u2019d rather have locusts followed by a fire than the king\u2019s bleeder moving through his lands.\u201d Chronicler glanced at the door of the inn. \u201cThey\u2019re too proud to ask for help?\u201d\n\u201cProuder than that,\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cThe poorer you are, the more your pride", "is worth. I know the feeling. I never could have asked a friend for money. I would have starved first.\u201d\n\u201cA loan?\u201d Chronicler asked.\n\u201cWho has money to lend these days?\u201d Kvothe asked grimly. \u201cIt\u2019s already going to be a hungry winter for most folk. But after a third levy tax the Bentleys will be sharing blankets and eating their seed grain before the snow thaws. That\u2019s if they don\u2019t lose their house as well. . . .\u201d\nThe innkeeper looked down at his hands on the table and seemed surprised that one of them was curled into a fist. He opened it slowly and spread both hands flat against the tabletop. Then he looked up at Chronicler, a rueful smile on his face. \u201cDid you know I never paid taxes before I came here? The Edema don\u2019t own property, as a rule.\u201d He gestured at the inn. \u201cI never understood how galling it was. Some smug bastard with a ledger comes into town, makes you pay for the privilege of owning something.\u201d\nKvothe gestured for Chronicler to pick up his pen. \u201cNow, of course, I understand the truth of things. I know what sort of dark desires lead a group of men to wait beside the road, killing tax collectors in open defiance of the king.\u201d", "CHAPTER EIGHTY-SIX\nThe Broken Road\nWE FINISHED SEARCHING THE north side of the king\u2019s highway and started on the southern half. Often the only thing that marked one day from the next were the stories we told around the fire at night. Stories of Oren Velciter, Laniel Young-Again, and Illien. Stories of helpful swineherds and the luck of tinker\u2019s sons. Stories of demons and faeries, of riddle games and barrow draugs.\nThe Edema Ruh know all the stories in the world, and I am Edema down to the center of my bones. My parents told stories around the fire every night while I was young. I grew up watching stories in dumbshow, listening to them in songs, and acting them out on stage.\nGiven this, it was hardly surprising that I already knew the stories Dedan, Hespe, and Marten told at night. Not every detail, but I knew the bones of them. I knew their shapes and how they would end.\nDon\u2019t mistake me. I still enjoyed them. Stories don\u2019t need to be new to bring you joy. Some stories are like familiar friends. Some are dependable as bread.\nStill, a story I haven\u2019t heard before is a rare and precious thing. And after twenty days of searching the Eld, I was rewarded with one of those.\n\u201cOnce, long ago and far from here,\u201d Hespe said as we sat around the fire after dinner, \u201cthere was a boy named Jax, and he fell in love with the moon.\n\u201cJax was a strange boy. A thoughtful boy. A lonely boy. He lived in an old house at the end of a broken road. He\u2014\u201d\nDedan interrupted. \u201cDid you say a broken road?\u201d\nHespe\u2019s mouth went firm. She didn\u2019t scowl exactly, but it looked like she was getting all the pieces of a scowl together in one place, just in case she\n \nneeded them in a hurry. \u201cI did. A broken road. That\u2019s how my mother told this story a hundred times when I was little.\u201d\nFor a minute it looked like Dedan was going to ask another question. But instead he showed a rare foresight and simply nodded.\nHespe reluctantly put the pieces of her scowl away. Then she looked down at her hands, frowning. Her mouth moved silently for a moment, then she nodded to herself and continued.\nEveryone who saw Jax could tell there was something different about him. He didn\u2019t play. He didn\u2019t run around getting into trouble. And he never laughed.\nSome folk said, \u201cWhat can you expect of a boy who lives alone in a broken house at the end of a broken road?\u201d Some said the problem was that he never had any parents. Some said he had a drop of faerie blood in him and that kept his heart from ever knowing joy.\nHe was an unlucky boy. There was no denying that. When he got a new shirt, he would tear a hole in it. If you gave him a sweet, he would drop it in the road.\nSome said the boy was born under a bad star, that he was cursed, that he had a demon riding his shadow. Other folks simply felt bad for him, but not so bad that they cared to help.\nOne day, a tinker came down the road to Jax\u2019s house. This was something of a surprise, because the road was broken, so nobody ever used it.\n\u201cHoy there, boy!\u201d the tinker shouted, leaning on his stick. \u201cCan you give an old man a drink?\u201d\nJax brought out some water in a cracked clay mug. The tinker drank and looked down at the boy. \u201cYou don\u2019t look happy, son. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201cNothing is the matter,\u201d Jax said. \u201cIt seems to me a person needs something to be happy about, and I don\u2019t have any such thing.\u201d\nJax said this in a tone so flat and resigned that it broke the tinker\u2019s heart. \u201cI\u2019m betting I have something in my pack that will make you happy,\u201d he said to the boy. \u201cWhat do you say to that?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d say that if you make me happy, I\u2019ll be grateful indeed,\u201d Jax said. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t got any money to spend, not a penny to borrow to beg or to lend.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell that is a problem,\u201d said the tinker. \u201cI am in business, you see.\u201d\n\u201cIf you can find something in your pack that will make me happy,\u201d Jax said. \u201cI will give you my house. It\u2019s old and broken, but it\u2019s worth something.\u201d\nThe tinker looked up at the huge old house, one short step away from being a mansion. \u201cIt is at that,\u201d he said.\nThen Jax looked up at the tinker, his small face serious. \u201cAnd if you can\u2019t make me happy, what then? Will you give me the packs off your back, the stick in your hand, and the hat off your head?\u201d\nNow the tinker was fond of a wager, and he knew a good bet when he heard one. Besides, his packs were bulging with treasures from all over the Four Corners, and he was confident he could impress a small boy. So he agreed, and the two of them shook hands.\nFirst the tinker brought out a bag of marbles all the colors of sunlight. But they didn\u2019t make Jax happy. The tinker brought out a ball and cup. But that didn\u2019t make Jax happy.\n\u201cBall and cup doesn\u2019t make anyone happy,\u201d Marten muttered. \u201cThat\u2019s the worst toy ever. Nobody in their right mind enjoys ball and cup.\u201d\nThe tinker went through his first pack. It was full of ordinary things that would have pleased an ordinary boy: dice, puppets, a folding knife, a rubber ball. But nothing made Jax happy.\nSo the tinker moved on to his second pack. It held rarer things. A gear soldier that marched if you wound him. A bright set of paints with four different brushes. A book of secrets. A piece of iron that fell from the sky. . . .\nThis went on all day and late into the night, and eventually the tinker began to worry. He wasn\u2019t worried about losing his stick. But his packs were how he made his living, and he was rather fond of his hat.\nEventually, he realized he was going to have to open his third pack. It was small, and it only had three items in it. But they were things he only showed to his wealthiest customers. Each was worth much more than a broken house. But still, he thought, better to lose one than to lose everything and his hat besides.\nJust as the tinker was reaching for his third pack, Jax pointed. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\n\u201cThose are spectacles,\u201d the tinker said. \u201cThey\u2019re a second pair of eyes that help a person see better.\u201d He picked them up and settled them onto Jax\u2019s face.", "Jax looked around. \u201cThings look the same,\u201d he said. Then he looked up. \u201cWhat are those?\u201d\n\u201cThose are stars,\u201d the tinker said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen them before.\u201d He turned, still looking up. Then he stopped stock still. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\n\u201cThat is the moon,\u201d the tinker said.\n\u201cI think that would make me happy,\u201d Jax said.\n\u201cWell there you go,\u201d the tinker said, relieved. \u201cYou have your spectacles. .\n. .\u201d\n\u201cLooking at it doesn\u2019t make me happy,\u201d Jax said. \u201cNo more than looking\nat my dinner makes me full. I want it. I want to have it for my own.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t give you the moon,\u201d the tinker said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t belong to me.\nShe belongs only to herself.\u201d\n\u201cOnly the moon will do,\u201d Jax said.\n\u201cWell I can\u2019t help you with that,\u201d the tinker said with a heavy sigh. \u201cMy\npacks and everything in them are yours.\u201d\nJax nodded, unsmiling.\n\u201cAnd here\u2019s my stick. A good sturdy one it is, too.\u201d\nJax took it in his hand.\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose,\u201d the tinker said reluctantly, \u201cthat you\u2019d mind leaving me\nwith my hat? I\u2019m rather fond of it. . . .\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s mine by right,\u201d Jax said. \u201cIf you were fond of it, you shouldn\u2019t have\ngambled it away.\u201d The tinker scowled as he handed over his hat.\nTempi made a low noise in his throat and shook his head. Hespe smiled and nodded. Apparently even the Adem know it\u2019s bad luck to be rude to a tinker.\nSo Jax settled the hat on his head, took the stick in his hand, and gathered up the tinker\u2019s packs. When he found the third one, still unopened, he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s in here?\u201d\n\u201cSomething for you to choke on,\u201d the tinker spat.\n\u201cNo need to get tetchy over a hat,\u201d the boy said. \u201cI have greater need of it than you. I have a long way to walk if I\u2019m to find the moon and make her mine.\u201d\n\u201cBut for the taking of my hat, you could have had my help in catching her,\u201d the tinker said.\n\u201cI will leave you with the broken house,\u201d Jax said. \u201cThat is something. Though it will be up to you to mend it.\u201d", "Jax put the spectacles on his face and started walking down the road in the direction of the moon. He walked all night, only stopping when she went out of sight behind the mountains.\nSo Jax walked day after day, endlessly searching\u2014\nDedan snorted. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that sound just a little too familiar?\u201d he muttered loud enough for everyone to hear. \u201cI wonder if he was pissing his time up a tree like we are?\u201d\nHespe glared at him, the muscles in her jaw clenching.\nI gave a quiet sigh.\n\u201cAre you done?\u201d Hespe asked pointedly, glaring at Dedan for a long\nmoment.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Dedan asked.\n\u201cShut up while I\u2019m telling my story is what,\u201d Hespe said.\n\u201cEveryone else had their say!\u201d Dedan climbed to his feet, indignant. \u201cEven\nthe mute chimed in.\u201d He waved a hand at Tempi. \u201cHow come I\u2019m the only one you get hissy at?\u201d\nHespe seethed for a moment, then said. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to pick a fight halfway through my story is why.\u201d\n\u201cTellin\u2019 the truth isn\u2019t picking a fight,\u201d Dedan grumbled. \u201cSomeone needs to speak some sense around here.\u201d\nHespe threw her hands up in the air, \u201cYou\u2019re still doing it! Can\u2019t you set it down for one evening? Every chance you get you have to bitch and minge on!\u201d\n\u201cAt least when I don\u2019t agree I speak my mind,\u201d Dedan said. \u201cI don\u2019t take the coward\u2019s way out.\u201d\nHespe\u2019s eyes flashed, and despite my better judgment, I decided to jump in. \u201cFine,\u201d I interrupted, looking at Dedan. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a better idea for finding these folk, let\u2019s hear it. Let\u2019s talk it over like adults.\u201d\nMy interjection didn\u2019t slow Dedan down the least bit. It just pointed him in my direction. \u201cWhat would you know about adults?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of being talked down to by some boy who probably doesn\u2019t even have hair on his balls yet.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure if the Maer had known how hairy your balls were, he would have\n \nput you in charge,\u201d I said with what I hoped was infuriating calmness. \u201cUnfortunately, it seems he missed that fact and decided on me instead.\u201d\nDedan drew a breath, but Tempi broke in before he could start. \u201cBalls,\u201d the Adem said curiously. \u201cWhat is balls?\u201d\nAll the air went out of Dedan in a rush, and he turned to look at Tempi, half irritated, half amused. The big mercenary chuckled and made a very clear motion between his legs with a cupped hand. \u201cYou know. Balls,\u201d he said without a trace of self-consciousness.\nBehind his back, Hespe rolled her eyes, shaking her head.\n\u201cAh,\u201d Tempi said, nodding to show his understanding. \u201cWhy is the Maer looking at hairy balls?\u201d\nA pause, then a storm of laughter rolled through our camp, exploding with all the force of the pent-up tension that had been ready to boil into a fight. Hespe laughed herself breathless, clutching at her stomach. Marten wiped tears from his eyes. Dedan laughed so hard he couldn\u2019t stand upright and ended up crouching with one hand on the ground to steady himself.\nBy the end of it, everyone was sitting around the fire, breathing hard and grinning like silly idiots. The tension that had been thick as winter fog was gone for the first time in days. It was only then that Tempi briefly caught my eye. His thumb and forefinger rubbed together gently. Gladness? No. Satisfaction . Realization dawned on me as I met his eye again, his expression was blank as always. Studiously blank. So blank it was almost smug.\n\u201cCan we get back to your story, love?\u201d Dedan asked Hespe. \u201cI\u2019d like to know how this boy gets the moon into bed.\u201d\nHespe smiled at him, the first honest smile I\u2019d seen her give Dedan in a handful of days. \u201cI\u2019ve lost my place,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a rhythm to it, like a song. I can tell it from the beginning, but if I start halfway through I\u2019ll get it all tangled up in my head.\u201d\n\u201cWill you start over tomorrow if I promise to keep my mouth shut?\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d she agreed, \u201cif you promise.\u201d", "CHAPTER EIGHTY-SEVEN\nThe Lethani\nTHE NEXT DAY TEMPI and I went to Crosson for supplies. It meant a long day of walking, but not having to look for trail sign every step of the way made it feel like we were flying down the road.\nAs we walked, Tempi and I traded words back and forth. I learned the word for dream, and smell, and bone. I learned there were different words in Ademic for iron and sword-iron.\nThen we had a long hour\u2019s worth of fruitless conversation as he tried to help me understand what it meant when he rubbed his fingers over his eyebrow. It almost seemed to be the same thing as a shrug, but he made it clear it wasn\u2019t the same. Was it indifference? Ambiguity?\n\u201cIs it the feeling you have when someone offers you a choice?\u201d I tried again. \u201cSomeone offers you an apple or a plum?\u201d I held up both hands in front of myself. \u201cBut you like both the same.\u201d I pressed my fingers together and smoothed them over my eyebrow twice. \u201cThis feeling?\u201d\nTempi shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d He stopped walking for a moment, then resumed. At his side, his left hand said: Dishonesty. \u201cWhat is plum?\u201d Attentive.\nConfused, I looked at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cWhat does plum mean?\u201d He gestured again: Profoundly serious. Attentive.\nI turned my attention to the trees and immediately heard it: movement in the undergrowth.\nThe noise came from the south side of the road. The side we hadn\u2019t searched yet. The bandits. Excitement and fear swelled in my chest. Would they attack us? In my tatty cloak I doubted I looked like much of a target, but I was carrying my lute in its dark, expensive case.\nTempi had changed back to his tight mercenary reds for the trip into town. Would that discourage a man with a longbow? Or would it seem I was a minstrel rich enough to hire an Adem bodyguard? We might look like fruit", "ripe for the picking.\nI thought longingly of the arrowcatch I\u2019d sold to Kilvin, and realized he\u2019d\nbeen right. People would pay dearly for them. I\u2019d give every penny in my pocket for one right now.\nI gestured to Tempi: Acceptance. Dishonesty. Agreement. \u201cA plum is a sweet fruit,\u201d I said, straining my ears for telltale sounds from the surrounding trees.\nShould we run to the trees for cover, or would it be better to pretend we were unaware of them? What could I do if they attacked? I had the knife I\u2019d bought from the tinker on my belt, but I had no idea how to use it. I was suddenly aware of how terribly unprepared I was. What in God\u2019s name was I doing out here? I didn\u2019t belong in this situation. Why had the Maer sent me?\nJust as I was starting to sweat in earnest, I heard a sudden snap and rustle in the underbrush. A horned hart burst from the trees and was across the road in three easy bounds. A moment later, two hinds followed. One paused in the center of the road and turned to look at us curiously, her long ear twitching. Then she was off and lost among the trees.\nMy heart was racing, and I let out a low, nervous laugh. I turned to look at Tempi, only to find him with his sword drawn. The fingers of his left hand curled into embarrassment, then made several quick gestures I couldn\u2019t identify.\nHe sheathed the sword without a flourish of any sort. A gesture as casual as putting your hand in your pocket. Frustration.\nI nodded. Glad as I was to not be sprouting arrows from my back, an ambush would at least have given us a clue as to where the bandits were. Agreement. Understatement.\nWe silently continued our walk toward Crosson.\nCrosson wasn\u2019t much as far as towns go. Twenty or thirty buildings with thick forest on every side. If it hadn\u2019t been on the king\u2019s highway, it probably wouldn\u2019t even have warranted a name.\nBut since it was on the king\u2019s highway, there was a reasonably stocked general goods store that supplied travelers and the scattering of nearby farms. There was a small post station that was also a livery and a farrier, and a small\n \nchurch that was also a brewery.\nAnd an inn, of course. While the Laughing Moon was barely a third the\nsize of the Pennysworth, it was still several steps above what you\u2019d expect for a town like this. It was two stories tall, with three private rooms and a bathhouse. A large handpainted sign showed a gibbous moon wearing a waistcoat, holding its belly while it rocked with laughter.\nI\u2019d brought my lute that morning, hoping I might be able to play in exchange for a bit of lunch. But that was just an excuse. I was desperate for any excuse to play. My enforced silence was wearing on me as much as Dedan\u2019s muttering. I hadn\u2019t gone so long without my music since I\u2019d been homeless on the streets of Tarbean.\nTempi and I dropped off our list of supplies with the elderly woman who ran the store. Four large loaves of trail bread, a half-pound of butter, quarterpound of salt, flour, dried apple, sausages, a side of bacon, a sack of turnips, six eggs, two buttons, feathers for refletching Marten\u2019s hunting arrows, bootlaces, soap, and a new whetstone to replace one Dedan had broken. All told, it would come to eight silver bits from the Maer\u2019s rapidly thinning purse.\nTempi and I made our way over to the inn for lunch, knowing it would be an hour or two before our order was ready. Surprisingly, I could hear noise from the taproom from across the street. Places like this were usually busy in the evening when travelers stopped for the night, not in the middle of the day when everyone was in the fields or on the road.\nThe room quieted when we opened the door. At first I hoped the customers were glad to see a musician, then I saw their eyes were all for Tempi in his tight mercenary reds.\nThere were fifteen or twenty people idling in the taproom. Some hunched at the bar, others clustered around tables. It wasn\u2019t so crowded we couldn\u2019t find a table to sit, but it did take a couple minutes before the single harassed- looking serving girl came to our table.\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll it be then?\u201d she asked, brushing a sweaty strand of hair away from her face. \u201cWe\u2019ve got pea soup with bacon in, and a bread pudding.\u201d\n\u201cSounds lovely,\u201d I said. \u201cCan we get some apples and cheese too?\u201d \u201cDrink?\u201d\n\u201cSoft cider for me,\u201d I said.\n\u201cBeer,\u201d Tempi said, then made a gesture with two fingers on the tabletop.\n\u201cSmall whiskey. Good whiskey.\u201d", "She nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll need to see your money.\u201d\nI raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019ve had trouble lately?\u201d\nShe sighed and rolled her eyes.\nI handed her three halfpennies, and she hurried off. By then I was sure I\nwasn\u2019t imagining it: the men in the room were giving Tempi dark looks.\nI turned to a man at the table next to us, quietly eating his bowl of soup. \u201cIs\nthis a market day or something?\u201d\nHe looked at me like I was an idiot, and I saw he had a bruise going purple\non his jaw. \u201cThere\u2019s no market day in Crosson. There\u2019s no market.\u201d\n\u201cI came through here a while back and things were quiet. What\u2019s everyone\ndoing here?\u201d\n\u201cSame thing as always,\u201d he said. \u201cLooking for work. Crosson is the last\nstop before the Eld gets good and thick. A smart caravan\u2019ll pick up an extra guard or two.\u201d He took a drink. \u201cBut too many folk been gettin\u2019 feathered off in the trees lately. Caravans aren\u2019t coming through so often.\u201d\nI looked around the room. They weren\u2019t wearing any armor, but now that I was looking I could see the marks of mercenary life on most of them. They were rougher looking than ordinary townsfolk. More scars, more broken noses, more knives, more swagger.\nThe man dropped his spoon into his empty bowl and got to his feet. \u201cYou can have the place for all I care,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ve been here six days and only seen four wagons come through. Besides, only an idiot would head north as a pay-a-day.\u201d\nHe picked up a large pack and slipped it over his shoulders. \u201cAnd with all the folk gone missing, only an idiot would take on extra help in a place like this. I\u2019ll tell you this for free, half of these reeking bastards would probably cut your throat the first night on the road.\u201d\nA broad-shouldered man with a wild black beard let loose a mocking laugh from where he stood at the bar. \u201cJust because yeh can\u2019t roll dice dinna make me a criminal, souee,\u201d he said with a thick northern accent. \u201cYeh say sommat like that agin and I\u2019ll give\u2019e twice as much as yeh got last night. Plus intrest.\u201d\nThe fellow I\u2019d been talking to made a gesture you didn\u2019t have to be Adem to understand and headed out the door. The bearded man laughed.\nOur drinks showed up just then. Tempi drank off half his whiskey in a single swallow and let out a long, satisfied sigh, slouching down in his seat. I sipped my cider. I\u2019d been hoping to play for an hour or two in exchange for our meal. But I wasn\u2019t fool enough to play to a room composed entirely of", "frustrated mercenaries.\nI could have done it, mind you. In an hour, I could have them laughing and\nsinging. In two hours I could have them crying into their beer and apologizing to the serving girl. But not for the price of a meal. Not unless I had no better options. This room reeked of trouble. It was a fight waiting to happen. No trouper worth his salt could fail to recognize that.\nThe broad-shouldered man picked up a wooden mug and sauntered with theatrical casualness over to our table where he pulled out a chair for himself. He smiled a wide, insincere smile through his thick black beard and stuck his hand out in Tempi\u2019s direction. \u201cHullo there,\u201d he said loud enough for everyone in the bar to hear. \u201cM\u2019 name\u2019s Tam. Yussef?\u201d\nTempi reached out and shook, his own hand looking small and pale gripped in the other man\u2019s huge hairy one. \u201cTempi.\u201d\nTam grinned at him. \u201cAnd what\u2019re yeh doin\u2019 in town?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re just passing through,\u201d I said. \u201cWe met up on the road and he was nice enough to walk with me.\u201d\nTam looked me up and down dismissively. \u201cI wan\u2019t talkin\u2019 to you, boy,\u201d he growled. \u201cMind yer betters.\u201d\nTempi remained silent, watching the big man with the same placid, attentive expression he always wore. I watched his left hand come up to his ear in a gesture I didn\u2019t recognize.\nTam took a drink, watching Tempi all the while. When he lowered his mug, the dark hair around his mouth was wet, and he wiped his forearm across his face to dry it. \u201cI\u2019ve always wonnert,\u201d he said, loud enough for it to carry through the whole room. \u201cYeh Adem. How much does one of yeh fancy lads make?\u201d\nTempi turned to look at me, his head tilted slightly to one side. I realized he probably couldn\u2019t understand the man\u2019s thick accent.\n\u201cHe wants to know how much money you earn,\u201d I explained.\nTempi made a wavering motion with one hand. \u201cComplicated.\u201d\nTam leaned over the table. \u201cWha if yeh were hired to guard a caravan?\nHow much would\u2019ee charge a day?\u201d\n\u201cTwo jots.\u201d Tempi shrugged. \u201cThree.\u201d\nTam gave a showy laugh, loud enough that I could smell his breath. I\u2019d\nexpected it to stink, but it didn\u2019t. It smelled like cider, sweet with mulling spices. \u201cYeh hear that boys?\u201d He shouted over his shoulder. \u201cThree jots a day. And he canna hardly talk!\u201d", "Most everyone was already watching and listening, and this piece of information brought a low, irritated murmur from the room.\nTam turned back to the table. \u201cMost of us get penny a day, when we get work at all. I get two, \u2019cause I\u2019m good with horses and can lift up the back of a wagon if I need to.\u201d He rolled his broad shoulders. \u201cAre yeh worth twenny men in a fight?\u201d\nI don\u2019t know how much of it Tempi understood, but he seemed to follow the last question fairly well. \u201cTwenty?\u201d he looked around appraisingly. \u201cNo. Four.\u201d He wavered his spread hand back and forth uncertainly. \u201cFive.\u201d\nThis did nothing to improve the atmosphere in the room. Tam shook his head in exaggerated bemusement. \u201cEven if I believed yeh for a second,\u201d he said, \u201cthat means yeh should make four or five pennies a day. Not twenny. Wh\u2014\u201d\nI put on my most ingratiating smile and leaned into the conversation. \u201cListen, I\u2014\u201d\nTam\u2019s mug knocked hard against the tabletop, sending a splash of cider leaping up into the air. He gave me a dangerous look that didn\u2019t hold any of the false playfulness he\u2019d been showing Tempi. \u201cBoy,\u201d he said. \u201cYeh innerupt me again, and I\u2019ll knock yer teeth right out.\u201d He said it without any particular emphasis, as if he were letting me know that if I jumped into the river, I was bound to get wet.\nTam turned back to Tempi. \u201cWhat makes you think you\u2019re worth three jots a day?\u201d\n\u201cWho buys me, buys this.\u201d Tempi held up his hand. \u201cAnd this.\u201d He pointed to the hilt of his sword. \u201cAnd this.\u201d He tapped a leather strap that bound his distinctive Adem reds tightly to his chest.\nThe big man slapped the table hard with the flat of his hand. \u201cSo tha\u2019s the secret!\u201d he said. \u201cI need to get me a red shirt!\u201d This brought a chuckle from the room.\nTempi shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d\nTam leaned forward, and flicked at one of the straps near Tempi\u2019s shoulder with a thick finger. \u201cAre yeh saying I\u2019m not good enough to wear a fancy red shirt like yours?\u201d He flicked the strap again.\nTempi nodded easily. \u201cYes. You are not good enough.\u201d\nTam grinned madly. \u201cWhat if I said yer mother was a whore?\u201d\nThe room grew quiet. Tempi turned to look at me. Curiosity. \u201cWhat is\nwhore?\u201d", "Unsurprisingly, that hadn\u2019t been one of the words we had shared over the last span of days. For half a moment I considered lying, but there was no way I could manage it. \u201cHe says your mother is a person men pay money to have sex with.\u201d\nTempi turned back to the mercenary and nodded graciously. \u201cYou are very kind. I thank you.\u201d\nTam\u2019s expression darkened, as if he suspected he was being mocked. \u201cYeh coward. For a bent penny I\u2019d give yeh such a kickin\u2019 you\u2019d be wearing your pecker backwards.\u201d\nTempi turned to me again. \u201cI do not understand this man,\u201d he said. \u201cIs he attempting to buy sex with me? Or does he wish to fight?\u201d\nLaughter roared through the room, and Tam\u2019s face grew red as blood under his beard.\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure he wants to fight,\u201d I said, trying to keep from laughing myself.\n\u201cAh,\u201d Tempi said. \u201cWhy does he not say? Why all of this . . .\u201d He flicked his fingers back and forth and gave me a quizzical look.\n\u201cPauncing around?\u201d I suggested. Tempi\u2019s confidence was having a relaxing effect on me, and I wasn\u2019t above getting a little dig of my own in. After seeing how easily the Adem had dealt with Dedan, I was looking forward to seeing him thump some of the arrogance out of this horse\u2019s ass.\nTempi looked back toward the big man. \u201cIf you wish to fight, now stop pauncing around.\u201d The Adem made a broad gesture to the rest of the room. \u201cGo find others to fight with you. Bring enough women to feel safe. Good?\u201d My brief moment of relaxation evaporated as Tempi turned back to me, exasperation thick in his voice. \u201cYou people are always talk.\u201d\nTam stomped back to the table where his friends sat throwing dice. \u201cArright now. Yeh heard him. The little gripshit says he\u2019s worth four of us, so let\u2019s show him the sort of damage four of us can do. Brenden, Ven, Jane, you in?\u201d\nA bald man and a tall woman came to their feet, smiling. But the third waved his hand dismissively. \u201cI\u2019m too drunk to fight proper, Tam. But that\u2019s not half as drunk as I\u2019d need to be to go up against a bloodshirt. They\u2019s bastards in a fight. I\u2019s seen it.\u201d\nI was no stranger to bar fights. You\u2019d think they\u2019d be rare in a place like the University, but liquor is the great leveler. After six or seven solid drinks, there is very little difference between a miller on the outs with his wife and a", "young alchemist who\u2019s done poorly on his exams. They\u2019re both equally eager to skin their knuckles on someone else\u2019s teeth.\nEven the Eolian, genteel as it was, saw its share of scuffles. If you stayed late enough you had a decent chance of seeing two of the embroidered nobility slapping away at each other.\nMy point is, when you\u2019re a musician you see a lot of fights. Some people go to the bars to drink. Some go to play dice. Some folk go looking for a fight, and others go hoping to watch a fight.\nFolk don\u2019t get hurt as much as you\u2019d expect. Bruises and split lips are usually the worst of it. If you\u2019re unlucky you might lose a tooth or break an arm, but there\u2019s a vast difference between a friendly bar fight and a back- alley koshing. A bar fight has rules and a host of unofficial judges standing around to enforce them. If things start to get vicious spectators are quick to leap in and break things up, because that\u2019s what you\u2019d want someone to do for you.\nThere are exceptions, of course. Accidents happen, and I knew all too well from my time at the Medica how easy it was to sprain a wrist or dislocate a finger. Those might be minor injuries to a cattle drover or an innkeeper, but to me, with so much of my livelihood relying on my clever hands, the thought of a broken thumb was terrifying.\nMy stomach knotted as I watched Tempi take another swallow of whiskey and get to his feet. The problem was that we were strangers here. If things got ugly, could I count on the irritated mercenaries to step in and put a stop to things? Three against one was nothing close to a fair fight, and if it got ugly it would get ugly fast.\nTempi took a mouthful of beer and looked at me calmly. \u201cWatch my back,\u201d he said, then turned to walk to where the other mercenaries stood.\nFor a moment I was simply impressed by his good use of Aturan. Since I\u2019d known him, he\u2019d gone from practically mute to using idiomatic speech. But that pride quickly faded as I tried to think of something I could do to stop the fight if things got out of control.\nI couldn\u2019t think of a blessed thing. I hadn\u2019t seen this coming, and I had no clever tricks up my sleeve. For lack of any better options, I drew my knife out of its sheath and held it out of sight below the level of the table. The last thing I\u2019d want to do is stab someone, but I could at least menace them with it and buy us enough time to get out the door.\nTempi gave the three mercenaries an appraising look. Tam was inches", "taller than he, with shoulders like an ox. There was a bald fellow with a scarred face and a wicked grin. Last was the blonde woman who stood a full hand taller than Tempi.\n\u201cThere is only one woman,\u201d Tempi said, looking Tam in the eye. \u201cIs enough? You may bring one more.\u201d\nThe female mercenary bristled. \u201cYou swaggercock,\u201d she spat. \u201cI\u2019ll show you what a woman can do in a fight.\u201d\nTempi nodded politely.\nHis continuing lack of concern began to relax me. I had heard the stories, of course, a single Adem mercenary defeating a dozen regular soldiers. Could Tempi really fight off these three at the same time? He certainly seemed to think so. . . .\nTempi looked at them. \u201cThis is my first fight of this sort. How does begin?\u201d\nMy palm started to sweat where I gripped the knife.\nTam stepped up so their chests were only inches apart. He loomed over Tempi. \u201cWe\u2019ll start by whipping you bloody. Then we\u2019ll give you a kicking. Then we\u2019ll come round and do it agin to make sure we didn\u2019t miss anything.\u201d As he said the last, he slammed his forehead down into Tempi\u2019s face.\nMy breath caught in my chest, and before I could get it back, the fight was over.\nWhen the bearded mercenary snapped his head forward, I had expected to see Tempi reel backward, nose broken and gushing blood. But Tam was the one who staggered backward, howling and clutching at his face, blood spurting from beneath his hands.\nTempi stepped forward, got his hand on the back of the big man\u2019s neck, and spun him effortlessly into the ground where he landed in a messy tangle of arms and legs.\nWithout a hint of hesitation, Tempi turned and kicked the blonde woman squarely in the hip, making her stagger. While she was reeling, Tempi punched her sharply in the side of the head, and she folded bonelessly to the ground.\nThat\u2019s when the bald man stepped in, arms spread like a wrestler. Quick as a snake, he got one hand on Tempi\u2019s shoulder and the other on his neck.\nI honestly can\u2019t say what happened next. There was a flurry of movement, and Tempi was left gripping the man\u2019s wrist and shoulder. The bald man snarled and struggled. But Tempi simply twisted the man\u2019s arm until he was", "bent over, staring at the floor. Then Tempi kicked the man\u2019s leg out from under him, sending him tumbling to the ground.\nAll in less time than it takes to tell it. If I hadn\u2019t been so stunned, I would have burst into applause.\nTam and the woman lay with the dead stillness of those deeply unconscious. But the bald man snarled something and began to make his way unsteadily back to his feet. Tempi stepped close, struck him in the head with casual precision, then watched the man slump limply to the ground.\nIt was, I thought idly, the most polite punch I\u2019d ever seen. It was the careful blow of a skilled carpenter pounding a nail: hard enough to drive it fully home, but not so hard as to bruise the wood around it.\nThe room was very quiet in the aftermath. Then the tall man who had refused to fight raised his mug in salute, spilling a little. \u201cGood on you!\u201d he said loudly to Tempi, laughing. \u201cNobody will think less of you if you show Tam a bit of your boot while he\u2019s down there. Lord knows he\u2019s done it enough in his day.\u201d\nTempi looked down as if considering it, then shook his head and walked quietly back to our table. All eyes were still watching him, but the looks weren\u2019t nearly as dark as before.\nTempi came back to the table. \u201cDid you watch my back?\u201d\nI looked up at him blankly, then nodded.\n\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d\nOnly then did I understand what he really meant. \u201cYour back was very\nstraight.\u201d\nApproval. \u201cYour back is not straight.\u201d He held up a flat hand, tilted to one\nside. \u201cThat is why you stumble in the Ketan. It is . . .\u201d Looking down, he trailed off, having noticed my knife half-concealed in my tatty cloak. He frowned. Actually frowned with his face. It was the first time I\u2019d seen him do it, and it was amazingly intimidating.\n\u201cWe will speak on this later,\u201d he said. At his side, he gestured: Vast disapproval.\nFeeling more chastised than if I\u2019d spent an hour on the horns, I ducked my head and put the knife away.\n \nWe had been walking quietly for hours, our packs heavy with supplies, when Tempi finally spoke. \u201cThere is a thing I must teach you.\u201d Serious.\n\u201cI am always glad to learn,\u201d I said, making the gesture I hoped meant\nearnest.\nTempi walked to the side of the road, set down his heavy pack, and sat on the grass. \u201cWe must speak of the Lethani.\u201d\nIt took all my control to not burst out into a sudden, giddy smile. I had been wanting to bring up the subject for a long while, as we were much closer than when I\u2019d first asked him. But I hadn\u2019t wanted to risk offending him again.\nI sat quietly for a moment, partly to maintain my composure, but also to let Tempi know I was treating this subject with respect. \u201cThe Lethani,\u201d I repeated carefully. \u201cYou said I must not ask of it.\u201d\n\u201cYou must not then. Now perhaps. I . . .\u201d Uncertain. \u201cI am pulled many ways. But now asking is.\u201d\nI waited for another moment to see if he would continue on his own. When he didn\u2019t, I asked the obvious question. \u201cWhat is the Lethani?\u201d\nSerious. Tempi looked at me for a long moment, then suddenly burst out laughing. \u201cI do not know. And I cannot tell you.\u201d He laughed again. Understatement. \u201cStill we must speak of it.\u201d\nI hesitated, wondering if this was one of his strange jokes that I could never seem to understand.\n\u201cIs complicated,\u201d he said. \u201cHard in my own language. Yours?\u201d Frustration. \u201cTell me what you know of the Lethani.\u201d\nI tried to think of how I could describe what I\u2019d heard of the Lethani using only the words he knew. \u201cI heard the Lethani is a secret thing that makes the Adem strong.\u201d\nTempi nodded. \u201cYes. This is true.\u201d\n\u201cThey say if you know the Lethani, you cannot lose a fight.\u201d\nAnother nod.\nI shook my head, knowing I wasn\u2019t getting my point across. \u201cThey say the\nLethani is a secret power. Adem keep their words inside.\u201d I made a gesture as if gathering things close to my body and hoarding them. \u201cThen those words are like wood in a fire. This word fire makes the Adem very strong. Very fast. Skin like iron. This is why you can fight many men and win.\u201d\nTempi looked at me intently. He made a gesture I didn\u2019t recognize. \u201cThat is mad talking,\u201d he said at last. \u201cIs that the correct word? Mad?\u201d He stuck out", "his tongue and rolled his eyes, wiggling his fingers at the side of his head.\nI couldn\u2019t help but laugh nervously at the display. \u201cYes. Mad is the word.\nAlso crazy.\u201d\n\u201cThen what you have said is mad talking and also crazy.\u201d\n\u201cBut what I saw today,\u201d I said. \u201cYour nose did not break when struck with\na man\u2019s head. That is no natural thing.\u201d\nTempi shook his head as he climbed to his feet. \u201cCome. Stand.\u201d\nI stood, and Tempi stepped close to me. \u201cStriking with the head is clever. It\nis quick. Can startle if opponent is not ready. But I am not not ready.\u201d\nHe stepped closer still, until we were almost touching chests. \u201cYou are the\nloud man,\u201d he said. \u201cYour head is hard. My nose is soft.\u201d He reached out and took hold of my head with both his hands. \u201cYou want this.\u201d He brought my head down, slowly, until my forehead pressed his nose.\nTempi let go of my head. \u201cStriking with the head is quick. For me, little time. Can I move?\u201d He moved my head down as he pulled away, and this time my forehead came into contact with his mouth instead, as if he were giving me a kiss. \u201cThis is not good. The mouth is soft.\u201d\nHe tipped my head back again. \u201cIf I am very fast . . .\u201d He took a full step back and brought my head down farther, until my forehead touched his chest. He let me go and I stood back up. \u201cThis is still not good. My chest is not soft. But this man has a head harder than many.\u201d His eyes twinkled a little, and I chuckled, realizing he had made a joke.\n\u201cSo.\u201d Tempi said, stepping back to where we were before. \u201cWhat can Tempi do?\u201d He motioned. \u201cStrike with the head. Slow. I show.\u201d\nVaguely nervous, I brought my head down slowly, as if trying to break his nose.\nMatching my slow speed, Tempi leaned forward and tucked his chin a bit. It wasn\u2019t much of a change, but this time as I brought my head down, my nose met the top of his head.\nTempi stepped back. \u201cSee? Cleverness. Not mad-thinking word fire.\u201d \u201cIt was very fast,\u201d I said, feeling slightly embarrassed. \u201cI could not see.\u201d \u201cYes. Fighting is fast. Train to be fast. Train, not word fire.\u201d\nHe gestured earnest and met my eye, a rarity for him. \u201cI tell this because\nyou are the leader. You need the knowing. If you think I have secret ways and iron skin . . .\u201d He looked away, shaking his head. Dangerous.\nWe both sat back down next to our packs.\n\u201cI heard it in a story,\u201d I said by way of explanation. \u201cA story like we tell", "around the fire at night.\u201d\n\u201cBut you,\u201d he pointed to me. \u201cYou have fire in your hands. You have . . .\u201d\nHe snapped his fingers, then made a gesture like a fire roaring up suddenly. \u201cYou have the doing of this, and you think the Adem have word fires inside?\u201d\nI shrugged. \u201cThat is why I ask of the Lethani. It seems mad, but I have seen mad things be true, and I am curious.\u201d I hesitated before asking my other question. \u201cYou said who knows the Lethani cannot lose a fight.\u201d\n\u201cYes. But not with word fires. The Lethani is a type of knowing.\u201d Tempi paused, obviously considering his words carefully. \u201cLethani is most important thing. All Adem learn. Mercenary learn twice. Shehyn learn three times. Most important. But complicated. Lethani is . . . many things. But nothing touched or pointed to. Adem spend whole lives thinking on the Lethani. Very hard.\n\u201cProblem,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not my place to teach my leader. But you are my student in language. Women teach the Lethani. I am not such. It is part of civilization and you are a barbarian.\u201d Gentle sorrow. \u201cBut you want to be civilization. And you have need of the Lethani.\u201d\n\u201cExplain it,\u201d I said. \u201cI will try to understand.\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cThe Lethani is doing right things.\u201d\nI waited patiently for him to continue. After a minute, he gestured,\nfrustration . \u201cNow you ask questions.\u201d He took a deep breath and repeated. \u201cThe Lethani is doing right things.\u201d\nI tried to think of an archetypical example of something good. \u201cSo the Lethani is giving a hungry child food to eat.\u201d\nHe made the wavering motion that meant, yes and no. \u201cThe Lethani is not doing a thing. Lethani is the thing that shows us.\u201d\n\u201cLethani means rules? Laws?\u201d\nTempi shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d He gestured to the forest around us. \u201cLaw is from outside, controlling. It is the . . . the horse mouth metal. And the head strings.\u201d Questioning.\n\u201cBridle and bit?\u201d I suggested. Motioning as if pulling a horse\u2019s head about with a pair of reins.\n\u201cYes. Law is bridle and bit. It controls from outside. The Lethani . . .\u201d He pointed between his eyes, then at his chest. \u201c. . . lives inside. Lethani helps decide. Law is made because many have no understanding of Lethani.\u201d\n\u201cSo with the Lethani a person does not need to follow the law.\u201d", "Pause. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d Frustration. He drew out his sword and held it parallel to the ground, its edge pointing up. \u201cIf you were small, walking this sword would be like the Lethani.\u201d\n\u201cPainful for feet?\u201d I asked, trying to lighten the mood a bit. Amusement.\nAnger. Disapproval. \u201cNo. Difficult to walk. Easy to fall on one side. Difficult to stay.\u201d\n\u201cThe Lethani is very straight?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Pause. \u201cWhat is it called when there is many mountain and one place for walking?\u201d\n\u201cA path? A pass?\u201d\n\u201cPass.\u201d Tempi nodded. \u201cThe Lethani is like a pass in the mountains. Bends. Complicated. Pass is easy way through. Only way through. But not easy to see. Path that is easy much times not go through mountains. Sometimes goes nowhere. Starve. Fall onto hole.\u201d\n\u201cSo the Lethani is the right way through the mountains.\u201d\nPartial agreement. Excitement. \u201cIt is the right way through the mountains. But the Lethani is also knowing the right way. Both. And mountains are not just mountains. Mountains are everything.\u201d\n\u201cSo the Lethani is civilization.\u201d\nPause. Yes and no. Tempi shook his head. Frustrated.\nI thought back to what he had said about mercenaries having to learn the\nLethani twice. \u201cIs the Lethani fighting?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo.\u201d\nHe said this with such absolute certainty that I had to ask the opposite to make sure. \u201cIs the Lethani not fighting?\u201d\n\u201cNo. One who knows the Lethani knows when to fight and not fight.\u201d Very important.\nI decided to change directions. \u201cWas it of the Lethani for you to fight today?\u201d\n\u201cYes. To show Adem is not afraid. We know with barbarians, not fighting is coward. Coward is weak. Not good for them to think. So with many watching, fight. Also, to show one Adem is worth many.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if they had won?\u201d\n\u201cThen barbarians know Tempi is not worth many.\u201d Slight amusement.\n\u201cIf they had won, would today\u2019s fight be not of the Lethani?\u201d\n\u201cNo. If you fall and break a leg in mountain pass, it is still the pass. If I fail\nwhile following the Lethani, it is still the Lethani.\u201d Serious. \u201cThis is why we", "are talking now. Today. With your knife. That was not the Lethani. It was not a right thing.\u201d\n\u201cI was afraid you would be hurt.\u201d\n\u201cThe Lethani does not put down roots in fear,\u201d he said, sounding as if he were reciting.\n\u201cWould it be the Lethani to let you be hurt?\u201d\nA shrug. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d\n\u201cWould it be of the Lethani to let you be . . .\u201d Extreme emphasis. \u201cHurt?\u201d \u201cPerhaps no. But they did not. To be first with the knife is not of the\nLethani. If you win and are first with the knife, you do not win.\u201d Vast disapproval.\nI couldn\u2019t puzzle out what he meant by the last. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThe Lethani is right action. Right way. Right time.\u201d Tempi\u2019s face suddenly lit up. \u201cThe old trader man,\u201d he said with visible enthusiasm. \u201cIn the stories with the packs. What is the word?\u201d\n\u201cTinker?\u201d\n\u201cYes. The tinker. How you must treat such men?\u201d\nI knew, but I wanted to see what the Adem thought. \u201cHow?\u201d\nHe looked at me, his fingers pressing together irritation. \u201cYou must be\nkind, and help them. And speak well. Always polite. Always.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cAnd if they offer something, you must consider buying it.\u201d Tempi made a triumphant gesture. \u201cYes! You can do many things when\nmeeting tinker. But there is only one right thing.\u201d He calmed himself a little. Caution. \u201cBut only doing is not the Lethani. First knowing, then doing. That is the Lethani.\u201d\nI thought on this for a moment. \u201cSo being polite is the Lethani?\u201d\n\u201cNot polite. Not kind. Not good. Not duty. The Lethani is none of these. Each moment. Each choice. All different.\u201d He gave me a penetrating look. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nHappiness. Approval. Tempi got to his feet, nodding. \u201cIt is good you know you do not. Good that you say. That is also of the Lethani.\u201d", "CHAPTER EIGHTY-EIGHT\nListening\nTEMPI AND I RETURNED to find the camp surprisingly cheerful. Dedan and Hespe were smiling at each other and Marten had managed to shoot a wild turkey for dinner.\nSo we ate and joked. And after the washing up was done, Hespe told her story about the boy who loved the moon, starting again at the beginning. Dedan kept his mouth miraculously shut, and I dared to hope our little group was finally, finally starting to become a team.\nJax had no trouble following the moon because in those days the moon was always full. She hung in the sky, round as a cup, bright as a candle, all unchanging.\nJax walked for days and days until his feet grew sore. He walked for months and months and his back grew tired beneath his packs. He walked for years and years and grew up tall and lean and hard and hungry.\nWhen he needed food, he traded out of the tinker\u2019s packs. When his shoes wore thin he did the same. Jax made his own way, and he grew up clever and sly.\nThrough it all, Jax thought about the moon. When he began to think he couldn\u2019t go another step, he\u2019d put on his spectacles and look up at her, round- bellied in the sky. And when he saw her he would feel a slow stirring in his chest. And in time he came to think he was in love.\nEventually the road Jax followed passed through Tinu\u00eb, as all roads do. Still he walked, following the great stone road east toward the mountains.\nThe road climbed and climbed. He ate the last of his bread and the last of his cheese. He drank the last of his water and the last of his wine. He walked for days without either, the moon growing larger in the night sky above him.\n \nJust as his strength was failing, Jax climbed over a rise and found an old man sitting in the mouth of a cave. He had a long grey beard and a long grey robe. He had no hair on the top of his head, or shoes on the bottom of his feet. His eyes were open and his mouth was closed.\nHis face lit up when he saw Jax. He came to his feet and smiled. \u201cHello, hello,\u201d he said, his voice bright and rich. \u201cYou\u2019re a long way from anywhere. How is the road to Tinu\u00eb?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s long,\u201d Jax said. \u201cAnd hard and weary.\u201d\nThe old man invited Jax to sit. He brought him water and goat\u2019s milk and fruit to eat. Jax ate hungrily, then offered the man a pair of shoes from his pack in trade.\n\u201cNo need, no need,\u201d the old man said happily, wiggling his toes. \u201cBut thanks for offering all the same.\u201d\nJax shrugged. \u201cAs you will. But what are you doing here, so far from everything?\u201d\n\u201cI found this cave when I was out chasing the wind,\u201d the old man said. \u201cI decided to stay because this place is perfect for what I do.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d Jax asked.\n\u201cI am a listener,\u201d the old man said. \u201cI listen to things to see what they have to say.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d Jax said carefully. \u201cAnd this is a good place for that?\u201d\n\u201cQuite good. Quite excellent good,\u201d the old man said. \u201cYou need to get a long ways away from people before you can learn to listen properly.\u201d He smiled. \u201cWhat brings you out to my little corner of the sky?\u201d\n\u201cI am trying to find the moon.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s easy enough,\u201d the old man said, gesturing to the sky. \u201cWe see her most every night, weather permitting.\u201d\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m trying to catch her. If I could be with her, I think I could be happy.\u201d\nThe old man looked at him seriously. \u201cYou want to catch her, do you? How long have you been chasing?\u201d\n\u201cMore years and miles than I can count.\u201d\nThe old man closed his eyes for a moment, then nodded to himself. \u201cI can hear it in your voice. This is no passing fancy.\u201d He leaned close and pressed his ear to Jax\u2019s chest. He closed his eyes for another long moment and was very still. \u201cOh,\u201d he said softly. \u201cHow sad. Your heart is broken and you\u2019ve never even had a chance to use it.\u201d", "Jax moved around, a little uncomfortable. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my asking,\u201d Jax said, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind you asking,\u201d the old man said. \u201cSo long as you don\u2019t mind me not telling. If you had my name, I\u2019d be under your power, wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u201cWould you?\u201d Jax asked.\n\u201cOf course.\u201d The old man frowned. \u201cThat is the way of things. Though you don\u2019t seem to be much for listening, it\u2019s best to be careful. If you managed to catch hold of even just a piece of my name, you\u2019d have all manner of power over me.\u201d\nJax wondered if this man might be able to help him. While he didn\u2019t seem to be terribly ordinary, Jax knew he was on no ordinary errand. If he\u2019d been trying to catch a cow, he would ask a farmer\u2019s help. But to catch the moon, perhaps he needed the help of an odd old man. \u201cYou said you used to chase the wind,\u201d Jax said. \u201cDid you ever catch it?\u201d\n\u201cIn some ways yes,\u201d the old man said. \u201cAnd in other ways, no. There are many ways of looking at that question, you see.\u201d\n\u201cCould you help me catch the moon?\u201d\n\u201cI might be able to give you some advice,\u201d the old man said reluctantly. \u201cBut first you should think this over, boy. When you love something, you have to make sure it loves you back, or you\u2019ll bring about no end of trouble chasing it.\u201d\nHespe didn\u2019t look at Dedan as she said this. She looked everywhere in the world but at him. Because of this, she didn\u2019t see the stricken, helpless look on his face.\n\u201cHow can I find out if she loves me?\u201d Jax asked.\n\u201cYou could try listening,\u201d the old man said, almost shyly. \u201cIt works wonders, you know. I could teach you how.\u201d\n\u201cHow long would that take?\u201d\n\u201cA couple years,\u201d the old man said. \u201cGive or take. It depends on if you have a knack for it. It\u2019s tricky, proper listening. But once you have it, you\u2019ll know the moon down to the bottoms of her feet.\u201d\nJax shook his head. \u201cToo long. If I can catch her, I can talk with her. I can make\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s part of your problem right there,\u201d the old man said. \u201cYou don\u2019t really want to catch her. Not really. Will you trail her through the sky? Of course not. You want to meet her. That means you need the moon to come to you.\u201d", "\u201cHow can I do that?\u201d he said.\nThe old man smiled. \u201cWell that\u2019s the question, isn\u2019t it? What do you have that the moon might want? What do you have to offer the moon?\u201d\n\u201cOnly what I have in these packs.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not quite what I meant,\u201d the old man muttered. \u201cBut we might as well take a look at what you\u2019ve brought, too.\u201d\nThe old hermit looked through the first pack and found many practical things. The contents of the second pack were more expensive and rare, but no more useful.\nThen the old man saw the third pack. \u201cAnd what do you have in there?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been able to get it open,\u201d Jax said. \u201cThe knot is too much for me.\u201d\nThe hermit closed his eyes for a moment, listening. Then he opened his eyes and frowned at Jax. \u201cThe knot says you tore at it. Pricked it with a knife. Bit it with your teeth.\u201d\nJax was surprised. \u201cI did,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI told you, I tried everything to get it open.\u201d\n\u201cHardly everything,\u201d the hermit said scornfully. He lifted the pack until the knotted cord was in front of his face. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cBut would you open up?\u201d He paused. \u201cYes. I apologize. He won\u2019t do it again.\u201d\nThe knot unraveled and the hermit opened the pack. Looking inside, his eyes widened and he let out a low whistle.\nBut when the old man spread the pack open on the ground, Jax\u2019s shoulders slumped. He had been hoping for money, or gems, some treasure he could give the moon as a gift. But all the pack held was a bent piece of wood, a stone flute, and a small iron box.\nOf these, only the flute caught Jax\u2019s attention. It was made of a pale green stone. \u201cI had a flute when I was younger,\u201d Jax said. \u201cBut it broke and I could never make it right again.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re all quite impressive,\u201d the hermit said.\n\u201cThe flute is nice enough,\u201d Jax said with a shrug. \u201cBut what use is a piece of wood and a box too small for anything practical?\u201d\nThe hermit shook his head. \u201cCan\u2019t you hear them? Most things whisper. These things shout.\u201d He pointed at the piece of crooked wood. \u201cThat is a folding house unless I miss my guess. Quite a nice one too.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a folding house?\u201d\n\u201cYou know how you can fold a piece of paper on itself, and each time it", "gets smaller?\u201d the old man gestured at the piece of crooked wood. \u201cA folding house is like that. Except it\u2019s a house, of course.\u201d\nJax took hold of the piece of crooked wood and tried to straighten it. Suddenly he was holding two pieces of wood that resembled the beginning of a doorframe.\n\u201cDon\u2019t unfold it here!\u201d the old man shouted. \u201cI don\u2019t want a house outside my cave, blocking my sunlight!\u201d\nJax tried to push the two pieces of wood, back together. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I fold it back up?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you don\u2019t know how, I expect,\u201d the old man said plainly. \u201cI suggest you wait until you know where you want it before you unfold it the rest of the way.\u201d\nJax set the wood down carefully, then picked up the flute. \u201cIs this special too?\u201d He put it to his lips and blew a simple trill like a Will\u2019s Widow.\nHespe smiled teasingly, lifted a familiar wooden whistle to her lips, and blew: Ta-ta DEE. Ta-ta DEE.\nNow everyone knows the Will\u2019s Widow is also called a nightjar. So it isn\u2019t out when the sun is shining. Despite this, a dozen nightjars flew down and landed all around Jax, looking at him curiously and blinking in the bright sunlight.\n\u201cIt seems to be more than the usual flute,\u201d the old man said.\n\u201cAnd the box?\u201d Jax reached out and picked it up. It was dark, and cold, and small enough that he could close his hand around it.\nThe old man shivered and looked away from the box. \u201cIt\u2019s empty.\u201d \u201cHow can you tell without seeing inside?\u201d\n\u201cBy listening,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m amazed you can\u2019t hear it yourself. It\u2019s the\nemptiest thing I\u2019ve ever heard. It echoes. It\u2019s meant for keeping things inside.\u201d\n\u201cAll boxes are meant for keeping things inside.\u201d\n\u201cAnd all flutes are meant to play beguiling music,\u201d the old man pointed out. \u201cBut this flute is moreso. The same is true with this box.\u201d\nJax looked at the box for a moment, then set it down carefully and began to tie up the third pack with the three treasures inside it. \u201cI think I\u2019ll be moving on,\u201d Jax said.\n\u201cAre you sure you won\u2019t consider staying for a month or two?\u201d the old man said. \u201cYou could learn to listen just a bit more closely. Useful thing, listening.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019ve given me some things to think about,\u201d Jax said. \u201cAnd I think you\u2019re right, I shouldn\u2019t be chasing the moon. I should make the moon come to me.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I actually said,\u201d the old man murmured. But he did so in a resigned way. Skilled listener that he was, he knew he wasn\u2019t being heard.\nJax set off the next morning, following the moon higher into the mountains. Eventually he found a large, flat piece of ground nestled high among the tallest peaks.\nJax brought out the crooked piece of wood and, piece by piece, began to unfold the house. With the whole night in front of him, he was hoping to have it finished well before the moon began to rise.\nBut the house was much larger than he had guessed, more a mansion than a simple cottage. What\u2019s more, unfolding it was more complicated than he had expected. By the time the moon reached the top of the sky, he was still far from being finished.\nPerhaps Jax hurried because of this. Perhaps he was reckless. Or perhaps it was just that Jax was unlucky as ever.\nIn the end the result was the same: the mansion was magnificent, huge and sprawling. But it didn\u2019t fit together properly. There were stairways that led sideways instead of up. Some rooms had too few walls, or too many. Many rooms had no ceiling, and high above they showed a strange sky full of unfamiliar stars.\nEverything about the place was slightly skewed. In one room you could look out the window at the springtime flowers, while across the hall the windows were filmed with winter\u2019s frost. It could be time for breakfast in the ballroom, while twilight filled a nearby bedroom.\nBecause nothing in the house was true, none of the doors or windows fit tight. They could be closed, even locked, but never made fast. And as big as it was, the mansion had a great many doors and windows, so there were a great many ways both in and out.\nJax paid no mind to any of this. Instead, he raced to the top of the highest tower and put the flute to his lips.\nHe poured out a sweet song into the clear night sky. No simple bird trill, this was a song that came from his broken heart. It was strong and sad. It fluttered like a bird with a broken wing.\nHearing it, the moon came down to the tower. Pale and round and beautiful, she stood before Jax in all her glory, and for the first time in his life", "he felt a single breath of joy.\nThey spoke then, on the top of the tower. Jax telling her of his life, his\nwager, and his long, lonely journey. The moon listened, and laughed, and smiled.\nBut eventually she looked longingly toward the sky.\nJax knew what this foretold. \u201cStay with me,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cI can only be happy if you\u2019re mine.\u201d\n\u201cI must go,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sky is my home.\u201d\n\u201cI have made a home for you,\u201d Jax said, gesturing to the vast mansion below them. \u201cThere is sky enough for you here. An empty sky that is all for you.\u201d\n\u201cI must go,\u201d she said. \u201cI have been away too long.\u201d\nHe raised his hand as if to grab her, then stopped himself. \u201cTime is what we make it here,\u201d he said. \u201cYour bedroom can be winter or spring, all according to your desire.\u201d\n\u201cI must go,\u201d she said, looking upward. \u201cBut I will return. I am always and unchanging. And if you play your flute for me, I will visit you again.\u201d\n\u201cI have given you three things,\u201d he said. \u201cA song, a home, and my heart. If you must go, will you not give me three things in return?\u201d\nShe laughed, holding her hands out to her sides. She was naked as the moon. \u201cWhat do I have that I can leave with you? But if it is mine to give, ask and I will give it.\u201d\nJax found his mouth was dry. \u201cFirst I would ask for a touch of your hand.\u201d\n\u201cOne hand clasps another, and I grant you your request.\u201d She reached out to him, her hand smooth and strong. At first it seemed cool, then marvelously warm. Gooseflesh ran all up and down Jax\u2019s arms.\n\u201cSecond, I would beg a kiss,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOne mouth tastes another, and I grant you your request.\u201d She leaned in close to him. Her breath was sweet, her lips firm as fruit. The kiss pulled the breath out of Jax, and for the first time in his life, his mouth curved into the beginning of a smile.\n\u201cAnd what is the third thing?\u201d the moon asked. Her eyes were dark and wise, her smile was full and knowing.\n\u201cYour name,\u201d Jax breathed. \u201cThat I might call you by it.\u201d\n\u201cOne body . . .\u201d the moon began, stepping forward eagerly. Then she paused. \u201cOnly my name?\u201d she asked, sliding her hand around his waist.\nJax nodded.", "She leaned close and spoke warmly against his ear, \u201cLudis.\u201d\nAnd Jax brought out the black iron box, closing the lid and catching her name inside.\n\u201cNow I have your name,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cSo I have mastery over you. And I say you must stay with me forever, so I can be happy.\u201d\nAnd so it was. The box was no longer cold in his hand. It was warm, and inside he could feel her name, fluttering like a moth against a windowpane.\nPerhaps Jax had been too slow in closing the box. Perhaps he fumbled with the clasp. Or perhaps he was simply unlucky in all things. But in the end he only managed to catch a piece of the moon\u2019s name, not the thing entire.\nSo Jax could keep her for a while, but she always slips away from him. Out from his broken mansion, back to our world. But still, he has a piece of her name, and so she always must return.\nHespe looked around at us, smiling. \u201cAnd that is why the moon is always changing. And that is where Jax keeps her when she is not in our sky. He caught her and he keeps her still. But whether or not he is happy is only for him to know.\u201d\nThere was a long moment of silence.\n\u201cThat,\u201d Dedan said, \u201cis one hell of a story.\u201d\nHespe looked down, and though the firelight made it difficult to tell, I\nwould have bet a penny she was blushing. Hard Hespe, who I wouldn\u2019t have guessed had a drop of blushing in her. \u201cIt took me a long time to remember all of it,\u201d she said, \u201cMy mother used to tell it to me when I was a little girl. Every night, always the same. Said she learned it from her mother.\u201d\n\u201cWell you\u2019ll need to make sure you tell your daughters, too,\u201d Dedan said. \u201cA story like that is too good to let fall by the roadside.\u201d\nHespe smiled.\nUnfortunately, that peaceful evening was like the lull that comes in the center of a storm. The next day Hespe made a comment that sent Dedan off in a\n  \nhuff, and for two hours they could barely look at each other without hissing like angry cats.\nDedan tried to convince everyone we should give up our search and instead sign up as caravan guards, hoping the bandits would attack us. Marten said that made as much sense as trying to find a bear trap by putting your foot in it. Marten was right, but that didn\u2019t keep Dedan and the tracker from snapping at each other over the next couple days.\nTwo days later, Hespe gave a surprisingly girlish shriek of alarm while bathing. We ran to her assistance, expecting bandits, and instead found Tempi naked, knee-deep in the stream. Hespe stood half-dressed and dripping wet on the shore. Marten thought it was hilarious. Hespe did not. And the only thing that kept Dedan from flying into a rage and attacking Tempi was the fact that he couldn\u2019t figure out how to attack a naked man without looking in his direction or actually touching him.\nThe day after that, the weather grew foggy and damp, souring everyone\u2019s mood and slowing our search even further.\nThen it began to rain.", "CHAPTER EIGHTY-NINE\nLosing the Light\nTHE LAST FOUR DAYS had been endlessly overcast and raining. At first the trees had given us some shelter, but we soon discovered that the leaves overhead merely held the rain, and the slightest stir of wind sent down showers of heavy drops that had been gathering for hours. This meant that whether or not it was currently raining, we were constantly dripped upon and damp.\nStories after supper had stopped. Marten caught a cold, and as it worsened he grew sullen and sarcastic. And two days ago the bread had gotten wet. This might sound like a small thing, but if you\u2019ve ever tried to eat a piece of wet bread after a day of walking in the rain, you know what sort of mood it puts you in.\nDedan had grown truly unmanageable. He balked and complained at the simplest of tasks. The last time he had gone into town for supplies, he had bought a bottle of dreg instead of potatoes, butter, and bowstrings. Hespe left him behind at Crosson and he didn\u2019t get back to camp until nearly midnight, stinking drunk and singing loud enough to make the dead cover their ears.\nI didn\u2019t bother telling him off. Sharp as my trouper\u2019s tongue was, he was obviously immune to it. Instead I waited until he passed out, poured the remaining dreg on the fire, and left the bottle sitting in the coals for him to see. After that, he stopped his constant derogatory muttering about me and settled into chilly silence. While the quiet was nice, I knew it was a bad sign.\nGiven everyone\u2019s rising temper, I\u2019d decided each of us would search for trail sign on our own. This was partly because walking in someone\u2019s footsteps over wet turf was a sure way to tear up the ground and leave a trail. But the other reason is that I knew if I sent Dedan and Hespe out together, their eventual argument would alert any bandit within ten miles.\n \nI came back to camp dripping wet and miserable. It turns out the boots I\u2019d bought in Severen didn\u2019t have a lick of waterproofing, so they drank rainwater like sponges. In the evening I could dry them out using the heat of the fire and a little careful sympathy. But as soon as I took three steps they were soaked through again. So on top of everything my feet had been cold and damp for days.\nIt was our twenty-ninth day in the Eld, and when I came over the tiny ridge that hid our latest camp, I saw Dedan and Hespe sitting on opposite sides of the fire, ignoring each other. Hespe was oiling her sword. Dedan was idly jabbing the ground in front of him with a pointed stick.\nI wasn\u2019t in much mood for conversation myself. Hoping the silence held, I went wordlessly to the fire.\nExcept there was no fire.\n\u201cWhat happened to the fire?\u201d I asked stupidly. What had happened was rather obvious. It had been left to burn down to charred sticks and damp ashes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my turn to get wood,\u201d Hespe said pointedly.\nDedan poked at the dirt with his stick. I noticed the beginnings of a bruise high on his cheek.\nAll I wanted in the world was a little something hot to eat and ten minutes with dry feet. It wouldn\u2019t make me happy, but it would bring me closer to happy than I\u2019d been all day. \u201cI\u2019m surprised the two of you can piss without help,\u201d I spat.\nDedan glared up at me. \u201cJust what do you mean by that?\u201d\n\u201cWhen Alveron asked me to do this job for him, he implied I would have adults helping me, not a handful of schoolchildren.\u201d\nDedan\u2019s snapped. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what she\u2014\u201d\nI cut him off. \u201cI don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care what you\u2019re bickering about. I don\u2019t care what she threw at you. I care that the fire is out. Tehlu above, a trained dog would be more help!\u201d\nDedan\u2019s expression firmed into a familiar belligerence. \u201cMaybe if\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d I said. \u201cI would rather listen to a jackass braying than waste my time with whatever you\u2019re saying. When I come back to camp I expect fire and a meal. If this is beyond you, I\u2019ll arrange to have some five-year-old come out from Crosson and babysit the both of you.\u201d\nDedan stood. The wind gusted in the trees above us, sending down heavy", "drops to patter on the ground. \u201cYou\u2019re on your way to a meal you won\u2019t be able to stomach, boy.\u201d\nHis hands clenched into fists, and I reached into my pocket to grip the mommet I had made of him two days ago. I felt my stomach clench in fear and fury. \u201cDedan, if you take a single step toward me, I will lay such pain on you that you will scream for me to kill you.\u201d I stared him square in the eye. \u201cRight now I am irritated. Do not even think of making me angry.\u201d\nHe paused, and I could almost hear him thinking of every story he had ever heard about Taborlin the Great. Fire and lightning. There was a moment of long silence as the two of us stared at each other, unblinking.\nLuckily, at this point Tempi returned to camp, breaking the tension. Feeling a little foolish, I went to the embers of the fire to see if I could rekindle it. Dedan stomped into the trees, hopefully in search of wood. At this point I didn\u2019t care if it was rennel or not.\nTempi sat by the side of the dead fire. Perhaps if I hadn\u2019t been busy I might have noticed something odd in his movement. Then again, perhaps not. Even for a semieducated barbarian such as myself, the moods of the Adem are difficult to read.\nAs I coaxed the fire slowly back to life, I began to regret how I had handled things. That thought alone kept me from lashing out at Dedan when he returned with an armload of wet wood and dropped it at the edge of my newly rebuilt fire, scattering it.\nMarten came back shortly after I had rebuilt the fire a second time. He settled at the edge of it and spread his hands. His eyes were sunken and dark.\n\u201cFeeling any better?\u201d I asked him.\n\u201cLoads.\u201d His voice rasped wetly in his chest, sounding worse than it had this morning. I worried about the sound of his breathing, about pneumonia, about fever.\n\u201cI can mix you a tea that will make your throat a little easier,\u201d I suggested without much hope. He\u2019d rejected all my offers of help over the last several days.\nHe hesitated, then nodded. As I was heating the water he had a fit of violent coughing that lasted nearly a minute. If the rain didn\u2019t stop tonight we would have to head into town and wait for him to recover. I couldn\u2019t risk him catching pneumonia or giving away our position to bandit sentries with a coughing fit.\nI handed him his tea, and Tempi stirred in his seat by the edge of the fire.", "\u201cI killed two men today,\u201d he said.\nThere was a long moment of stunned silence. Rain pattered on the ground\naround us. The fire hissed and spat.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked incredulously.\n\u201cI was attack by two men behind trees,\u201d Tempi said calmly.\nI rubbed the back of my neck. \u201cDammit Tempi, why didn\u2019t you say\nsomething before?\u201d\nHe gave me a level look and his fingers made an unfamiliar circle. \u201cIt is\nnot easy to kill two men,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d Hespe asked.\nTempi turned his cool look on her next. Offended. I\u2019d misunderstood his\nprevious comment. It wasn\u2019t the fight itself he had found difficult. It was the fact that he had killed two men. \u201cI have needed this time to settle my thought. Also, I wait to when all are here.\u201d\nI tried to remember the gesture for apology, but had to settle for sorrow instead. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked calmly as I fingered the frayed ends of my patience.\nTempi paused to choose his words. \u201cI was trying to find trail when two men jump out from trees.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did they look like?\u201d Dedan asked, beating me to the question.\nAnother pause. \u201cOne your size, his arms longer than mine, stronger than me but slow. Slower than you.\u201d Dedan\u2019s expression darkened, as if he couldn\u2019t decide if he had been insulted. \u201cThe other was smaller and quicker. Both their swords were broad and thick. Edged on both sides. This long.\u201d He held his hands perhaps three feet apart.\nI thought the description revealed more about Tempi than the men he fought. \u201cWhere did it happen? How long ago?\u201d\nHe pointed in the direction we had been searching. \u201cLess than one mile. Less than one hour.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think they were waiting for you?\u201d\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t there when I came through,\u201d Marten said defensively. He gave a wet, tearing cough deep in his chest and spat something thick onto the ground. \u201cIf they were waiting, they couldn\u2019t have been waiting long.\u201d\nTempi gave an eloquent shrug.\n\u201cWhat sort of armor did they have?\u201d Dedan asked.\nTempi was quiet for a moment, then reached out to tap my boot. \u201cThis?\u201d \u201cLeather?\u201d I suggested.", "He nodded. \u201cLeather. Hard, and with some metal.\u201d\nDedan relaxed a bit. \u201cThat\u2019s something at least.\u201d He mused, then looked up sharply at Hespe, \u201cWhat? What was that look you just gave me?\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t looking at you,\u201d Hespe said frostily.\n\u201cYou were so. You rolled your eyes.\u201d He looked at Marten. \u201cYou saw her roll her eyes, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cShut. Up.\u201d I snarled at the two of them. Surprisingly, things grew quiet. I pressed the heels of my hands to my eyes and gave our situation a moment of uninterrupted thought. \u201cMarten, how much light do we have left?\u201d\nHe looked up at the slate-colored sky. \u201cAbout another hour and a half like this,\u201d he rasped. \u201cEnough to track in. Then maybe a quarter hour of bad light after that. The sun will go down quick behind these clouds.\u201d\n\u201cDo you feel up to a little more running around today?\u201d I asked.\nHis grin surprised me. \u201cIf we can find these bastards tonight, let\u2019s do it. They\u2019ve kept me tramping around this God-forsaken place long enough.\u201d\nI nodded, reached out, and took a pinch of damp ash from the pitifully small fire. I rubbed it between my fingers thoughtfully, then wiped it onto a small rag and tucked it into my cloak. It wouldn\u2019t be a good source of heat, but anything was better than nothing.\n\u201cAlright,\u201d I said. \u201cTempi will lead us to the bodies, then we\u2019ll see if we can trail them back to their camp.\u201d I stood up.\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d Dedan said, holding out his hands. \u201cWhat about us?\u201d\n\u201cYou and Hespe stay here and guard the camp.\u201d I bit my tongue to keep from adding, and try to keep the fire from going out.\n\u201cWhy? Let\u2019s all go. We can take care of them tonight!\u201d He got to his feet. \u201cAnd what if there\u2019s a dozen of them?\u201d I asked in my best scathing tones. He paused, but didn\u2019t back down. \u201cWe\u2019ll have the element of surprise.\u201d \u201cWe won\u2019t have the element of surprise if all five of us go tramping\naround,\u201d I said hotly.\n\u201cWhy are you going then?\u201d Dedan demanded. \u201cIt could just be Tempi and\nMarten.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going because I need to see what we\u2019re up against. I\u2019m the one that is\ngoing to be making the plan that will get us through this alive.\u201d\n\u201cWhy should greenwood like you be making the plan at all?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re losing the light,\u201d Marten interjected wearily.\n\u201cBlessed Tehlu, a voice of reason speaks.\u201d I looked at Dedan. \u201cWe are\ngoing. You are staying. That is an order.\u201d", "\u201cAn order?\u201d Dedan echoed with dark incredulity.\nWe eyed each other dangerously for a moment, then I turned and followed Tempi into the trees. Thunder growled through the sky above us. A wind moved through the trees, clearing away the endless drizzle. In its place a steady rain began to fall.", "CHAPTER NINETY\nTo Sing a Song About\nTEMPI LIFTED THE PINE boughs that covered the two men. Laid carefully on their backs, they looked as if they were sleeping. I knelt at the side of the larger one, but before I could get a better look, I felt a hand on my shoulder. Looking back I saw Tempi shaking his head.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked. We had less than an hour of light left. Hunting down the bandits\u2019 camp without getting caught was going to be difficult enough. Doing it in a pitch-black storm would be a nightmare.\n\u201cYou should not,\u201d he said. Firm. Serious. \u201cTroubling the dead is not of the Lethani.\u201d\n\u201cI need to know about our enemies. I can learn things from them that will help us.\u201d\nHis mouth almost frowned, disapproval. \u201cMagic?\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cLooking only.\u201d I pointed to my eyes then tapped my temple. \u201cThinking.\u201d\nTempi nodded. But as I turned back to the bodies, I felt his hand on my shoulder again. \u201cYou must ask. They are my dead.\u201d\n\u201cYou already agreed,\u201d I pointed out.\n\u201cAsking is the right thing,\u201d he said.\nI took a deep breath. \u201cMay I look at your dead, Tempi?\u201d\nHe nodded once, formally.\nI looked over to where Marten was giving his bowstring a careful\ninspection under a nearby tree. \u201cDo you want to see if you can find their trail?\u201d He nodded and pushed himself away from the tree. \u201cI\u2019d start over there.\u201d I pointed to the south between two ridges.\n\u201cI know my business,\u201d he said as he walked off, shouldering his bow.\nTempi took a couple steps away, and I turned my attention to the bodies. One was actually quite a bit larger than Dedan, a great bull of a man. They were older than I had expected, and their hands had the calluses that mark long years of working with weapons. These were not disgruntled farm boys.", "These were veterans.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got their trail,\u201d Marten said, startling me. I hadn\u2019t heard the sound of\nhim approaching over the low susurrus of the falling rain. \u201cIt\u2019s clear as day. A drunk priest could follow it.\u201d There was a flicker of lightning across the sky and an accompanying grumble of thunder. The rain started to come down harder. I frowned and pulled the tinker\u2019s sodden cloak tighter around my shoulders.\nMarten tilted his head up and let the rain fall full on his face. \u201cI\u2019m glad this weather is finally doing us some good,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more it rains the easier it will be for us to sneak in and away from their camp.\u201d He wiped his hands on his dripping shirt and shrugged. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s not like we can get any wetter than we already are.\u201d\n\u201cYou have a point,\u201d I said, standing.\nTempi covered the bodies with the branches, and Marten led us away to the south.\nMarten knelt to examine something on the ground, and I took the opportunity to catch up with him.\n\u201cWe\u2019re being followed,\u201d I said, not bothering to whisper it. They were at least seventy feet behind us, and the rain was rolling through the trees with a noise like waves against the shore.\nHe nodded and pretended to point at something on the ground. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d seen them.\u201d\nI smiled and stripped water from my face with a wet hand. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one here with eyes. How many do you think there are?\u201d\n\u201cTwo, maybe three.\u201d\nTempi drew close to us. \u201cTwo,\u201d he said with certainty in his voice.\n\u201cI only saw one,\u201d I admitted. \u201cHow close are we to their camp?\u201d\n\u201cNo guess. Could be over the next hill. Could be miles off. There are still\njust these two sets of tracks, and I can\u2019t smell any fires.\u201d He stood up and started to follow the trail again without looking back.\nI pushed a low branch aside as Tempi walked past and caught a glimpse of movement behind us that had nothing to do with wind or rain. \u201cLet\u2019s go over this next ridge and set a little trap.\u201d\n \n\u201cSounds like the very thing,\u201d Marten agreed.\nGesturing for us to wait, Marten crouched low and edged his way up to the top of the small rise. I fought the urge to look behind us while he peered over the lip of the ridge, then scampered over.\nThere was a bright flash as lightning struck nearby. The thunder was like a fist in my chest. I startled. Tempi stood.\n\u201cThis is like of home,\u201d he said smiling faintly. He made no attempt to keep the water from his face.\nMarten waved, and we stalked over the top of the ridge. Once we were out of sight of whoever was following us, I looked around quickly. \u201cKeep following the tracks up to that twisted spruce, then circle back.\u201d I gestured. \u201cTempi hides there. Marten behind that fallen tree. I\u2019ll go behind that stone. Marten will make the first move. Use your judgment, but it would probably be best if you waited until they were past that broken stump. Try to leave one of them alive if possible, but we can\u2019t have them getting away or making too much noise.\u201d\n\u201cWhat will you be doing?\u201d Marten asked as we hurried to lay down a clear set of tracks as far as the twisted spruce tree.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be staying out of the way. The two of you are better equipped for this sort of thing. But I have a trick or two if it comes to that.\u201d We reached the tree. \u201cReady?\u201d\nMarten seemed a little startled by my sudden barrage of orders, but they both nodded and went quickly to their places.\nI circled around and settled behind a lumpish upcrop of stone. From my vantage I could see our muddy footprints mingling with the trail we followed. Past that I saw Tempi position himself behind the trunk of a thick burl oak. To his right, Marten nocked an arrow, drew the string back to his shoulder, and waited, motionless as a statue.\nI brought out the rag that held the pinch of ash and a slender piece of iron, holding them ready in my hand. My stomach churned as I thought about what we had been sent here to do: hunt and kill men. True, they were outlaws and murderers, but men nonetheless. I deepened my breathing and tried to relax.\nThe surface of the stone was chill and gritty against my cheek. I strained my ears but couldn\u2019t hear anything over the steady drumming of the rain. I fought the urge to lean farther around the edge of the stone and broaden my field of vision. Lightning flashed again, and I was counting the seconds until the thunder when I saw a pair of figures slink into view.", "I felt a sullen heat flare up in my chest. \u201cShoot them, Marten,\u201d I said loudly.\nDedan whirled around and was facing me with his sword drawn by the time I stepped from my hiding place. Hespe was a little more restrained and stopped with her sword halfway out of its scabbard.\nI put my knife away and walked to within a half-dozen steps of Dedan. The thunder rolled over us as I caught and held his eyes. His expression was defiant, and I did not bother to disguise my anger. After a long minute of silence he looked away, pretending he needed to brush the water from his eyes.\n\u201cPut that away.\u201d I nodded to his sword. After a second\u2019s hesitation he did so. Only then did I slide the thin piece of brittle steel I held back into the lining of my cloak. \u201cIf we were bandits you would already be dead.\u201d I moved my gaze from Dedan to Hespe and back again. \u201cGo back to camp.\u201d\nDedan\u2019s expression twisted. \u201cI\u2019m sick of you talking to me like I\u2019m a kid.\u201d He jabbed a finger toward me. \u201cI\u2019ve been in this world a lot longer than you. I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d\nI bit down several angry responses that couldn\u2019t help but make matters worse. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to argue with you. We\u2019re losing the light, and you\u2019re putting us in danger. Go back to camp.\u201d\n\u201cWe should take care of this tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve already knackered off two of them, there\u2019s probably only five or six left. We\u2019ll surprise them in the dark, in the middle of the storm. Wham. Bam. We\u2019ll be back in Crosson tomorrow for lunch.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what if there\u2019s a dozen of them? What if there\u2019s twenty? What if they\u2019re holed up in a farmhouse? What if they find our camp while no one\u2019s there? All our supplies, our food, and my lute could be gone, and a trap waiting for us when we come back. All because you couldn\u2019t sit still for an hour.\u201d His face reddened dangerously, and I turned away. \u201cGo back to camp. We\u2019ll talk about this tonight.\u201d\n\u201cNo, dammit. I\u2019m coming, and there\u2019s not a damn thing you can do to stop me.\u201d\nI ground my teeth. The worst part was that it was true. I had no way of enforcing my authority. There was nothing I could do short of subduing him with the wax simulacra I\u2019d made. And I knew that to be the worst possible option. Not only would it turn Dedan into an outright enemy, it would undoubtedly turn Hespe and Marten against me too.", "I looked to Hespe. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\nShe darted a quick look at Dedan. \u201cHe was going to go alone. I thought it was better if we stayed together. And we did think it through. Nobody\u2019s going to stumble onto the camp. We hid our gear and doused the fire before we left.\u201d\nI gave a tight sigh and tucked the useless pinch of ash into a pocket of my cloak. Of course they did.\n\u201cBut I agree,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should try to finish it tonight.\u201d\nI looked to Marten.\nHe gave me an apologetic look. \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t want this\nover,\u201d he said, then added quickly, \u201cIf we can do it smart.\u201d He might have said more, but the words caught in his throat and he began to cough.\nI looked at Tempi. Tempi looked back.\nThe worst thing was, my gut agreed with Dedan. I wanted this done. I wanted a warm bed and a decent meal. I wanted to get Marten somewhere dry. I wanted to go back to Severen where I could bask in Alveron\u2019s gratitude. I wanted to find Denna, apologize, and explain why I had left without a word.\nOnly a fool fights the tide. \u201cFine.\u201d I looked up at Dedan. \u201cIf one of your friends dies because of this, it will be your fault.\u201d I saw a flicker of uncertainty cross his face, then disappear as he set his jaw. He had said too much for his pride to let him back down.\nI leveled a long finger at him. \u201cBut from now on each of you must do as I say. I\u2019ll listen to your suggestions, but I give the orders.\u201d I looked around. Marten and Tempi nodded right away, with Hespe following only a second after. Dedan gave a slow nod.\nI looked at him. \u201cSwear it.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cIf you pull another stunt like this when we\u2019re attacking tonight, you could get us killed. I don\u2019t trust you. I\u2019d rather leave tonight than go into this with someone I can\u2019t trust.\u201d\nThere was another tense moment, but before it stretched too long Marten chimed in, \u201cC\u2019mon Den. The boy\u2019s actually got a fair bit on the ball. He set up this little ambush in about four seconds.\u201d His tone turned jocular. \u201cBesides, he\u2019s not as bad as that bastard Brenwe, and the money for that little privy-dance wasn\u2019t half as good.\u201d\nDedan cracked a smile. \u201cYeah, I suppose you\u2019re right. So long as it\u2019s over tonight.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t doubt for a second Dedan would still go his own way if it suited", "him. \u201cSwear you\u2019ll follow my orders.\u201d\nHe shrugged and looked away. \u201cYeah. I swear.\u201d\nNot enough. \u201cSwear it on your name.\u201d\nHe wiped the rain from his face and looked back at me, confused. \u201cWhat?\u201d I faced him and spoke formally. \u201cDedan. Will you do as I say tonight,\nwithout questioning or hesitation? Dedan. Do you swear it on your name?\u201d He shifted from foot to foot for a moment, then straightened a little. \u201cI\nswear it on my name.\u201d\nI stepped closer to him and said \u201cDedan\u201d very softly. At the same time I\nfed a small, tiny burst of heat through the wax simulacra in my pocket. Not enough to do anything, but enough that he could feel it, just for a moment.\nI saw his eyes widen, and I gave him my best Taborlin the Great smile. The smile was full of secrets, wide and confident, and more than slightly smug. It was a smile that told an entire story all by itself.\n\u201cI have your name now,\u201d I said softly. \u201cI have mastery over you.\u201d\nThe look on his face was almost worth a month of his grumbling. I stepped back and let the smile disappear, quick as a flicker of lightning. Easy as taking off a mask. Which, of course, would leave him wondering which expression was the real one, the young boy or the half-glimpsed Taborlin?\nI turned away before I lost the moment. \u201cMarten will scout ahead. Tempi and I will follow five minutes behind. That will give him time to spot their lookouts and come back to warn us. You two follow ten minutes behind us.\u201d\nI gave Dedan a pointed look and held up both hands with my fingers splayed. \u201cTen full minutes. It\u2019ll be slower this way. But it\u2019s safest. Any suggestions?\u201d Nobody said anything. \u201cAll right. Marten, it\u2019s your show. Come back if you run into trouble.\u201d\n\u201cCount on it,\u201d he said, and soon passed from our sight, lost in the blurry green and brown of leaf and bark and rock and rain.\nThe rain continued to pelt down, and the light was beginning to fail as Tempi and I followed the trail, slinking from one hiding place to another. Noise, at least, was not a concern as the thunder made a near constant grumbling overhead.\nMarten appeared with no warning from the underbrush and motioned us to\n \nthe marginal shelter of a leaning maple. \u201cTheir camp is right up ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s tracks all over the place, and I saw light from their fire.\u201d\n\u201cHow many of them?\u201d\nMarten shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t get that close. As soon as I saw different sets of footprints I came back. I didn\u2019t want you following the wrong tracks and getting lost.\u201d\n\u201cHow far?\u201d\n\u201cAbout a minute\u2019s creep. You could see their fire from here, but their camp\u2019s on the other side of a rise.\u201d\nI looked at the faces of my two companions in the dimming light. Neither of them seemed nervous. They were suited for this sort of work, trained for it. Marten had his abilities as a tracker and a bowman. Tempi had the legendary skill of the Adem.\nI might have felt calm too, if I had had the opportunity to prepare some plan, some trick of sympathy that could tip things in our favor. But Dedan had ruined all hopes of that by insisting we attack tonight. I had nothing, not even a bad link to a distant fire.\nI stopped that line of thinking before it could turn from anxiety to panic. \u201cLet\u2019s go then,\u201d I said, pleased at the calm timbre of my voice.\nThe three of us crept forward as the last of the light slowly bled from the sky. In the grey, Marten and Tempi were difficult to see, which reassured me. If it was hard for me, it would be near impossible for sentries to spot us from a distance.\nSoon I spied firelight reflecting off the undersides of high branches ahead. Crouching, I followed Marten and Tempi up the side of a steep bank, made slippery by the rain. I thought I saw a stir of movement ahead of us.\nThen lightning struck. In the near dark it was enough to blind me, but not before the muddy bank was highlighted in dazzling white.\nA tall man stood on the ridge with a drawn bow. Tempi crouched a few feet up the bank, frozen in the act of carefully placing his feet. Above him was Marten. The old tracker had gone to one knee and drawn his bow as well. The lightning showed me all of this in a great flash, then left me blind. The thunder came an instant after, deafening me as well. I dropped to the ground and rolled, wet leaves and dirt clinging to my face.\nWhen I opened my eyes all I could see were the blue ghosts the lightning had left dancing in front of my eyes. There was no outcry. If the sentry had made one it had been covered by the thunder. I lay very still until my eyes", "adjusted. It took me a long, breathless second to find Tempi. He was up the bank some fifteen feet, kneeling over a dark shape. The sentry.\nI approached him, scrabbling through the wet fern and muddy leaves. Lightning flickered again above us, more gently this time, and I saw the shaft of one of Marten\u2019s arrows protruding at an angle from the sentry\u2019s chest. The fletching had come loose and it fluttered in the wind like a tiny, sodden flag.\n\u201cDead,\u201d Tempi said when Marten and I were close enough to hear.\nI doubted it. Even a deep chest wound won\u2019t kill a man as quickly as that. But as I moved closer I saw the angle of the arrow. It was a heart shot. I looked at Marten with amazement. \u201cThat\u2019s a shot to sing a song about,\u201d I said quietly.\n\u201cLuck.\u201d He dismissed it and turned his attention to the top of the ridge a few feet above us. \u201cLet\u2019s hope I have some left,\u201d he said as he began to crawl.\nAs I crawled after him I caught a glimpse of Tempi still kneeling over the fallen man. He leaned close, as if whispering to the body.\nThen I saw the camp, and all vague curiosity about the Adem\u2019s peculiarity was pushed from my mind.", "CHAPTER NINETY-ONE\nFlame, Thunder, Broken Tree\nTHE RIDGE WE CROUCHED on made a wide half-circle, holding the bandits\u2019 camp in the center of a protective crescent. The result was that the camp sat at the bottom of a large, shallow bowl. From our position I could see the open portion of the bowl was bordered by a stream that curved in and away.\nThe trunk of a towering oak tree rose like a pillar in the center of the bowl, sheltering the camp with its huge branches. Two fires burned sullenly on either side of the great oak. Both would have been big as bonfires if not for the weather. As it was, they merely shed enough light to reveal the camp.\nCamp is a misleading term, \u201cencampment\u201d would be better. There were six field tents, short and sloping, mostly intended for sleeping and storing equipment. The seventh tent was almost a small pavilion, rectangular and large enough for several men to stand upright.\nSix men sat huddled close to the fires on makeshift benches. They were bundled up against the rain, all of them with the hard-eyed, long-suffering look of experienced soldiers.\nI ducked back below the ridgeline and was surprised to feel no fear at all. I turned to Marten, and saw his eyes were a little wild. \u201cHow many do you think there are?\u201d I asked.\nHis eyes flickered thoughtfully. \u201cAt least two to a tent. If their leader keeps to the big tent that makes thirteen, and we\u2019ve killed three. So ten. Ten at the very least.\u201d He licked his lips nervously. \u201cBut they could be sleeping as many as four to a tent, and the big tent could sleep five more in addition to the leader. That makes thirty, less three.\u201d\n\u201cSo at best we\u2019re outnumbered two to one,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you like those odds?\u201d\nHis eyes moved to the ridgeline, then back to me. \u201cI\u2019d take two to one. We\u2019ve got surprise, we\u2019re right up close.\u201d He paused and coughed into his sleeve. He spat. \u201cBut there\u2019s twenty of them down there. I can feel it in my", "balls.\u201d\n\u201cCan you convince Dedan?\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cHe\u2019ll believe me. He\u2019s not half the ass he seems most of the\ntime.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d I considered briefly. Things had been happening more quickly\nthan I can tell them aloud. So despite everything that had happened, Dedan and Hespe were still five or six minutes behind us. \u201cGo turn the two of them around,\u201d I told Marten. \u201cThen come back for Tempi and me.\u201d\nHe looked uncertain. \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to come now? We don\u2019t know when their guard might change.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll have Tempi with me. Besides, it should only take you a couple minutes. I want to see if I can get a better count of how many there are.\u201d\nMarten hurried off, and Tempi and I edged our way back up to the top of the ridge. After a moment he edged closer until the left side of his body was pressed up against my right.\nI noticed something I\u2019d missed earlier. There were wooden poles the size of tall fenceposts scattered throughout the camp.\n\u201cPosts?\u201d I asked Tempi, driving my finger into the ground to illustrate what I mean.\nHe nodded to show he understood, then shrugged.\nI guessed they might be tethers for horses, or drying poles for sodden clothes. I pushed it from my mind in favor of more pressing matters. \u201cWhat do you think we should do?\u201d\nTempi was silent for a long moment. \u201cKill some. Leave. Wait. Others come. We ...\u201d He gave the characteristic pause that meant he was lacking the word he wanted to use. \u201cJump behind trees?\u201d\n\u201cSurprise.\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cWe surprise. Wait. Hunt rest. Tell Maer.\u201d\nI nodded. Not the quick resolution we had hoped for, but the only sane\noption against this number of men. When Marten came back the three of us would take our first sting at them. I guessed with surprise on our side, Marten could mark as many as three or four with his bow before we were forced to flee. Odds were he wouldn\u2019t kill all of them, but any man arrowshot would be less of a threat to us in the days to come. \u201cAny other way?\u201d\nA long pause. \u201cNo way that is of the Lethani,\u201d he said.\nHaving seen enough, I carefully slid down several feet until I was out of sight. I shivered as the rain continued to pelt down. It felt colder than it had a", "couple minutes ago, and I began to worry that I\u2019d caught Marten\u2019s cold. That was the last thing I needed right now.\nI caught sight of Marten approaching and was about to explain our plan when I saw his panicked expression.\n\u201cI can\u2019t find them!\u201d he hissed frantically. \u201cI trailed back to where they should have been. But they weren\u2019t there. So either they already turned back, which they wouldn\u2019t do, or they were too close behind us and ended up following the wrong set of tracks in this bad light.\u201d\nI felt a chill that had nothing to do with the constant rain. \u201cCan\u2019t you track them down?\u201d\n\u201cIf I could, I would have. But all the prints look the same in the dark. What are we going to do?\u201d He clutched at my arm, I could tell by his eyes that he was on the verge of panic. \u201cThey won\u2019t be careful. They\u2019ll think we\u2019ve scouted everything ahead of them. What should we do?\u201d\nI reached into the pocket that held Dedan\u2019s simulacra. \u201cI can find them.\u201d\nBut before I could do anything, there was an outcry from the eastern edge of the camp. It was followed a second later by a furious shout and a string of cursing.\n\u201cIs that Dedan?\u201d I asked.\nMarten nodded. From over the ridge came the sound of frantic movement. The three of us moved as quickly as we dared, peering over the top.\nMen were swarming from the low tents like hornets from a nest. There were at least a dozen of them now, and I saw four with strung bows. Long sections of planking appeared from nowhere and were leaned against the posts, making crude walls about four feet high. Within seconds the vulnerable, wide-open camp became a veritable fortress. I counted at least sixteen men, but now whole sections of the camp were cut off from view. The light was worse as well, as the makeshift walls blocked the fires and cast deep shadows against the night.\nMarten was swearing a steady stream, understandably, as his bow wasn\u2019t nearly as useful now. He nocked an arrow quick as winking and might have fired it just as fast if I hadn\u2019t laid a hand on his arm. \u201cWait.\u201d\nHe frowned, then nodded, knowing they would have half a dozen arrows for every one of his. Tempi was suddenly useless as well. He would be riddled with arrows long before he came close to the camp.\nThe only bright facet was that their attention wasn\u2019t directed toward us. They were focused off to the east where we had heard the sentry\u2019s cry and", "Dedan\u2019s cursing. The three of us might escape before we were discovered, but that would mean leaving Dedan and Hespe behind.\nThis was the time when a skilled arcanist should be able to tip the scales, if not to give us an advantage, then at least to make escape possible. But I had no fire, no link. I was clever enough to make do without one of those, but without both I was nearly helpless.\nRain began to pour down more heavily. Thunder grumbled. It was only a matter of time before the bandits figured out there were only two of them and rushed over the ridge to make short work of our companions. If the three of us drew their attention we would be overrun just as quickly.\nThere was a concert of gentle hums, and a flight of arrows leapt over the eastern ridge. Marten stopped swearing and held his breath. He looked at me. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d he said urgently. There was a questioning shout from the camp, and when no answer was forthcoming another flight of arrows hummed over the eastern ridge, finding the range of their target.\n\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d Marten repeated. \u201cWhat if they\u2019re hurt?\u201d\nWhat if they\u2019re dead? I closed my eyes and slid down below the ridgeline, trying to gain a moment of clear thought. My foot bumped something soft and solid. The dead sentry. A dark thought occurred. I drew a deep breath and threw myself into the Heart of Stone. Deep. Deeper than I had ever been before. All fear left me, all hesitation.\nI took hold of the body by its wrist and began to drag it up toward the lip of the ridge. He was a heavy man, but I hardly noticed. \u201cMarten, may I use your dead?\u201d I asked absently. The words were in a pleasant baritone, the calmest voice I had ever heard.\nWithout waiting for an answer, I looked over the ridgeline toward the camp. I saw one of the men behind the wall bending his bow for another shot. I drew my long, slender knife of good Ramston steel and fixed the image of the bowman in my mind. I set my teeth and stabbed the dead sentry in the kidney. The knife went in slowly, as if I were stabbing heavy clay instead of flesh.\nA scream rose above the sound of the thunder. The man fell, his bow flying wildly out of his hands. Another mercenary stooped to look at his companion. I refocused and stabbed the sentry in his other kidney, using both hands this time. There was a second scream, shriller than the first. More a keen than a scream, I thought in an odd separate corner of my mind.\n\u201cDon\u2019t shoot yet,\u201d I cautioned Marten calmly, not looking away from the", "camp. \u201cThey still don\u2019t know where we are.\u201d I drew the knife out, refocused, and drove it coolly into the sentry\u2019s eye. A man stood upright behind the wooden wall, blood pouring down his face from underneath his clutching hands. Two of his comrades rose, trying to get him back below the wooden parapet. My knife rose and fell and one of them toppled to the ground even as his hands rose to his own bleeding face.\n\u201cHoly God,\u201d Marten choked. \u201cDear holy God.\u201d\nI set the knife against the sentry\u2019s throat and surveyed the camp. Their military efficiency was falling apart as they began to panic. One of the wounded men continued to scream, high and piercing over the grumbling thunder.\nI saw one of the bowmen searching the ridgeline with hard eyes. I drew the knife across the sentry\u2019s throat, but nothing seemed to happen. Then the bowman looked puzzled and raised his hand to touch his own throat. It came away lightly smeared with blood. His eyes grew wide and he began to shout. Dropping his bow he ran to the other side of the low wall, then back, trying to escape but not knowing where to run.\nThen he regained his composure and began desperately searching the ridgeline all around the camp. He showed no signs of falling. I frowned, set the knife against the dead sentry\u2019s neck again and leaned against it hard. My arms trembled, but the knife began to move again, slowly, as if I were trying to cut a block of ice. The bowman\u2019s hands flew to his neck and blood poured over them. He staggered, stumbled, and fell into one of the fires. He thrashed wildly, scattering burning coals everywhere, adding to the confusion.\nI was deciding where to strike next when lightning lit the sky, showing me a clear, stark picture of the body. The rain had mingled with the blood, and it was everywhere. My hands were dark with it.\nUnwilling to maim his hands, I rolled him over onto his stomach and struggled to remove his boots. Then I refocused myself and sawed through the thick tendons above the ankles and behind the knees. It crippled two more men. But the knife was moving more and more slowly, and my arms ached with the strain of it. The corpse was an excellent link, but the only energy I had was the strength of my body. Under these conditions, it felt more like I was cutting wood than flesh.\nIt had been scarcely more than a minute or two since the camp had been alerted. I spat water and took a moment\u2019s rest for my trembling arms and exhausted mind. I eyed the camp below, watching the confusion and panic", "build.\nA man emerged from the large tent at the base of the tree. He was dressed\ndifferently than the others, wearing a hauberk of bright chainmail that came nearly to his knees with a coif covering his head. He stepped into the chaos with a fearless grace, taking everything in at a glance. He snapped orders I couldn\u2019t hear over the sound of rain and thunder. His men calmed, settled back into their positions, and took up their bows and swords.\nAs I watched him stride across the encampment I was reminded of ... something. He stood in plain view, not bothering to crouch behind one of the protective walls. He gestured to his men, and something in that motion was terribly familiar....\n\u201cKvothe,\u201d Marten hissed. I looked up to see the tracker with his bow drawn tight to his ear. \u201cI\u2019ve got the shot on their boss.\u201d\n\u201cTake it.\u201d\nHis bow hummed and the man sprouted an arrow from his upper thigh, piercing the chain mail, the leg itself, and the armor behind it. From the corner of my eye I saw Marten draw another arrow and put it to the string in a fluid motion, but before he could shoot it, I saw their leader bend. Not a deep bending at the waist as if he were doubling over in pain. He bent at the neck to look down at the arrow that had pierced his leg.\nAfter a second\u2019s scrutiny he grasped the arrow in a fist and snapped off the fletching. Then he reached behind himself and pulled the arrow from his leg. I froze as he looked straight toward us and pointed to our position with the hand that held the broken arrow. He spoke a brief word of command to his men, tossed the arrow into the fire, and stalked gracefully to the other side of the camp.\n\u201cGreat Tehlu overroll me with your wings,\u201d Marten said, his hand falling away from his bowstring. \u201cProtect me from demons and creatures that walk in the night.\u201d\nOnly the fact that I was deep in the Heart of Stone kept me from a similar reaction. I turned back to the camp in time to see a small forest of bows being bent in our direction. I ducked my head and aimed a kick at the stupefied tracker, knocking him over as the arrows hummed past. He tumbled over, his quiver of arrows scattering down the muddy bank.\n\u201cTempi?\u201d I called.\n\u201cHere,\u201d he replied from off to my left. \u201cAesh. No arrow.\u201d\nMore arrows sang overhead, a few of them sticking into trees. Soon they", "would get the range and start arcing the arrows overhead so they fell on us from above. A thought came to me as calmly as a bubble rising to the surface of a pond. \u201cTempi, bring me this man\u2019s bow.\u201d\n\u201cIa.\u201d\nI heard Marten muttering something, his voice low, urgent, and indistinct. At first I thought he\u2019d been shot, then I realized he was praying. \u201cTehlu shelter me from iron and anger,\u201d he murmured softly. \u201cTehlu keep me safe from demons in the night.\u201d\nTempi pushed the bow into my hand. I took a deep breath and broke my mind into two pieces, then three, then four. In each piece of my mind I held the bowstring. I forced myself to relax and broke my mind again, five. I tried again and failed. Tired, wet and cold, I had reached my limit. I heard bowstrings thrum again and arrows hit the ground around us like a heavy rain. I felt a tug on the outside of my arm near my shoulder as one of the arrows grazed me before burying itself in the dirt. There was a stinging, then a burning pain.\nI pushed the pain away and set my teeth. Five would have to be enough. I drew my knife lightly across the back of my own arm, just enough to draw a little blood, then mouthed the proper bindings and drew the blade across the bowstring, hard.\nThe string held for a terrifying moment, then parted. The bow jerked in my hand, jolting my wounded arm before it flew out of my grasp. Cries of pain and dismay came over the ridge, letting me know I\u2019d been at least partly successful. Hopefully all five strings had been severed, leaving us with only one or two bowmen to deal with.\nBut as soon as the bow flung itself out of my grasp, I felt the cold leech into me. Not just my arms, but all the way through me: stomach, chest, and throat. I had known I couldn\u2019t trust the strength of my arm alone to make it through five bowstrings at once. So I had used the only fire that is always with an arcanist, the heat of my blood. Binder\u2019s chills would have me soon. If I didn\u2019t find a way to get warm, I would lapse into shock, then hypothermia, then death.\nI fell out of the Heart of Stone and let the pieces of my mind slide back together, reeling a bit in confusion. Chill, wet, and dizzy, I clawed my way back to the top of the ridgeline. The rain felt cold as sleet on my skin.\nI saw only one bowman. Unfortunately, he had kept his wits about him, and as soon as my face appeared over the top of the ridge, he drew and let fly", "in a smooth motion.\nA gust of wind saved me. His arrow struck harsh yellow sparks from a\nstone outcrop not two feet from my head. Rain pelted my face and lightning spidered across the sky. I pushed myself back down out of sight and stabbed the sentry\u2019s body over and over in a delirious rage.\nFinally, I struck a buckle and the blade snapped. Panting, I dropped the broken knife. I came back to my senses with the sound of Marten\u2019s forlorn praying in my ears. My limbs felt cold as lead, heavy and awkward.\nWorse than that, I could feel the numb sluggishness of hypothermia creeping through me. I realized I wasn\u2019t shivering, and knew it was a bad sign. I was soaking wet with no fire nearby to call my own.\nLightning etched the sky again. I had an idea. I laughed a terrible laugh.\nI looked over the top of the ridge and was pleased to see no bowmen. But the leader was barking new orders and I didn\u2019t doubt new bows would be found or strings replaced. Worse, they might simply abandon their shelter and overrun us with sheer numbers. There were easily a dozen men still standing.\nMarten still lay praying on the bank. \u201cTehlu who the fire could not kill, watch over me in fire.\u201d\nI kicked at him. \u201cGet up here damn you, or we\u2019re all dead.\u201d He paused in his praying and looked up. I shouted something incomprehensible and leaned over to drag him upward by the scruff of his shirt. I shook him hard and thrust his bow at him with my other hand, not knowing how it had come to be there.\nLightning flashed again and showed me what he saw. My hands and arms were covered with the sentry\u2019s blood. The pelting rain made it streak and run, but hadn\u2019t washed it away. It looked black in the brief, glaring light.\nMarten took his bow numbly. \u201cShoot the tree,\u201d I shouted over the thunder. He looked at me as if I had gone mad. \u201cShoot it!\u201d\nSomething in my expression must have convinced him, but his arrows were scattered, and he took up his litany again as he searched the muddy bank for one. \u201cTehlu who held Encanis to the wheel, watch over me in darkness.\u201d\nAfter a long moment of searching he found an arrow and fumbled to fit it to his string with trembling hands, praying all the while. I turned my attention back to the camp. Their leader had brought them back under control. I could see his mouth shouting orders, but all I could hear was the sound of Marten\u2019s trembling voice:", "Tehlu, whose eyes are true, Watch over me.\nSuddenly the leader paused and cocked his head. He held himself perfectly still as if listening to something. Marten continued praying:\nTehlu, son of yourself, Watch over me.\nTheir leader looked quickly to the left and right, as if he had heard something that disturbed him. He cocked his head again. \u201cHe can hear you!\u201d I shouted madly at Marten. \u201cShoot! He\u2019s getting them ready to do something!\u201d\nMarten took aim at the tree in the center of the camp. Wind buffeted him as he continued to pray.\nTehlu who was Menda who you were. Watch over me in Menda\u2019s name,\nIn Perial\u2019s name\nIn Ordal\u2019s name\nIn Andan\u2019s name Watch over me.\nTheir leader turned his head as if to search the sky for something. Something about the motion seemed terribly familiar, but my thoughts were growing muddy as binder\u2019s chills tightened their grip. The bandit leader turned and bounded for the tent, disappearing inside. \u201cShoot the tree!\u201d I screamed.\nHe let the arrow fly, and I saw it wedge firmly into the trunk of the massive oak that loomed in the center of the bandit\u2019s camp. I scrabbled in the mud for one of Marten\u2019s scattered arrows and began to laugh at what I was going to attempt. It might do nothing. It might kill me. The slippage alone ... But it didn\u2019t matter. I was dead already unless I found a way to get warm and dry. I would go into shock soon. Perhaps I was already there.\nMy hand closed on an arrow. I broke my mind six ways and shouted my bindings as I drove it deep into the sodden ground. \u201cAs above, so below!\u201d I shouted, making a joke only someone from the University could hope to understand.", "A second passed. The wind faded.\nThere was a whiteness. A brightness. A noise. I was falling. Then nothing.", "CHAPTER NINETY-TWO\nTaborlin the Great\nI WOKE. I WAS WARM and dry. It was dark.\nI heard a familiar voice questioning. Marten\u2019s voice, \u201cIt was all him. He\ndid it.\u201d\nQuestioning.\n\u201cI won\u2019t never say, Den. I swear to God I won\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to think of it.\nGet him to tell you if you want.\u201d\nQuestioning.\n\u201cYou\u2019d know if you\u2019d seen. Then you wouldn\u2019t want to know no more.\nDon\u2019t cross him. I\u2019ve seen him angry. That\u2019s all I\u2019ll say. Don\u2019t cross him.\u201d Questioning.\n\u201cLeave off, Den. He was killing them one by one. Then he went a little\ncrazy. He ... No. All I\u2019ll say is this. I think he called the lighting down. Like God himself.\u201d\nLike Taborlin the Great, I thought. And smiled. And slept.", "CHAPTER NINETY-THREE\nMercenaries All\nAFTER FOURTEEN HOURS OF sleep I was fit as a fiddle. My companions seemed surprised by this, as they\u2019d found me unconscious, cold to the touch, and covered in blood. They had stripped me, rubbed my limbs a bit, then rolled me in blankets and put me inside the bandits\u2019 single surviving tent. The other five had been either burned, buried, or lost when a great white pillar of lightning blasted the tall oak that stood at the center of the bandits\u2019 camp.\nThe next day was overcast but blessedly free of rain. First we tended to our hurts. Hespe had taken an arrow in the leg when the sentry had surprised them. Dedan had a deep gash along one of his shoulders, which was fairly lucky, considering he\u2019d rushed the sentry bare-handed. When I asked him about it, he said he simply hadn\u2019t had time to draw his sword.\nMarten had an angry red lump on his forehead above one eyebrow, either from when I had kicked him over or dragged him around. It was tender to the touch, but he claimed he had gotten worse a dozen times in tavern brawls.\nAfter I recovered from the chills I was fine. I could tell my companions were surprised by my sudden return from the doors of death and decided to leave them to their amazement. A little mystery wouldn\u2019t hurt my reputation.\nI bandaged the ragged cut where the arrow had grazed my shoulder and tended to a few bruises and scrapes I didn\u2019t remember receiving. I also had the long, shallow cut I had made on the top of my arm, but it was barely worth stitches.\nTempi was unhurt, unruffled, unreadable.\nOur second order of business was to tend to the dead. While I had been unconscious the rest of the group had pulled most of the burned, lifeless bodies to one side of the clearing. They tallied thus:\nOne sentry, killed by Dedan.\nTwo who had surprised Tempi in the forest.\nThree who had survived the lightning and tried to escape. Marten brought\none down, Tempi claimed the other two.", "Seventeen burned, broken, or otherwise ravaged by the lightning. Of those, eight had been dead, or wounded unto death, beforehand.\nWe found tracks of one sentry who had watched the whole incident from the northeast piece of the ridge. His tracks were a day old before we found them, and none of us felt the slightest desire to hunt him down. Dedan pointed out he might be worth more alive if he spread word of this spectacular defeat to others who were thinking of banditry as a way of life. For once we agreed on something.\nThe leader\u2019s body was not among those gathered. The large tent he had ducked into had been crushed beneath large sections of the huge oak\u2019s blasted trunk. Having more than enough to occupy us for the time being, we left his remains alone for now.\nRather than try to dig twenty-three graves, or even a mass grave large enough for twenty-three bodies, we built a pyre and kindled it while the surrounding forest was still wet with rain. I used my skills to ensure it burned hot and hard.\nBut there was one other: the sentry Marten had shot and I had put to use. While my companions were busy collecting wood for the pyre I went over the south side of the ridge and found where Tempi had hidden him away, covered with a fir branch.\nI looked at the body for a long time before I carried it away to the south. I found a quiet place under a willow and built a cairn of stones. Then I crept into the underbrush and was quietly, violently sick.\nThe lightning? Well, the lightning is difficult to explain. A storm overhead. A galvanic binding with two similar arrows. An attempt to ground the tree more strongly than any lightning rod. Honestly, I don\u2019t know if I can take credit for the lightning striking when and where it did. But as far as stories go, I called the lightning and it came.\nFrom the stories the others told, when the lightning struck it wasn\u2019t a single startling bolt, but several in quick succession. Dedan described it as \u201ca pillar of white fire,\u201d and said it shook the ground hard enough to knock him off his feet.\nRegardless of why, the towering oak was reduced to a charred stump about\n \nthe height of a greystone. Huge pieces of it lay scattered about. Smaller trees and shrubs had caught fire and been doused by the rain. Most of the long planks the bandits had used for their fortifications had exploded into pieces no bigger than the tip of your finger or burned to charcoal. Streaking out from the base of the tree were great tracks of churned-up earth, making the clearing look as if it had been plowed by a madman or raked by the claws of some huge beast.\nDespite this, we stayed at the bandit\u2019s camp for three days following our victory. The stream provided easy water, and what remained of the bandits\u2019 provisions were superior to our own. What\u2019s more, after we salvaged some lumber and canvas, each of us had the luxury of a tent or lean-to.\nWith our job completed, the tensions plaguing our group faded. The rain stopped, and we didn\u2019t need to be bashful about our fires anymore, and as a result Marten\u2019s cough was improving. Dedan and Hespe were civil to each other, and Dedan stopped about three-quarters of his incessant jackassery toward me.\nBut despite the relief at our job being done, things weren\u2019t entirely comfortable. There were no stories at night, and Marten distanced himself from me whenever he could. I could hardly blame him, considering what he had seen.\nWith that in mind, I took the first chance I had to privately destroy the wax mommets I had made. I had no use for them now, and I feared what might happen if one of my companions discovered them in my travelsack.\nTempi made no comment on what I\u2019d done with the bandit\u2019s body, and from what I could tell, he didn\u2019t seem to hold it against me. Looking back, I realize how little I truly understood the Adem. But at the time, all I noticed was that Tempi spent less time helping me practice the Ketan, and more time practicing our language and discussing the ever-confusing concept of the Lethani.\nWe fetched our equipment from our previous camp on the second day. I was relieved to have my lute back, and doubly glad to find Denna\u2019s marvelous case had stayed dry and tight despite the endless rain.\nAnd, since we were no longer slinking about, I played. For a solid day I did little else. It had been nearly a month since I had made any music, and I\u2019d missed it more than you can imagine.\nAt first I thought Tempi didn\u2019t care for my music. Aside from the fact that I\u2019d somehow insulted him by singing early on, he always left camp when I", "brought out my lute. Then I began to catch glimpses of him watching me, though always from a distance and usually at least partly hidden from sight. Once I knew to look for him, I discovered he was always listening while I played. Wide-eyed as an owl. Motionless as a stone.\nOn the third day, Hespe decided her leg could stand a little walking. So we had to decide what was going to come with us, and what would get left behind.\nIt wasn\u2019t going to be as difficult as it might have been. Most of the bandits\u2019 equipment had been destroyed by the lightning, the falling tree, or exposure to the storm. But there were still valuables to be salvaged from the ruined camp.\nWe had been prevented from making a good search of the leader\u2019s tent, as it had been crushed beneath one of the huge branches of the fallen oak. Over two feet thick, the fallen limb was larger than most trees in its own right. However, on the third day we finally managed to hatchet enough of it away so we could roll it off the wreckage of the tent.\nI was anxious to get a closer look at the leader\u2019s body, as something about him had been nagging my memory ever since I saw him step from the tent. And, in a more worldly vein, I knew his chain mail was worth at least a dozen talents.\nBut we didn\u2019t find any sign of the leader at all. It gave us a bit of a puzzle. Marten had only found one set of tracks leading away from the camp, those of the escaped sentry. None of us could guess where the leader had gone.\nTo me it was a puzzle and an annoyance, as I had been wanting to get a clearer look at his face. Dedan and Hespe believed he\u2019d simply escaped in the chaos following the lighting, maybe using the stream to avoid leaving tracks.\nMarten, however, grew distinctly uneasy when we didn\u2019t find his body. He murmured something about demons and refused to go near the wreckage. I thought he was being a superstitious fool, but I won\u2019t deny that I found the missing body more than slightly unnerving as well.\nInside the ruined tent we found a table, a cot, a desk, and a pair of chairs, all shattered and useless. In the ruined desk there were some papers I would have given a good deal to read, but they had spent too long in the wet, and the ink had run. There was also a heavy hardwood box slightly smaller than a loaf of bread. Alveron\u2019s family crest was enameled on the cover, and it was locked tight.\nBoth Hespe and Marten admitted they had a little skill at opening locks,", "and, since I was curious about what was inside, I let them have a go so long as they didn\u2019t damage the lock. Each of them took a long turn at it, but neither met with any success.\nAfter about twenty minutes of careful fiddling, Marten threw up his hands. \u201cI can\u2019t find the trick for it,\u201d he said as he stretched, pressing his hands against the small of his back.\n\u201cI might as well have a try myself,\u201d I said. I\u2019d hoped one of them would trick it open. Picking locks is not the sort of skill an arcanist should pride himself on. It didn\u2019t fit with the reputation I was hoping to build for myself.\n\u201cWill you now?\u201d Hespe said, raising an eyebrow at me. \u201cYou really are a young Taborlin.\u201d\nI thought back to the story Marten had told days before. \u201cOf course,\u201d I laughed, then shouted, \u201cEdro!\u201d in my best Taborlin the Great voice and struck the top of the box with my hand.\nThe lid sprung open.\nI was surprised as everyone else, but I hid it better. What had obviously happened is that one of them had actually tripped the lock, but the lid had been stuck. Probably the wood had swollen as it lay for days in the damp. When I\u2019d struck it, it had simply come loose.\nBut they didn\u2019t know that. From the looks on their faces you would think I had just transmuted gold in front of them. Even Tempi raised an eyebrow.\n\u201cNice trick, Taborlin,\u201d Hespe said, as if she weren\u2019t sure if I were playing a joke on them.\nI decided to hold my tongue and slid my set of makeshift lockpicks back into the pocket of my cloak. If I was going to be an arcanist, I might as well be a famous arcanist.\nDoing my best to radiate an air of solemn power, I lifted the lid and looked inside. The first thing I saw was a thick, folded piece of paper. I pulled it out.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Dedan asked.\nI held it for all of them to see. It was a careful map of the surrounding area, featuring not only an accurate depiction of the curving highway, but the locations of nearby farms and streams. Crosson, Fenhill, and the Pennysworth Inn were marked and labeled on the western road.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Dedan asked, gesturing with a thick finger to an unlabeled X deep in the forest on the south side of the road.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s this camp,\u201d Marten said, pointing. \u201cRight next to that stream.\u201d I nodded. \u201cIf this is right, we\u2019re closer to Crosson than I thought. We could", "just head southeast from here, and save ourselves more than a day\u2019s walking.\u201d I looked at Marten. \u201cDoes that seem right to you?\u201d\n\u201cHere. Let me see.\u201d I handed him the map and he looked it over. \u201cIt looks like it,\u201d he agreed. \u201cI didn\u2019t think we had come that far south. We\u2019d save at least two dozen miles going that way.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s no small blessing,\u201d Hespe said, rubbing at her bandaged leg. \u201cThat is, unless one of you gentlemen would like to carry me.\u201d\nI turned my attention back to the lockbox. It was full of tightly wrapped cloth packages. Lifting one out, I saw the glint of gold.\nThere was a murmur from everyone present. I checked the rest of the small, heavy bundles and was greeted with more coins, all gold. At a rough count, there were over two hundred royals. While I\u2019d never actually held one, I knew a single gold royal was worth eighty bits, almost as much as the Maer had given me to finance this entire trip. No wonder the Maer had been eager to stop the waylaying of his tax collectors.\nI juggled numbers in my head, converting the contents of the box to a more familiar currency and came up with more than five hundred silver talents. Enough money to buy a good-sized roadside inn, or an entire farmstead with all the livestock and equipage included. With that much money you could buy yourself a minor title, a court appointment, or an officer\u2019s position in the military.\nI saw everyone else making their own calculations. \u201cHow about we share a little bit of that around?\u201d Dedan said without much hope.\nI hesitated, then reached into the box. \u201cDoes a royal each seem fair to everyone?\u201d\nEveryone was silent as I unwrapped one of the bundles. Dedan looked at me incredulously. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d\nI handed him a heavy coin. \u201cThe way I see it, less scrupulous people might forget to tell Alveron about this. Or they\u2019d never go back to Alveron at all. I think a royal each is a good reward for us being such honest folk.\u201d I tossed Marten and Hespe a bright gold coin each.\n\u201cBesides,\u201d I added, tossing a royal to Tempi. \u201cI was hired to find a group of bandits, not destroy a minor military encampment.\u201d I held up my royal. \u201cThis is our bonus for services beyond the call of duty.\u201d I slid it into my pocket and patted it. \u201cAlveron need never know about it.\u201d\nDedan laughed and clapped me on the back. \u201cYou\u2019re not so much different from the rest of us after all,\u201d he said.", "I returned his smile and pressed the lid of the box closed, hearing the lock click tightly into place.\nI didn\u2019t mention the two other reasons for what I did. First, I was effectively buying their loyalty. They couldn\u2019t help but realize how easy it would be to simply grab the box and disappear. The thought had crossed my mind, too. Five hundred talents would pay my way through the University for the next ten years with plenty to spare.\nNow, however, they were considerably richer, and they got to feel honest about it. A heavy piece of gold would keep their minds off the money I was carrying. Though I still planned on sleeping with the locked box under my pillow at night.\nSecond, I could use the money. Both the royal I had tucked openly into my pocket, and the other three I\u2019d palmed when handing out coins to the others. As I said, Alveron would never know the difference, and four royals would cover a full term\u2019s tuition at the University.\nAfter I secured the Maer\u2019s lockbox in the bottom of my travelsack, each of us decided what we would scavenge from the bandits\u2019 equipment.\nThe tents we left for the same reason we hadn\u2019t brought our own in the first place. They were too bulky to carry. We took as much of their food as we could stow, knowing the more we carried, the less we would have to buy.\nI decided to take one of the bandits\u2019 swords. I wouldn\u2019t have wasted the money to buy one, since I didn\u2019t know how to use it, but if they were free for the taking....\nAs I was looking over the assorted weapons, Tempi came over and gave a few words of advice. After we had narrowed my options to two swords, Tempi finally spoke his mind. \u201cYou cannot use a sword.\u201d Questioning. Embarrassment.\nI got the impression that to him, the thought of someone not being able to use a sword was more than slightly shameful. Like not knowing how to eat using a knife and fork. \u201cNo,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cBut I was hoping you could show me.\u201d\nTempi stood very still and quiet. I might have taken it for a refusal if I had not come to know him so well. This type of stillness meant he was thinking.\n \nPauses are a key part of Ademic conversation, so I waited patiently. The two of us stood quietly for a minute, then two. Then five. Then ten. I fought to stay still and quiet. Perhaps this was a polite refusal.\nI thought myself terribly savvy, you see. I had known Tempi for nearly a month, learned a thousand words and fifty pieces of the Adem hand-speech. I knew the Adem were not bashful about nudity, or touching, and I was beginning to grasp the mystery that was the Lethani.\nOh yes, I thought I was terribly clever. Had I truly known anything about the Adem, I never would have dared to ask Tempi such a question.\n\u201cWill you teach me that?\u201d He pointed across the camp to where my lute case lay, leaning against a tree.\nI was caught off guard by the question. I had never tried to teach anyone how to play the lute before. Perhaps Tempi knew this and was implying something similar about himself. I knew he was prone to subtly layered speaking.\nA fair offer. I nodded. \u201cI will try.\u201d\nTempi nodded and pointed to one of the swords we had been considering. \u201cWear it. But no fighting.\u201d With that he turned and left. At the time I took this for his natural brevity.\nThe scavenging continued throughout the day. Marten took a good number of arrows and all the bowstrings he could find. Then, after checking to see no one wanted any of them, he decided to take the four longbows that had survived the lightning. They made an awkward bundle, but he claimed they\u2019d be worth a heavy penny when he sold them in Crosson.\nDedan grabbed a pair of boots and an armored vest nicer than the one he was wearing. He also laid claim to a deck of cards and a set of ivory dice.\nHespe took a slender set of shepherd\u2019s pipes and tucked almost a dozen knives into the bottom of her pack with the hope of selling them later.\nEven Tempi found some things he fancied: a whetstone, a brass saltbox, and a pair of linen pants he took down to the stream and dyed a familiar blood-red.\nI took less than the rest of them. A small knife to replace the one I\u2019d broken and a small shaving razor with a horn handle. I didn\u2019t need to shave that often, but I\u2019d gotten into the habit while in the Maer\u2019s court. I might have followed Hespe\u2019s example and taken a few knives as well, but my travelsack was already unpleasantly heavy with the weight of the Maer\u2019s lockbox.\nThis may seem a little ghoulish, but it is simply the way of the world.", "Looters become looted, while time and tide make us mercenaries all.", "CHAPTER NINETY-FOUR\nOver Rock and Root\nWE DECIDED TO TRUST the map we\u2019d found and cut straight west through the forest, heading toward Crosson. Even if we missed the town, we couldn\u2019t help but hit the road and save ourselves long miles of walking.\nHespe\u2019s wounded leg made the going slow, and we only put six or seven miles behind us that first day. It was during one of our many breaks that Tempi began my true instruction in the Ketan.\nFool that I was, I\u2019d assumed he had already been teaching me. The truth was, he had merely been correcting my more horrifying mistakes because they irritated him. Much the same way I\u2019d be tempted to tune someone\u2019s lute if they were playing off-key in the same room.\nThis instruction was a different thing entirely. We started at the beginning of the Ketan and he corrected my mistakes. All my mistakes. He found eighteen in the first motion alone, and there are more than a hundred motions in the Ketan. I quickly began to have doubts about this apprenticeship.\nI also began to teach Tempi the lute. I played notes as we walked, and taught him their names, then showed him some chords. It seemed as good a place as any to begin.\nWe hoped to make it to Crosson by noon of the next day. But near midmorning we encountered a stretch of dreary, reeking swamp that hadn\u2019t been marked on the map.\nThus began a truly miserable day. We had to test our footing with every step, and our progress slowed to a crawl. At one point Dedan startled and fell, thrashing about and spattering the rest of us with brackish water. He said he\u2019d seen a mosquito bigger than his thumb with a sucker like a woman\u2019s hairpin. I suggested it might have been a sipquick. He suggested several unpleasant, unsanitary things I could do to myself at my earliest convenience.\nAs the afternoon wore on, we gave up on making it back to the road and focused on more immediate things, such as finding a piece of dry ground where we could sit without sinking. But all we found was more marsh,", "sinkholes, and clouds of keening mosquitoes and biting flies.\nThe sun began to set before we finally made our way out of the swamp,\nand the weather quickly turned from hot and muggy to chill and damp. We trudged until the ground finally began to slope upward. And though we were all weary and wet, we unanimously decided to press on and put a little distance between ourselves and the insects and smell of rotting plants.\nThe moon was full, giving us more than enough light to pick our way through the trees. Despite the miserable day, our spirits began to rise. Hespe had grown tired enough to lean on Dedan, and as the mud-covered mercenary put an arm around her she told him he hadn\u2019t smelled this good in months. He replied that he would have to bow to the judgment of a woman of such obvious grace.\nI tensed, waiting for their banter to turn sour and sarcastic. But as I plodded along behind them I noticed how gently he had his arm around her. Hespe leaned on him almost tenderly, hardly favoring her wounded leg at all. I glanced at Marten, and the old tracker smiled, his teeth white in the moonlight.\nBefore long we found a clear stream and washed the worst of the smell and mud away. We rinsed out our clothes and donned dry ones. I unpacked my tatty, threadbare cloak and fastened it across my chest, vainly hoping it might keep away the evening\u2019s chill.\nAs we were finishing up, we heard the faint sound of singing upstream. Each of us pricked up our ears, but the chattering sound of the stream made it difficult to hear with any clarity.\nBut singing meant people, and people meant we were almost to Crosson, or perhaps even the Pennysworth if the swamp had turned us too far south. Even a farmhouse would be better than another night in the rough.\nSo, despite the fact that we were tired and aching, the hope of soft beds, warm meals, and cool drinks gave us energy to gather up our packs and press on.\nWe followed the stream, Dedan and Hespe still walking as a pair. The sound of singing came and went. The recent rains meant the stream was running high, and the noise of it tumbling over rock and root was sometimes enough to drown out even the sound of our own footsteps.\nEventually the stream grew broad and still as the heavy brush thinned and opened into a wide clearing.\nThere was no singing any longer. Nor did we see a road, inn, or any flicker", "of firelight. Just a wide clearing well-lit by moonlight. The stream broadened out, forming a bright pool. And sitting on a smooth rock by the side of the pool....\n\u201cLord Tehlu protect me from the demons of the night,\u201d Marten said woodenly. But he sounded more reverent than afraid. And he did not look away.\n\u201cThat\u2019s ...\u201d Dedan said weakly. \u201cThat\u2019s ...\u201d\n\u201cI do not believe in faeries,\u201d I tried to say, but it came out as barely a whisper.\nIt was Felurian.", "CHAPTER NINETY-FIVE\nChased\nTHE FIVE OF US stood frozen for a moment. The slow rippling of the pool reflected onto the fair form of Felurian. Naked in the moonlight, she sang:\ncae-lanion luhial di mari felanua kreata tu ciar\ntu alaran di. dirella. amauen. loesi an delian tu nia vor ruhlan Felurian thae.\nThe sound of her voice was strange. It was soft and gentle, far too quiet for us to hear across the entire length of the clearing. Far too faint for us to hear over the sound of moving water and stirring leaves. Despite this, I could hear it. Her words were clear and sweet as the rising and falling notes of a distant flute. It reminded me of something I could not press my finger to.\nThe tune was the same Dedan had sung in his story. I did not understand a word of it save her name in the final line. Nevertheless I felt the draw of it, inexplicable and insistent. As if an unseen hand had reached into my chest and tried to pull me into the clearing by my heart.\nI resisted. I looked away and set one hand against a nearby tree to steady myself.\nBehind me I heard Marten murmuring, \u201cNo no no,\u201d in a low voice as if he were trying to convince himself. \u201cNo no no no no. Not for all the money in the world.\u201d\nI looked over my shoulder. The tracker\u2019s eyes were fixed feverishly on the clearing in front of him, but he seemed more afraid than aroused. Tempi stood, surprise plain on his normally impassive face. Dedan stood rigidly to", "one side, his face drawn while Hespe\u2019s eyes darted back and forth between him and the clearing.\nThen Felurian began to sing again. It felt like the promise of a warm hearth on a cold night. It was like a young girl\u2019s smile. I found myself thinking of Losi at the Pennysworth, her red curls like a tumble of fire. I remembered the swell of her breasts and the way her hand had felt running through my hair.\nFelurian sang, and I felt the pull of it. It was strong, but not so strong that I couldn\u2019t hold myself back. I looked into the clearing again and saw her, skin silver-white under the evening sky. She bent to dip one hand in the water of the pool, more graceful than a dancer.\nA sudden clarity of thought came over me. What was I afraid of? A faerie story? There was magic here, real magic. What\u2019s more, it was a magic of singing. If I missed this opportunity I would never forgive myself.\nI looked back again at my companions. Marten was shaking visibly. Tempi was backing slowly away. Dedan\u2019s hands made fists at his sides. Was I going to be like them, superstitious and afraid? No. Never. I was of the Arcanum. I was a namer. I was one of the Edema Ruh.\nI felt wild laughter boil up in me. \u201cI will meet you at the Pennysworth in three days\u2019 time,\u201d I said, and stepped into the clearing.\nI felt Felurian\u2019s pull more strongly now. Her skin was bright in the moonlight. Her long hair fell like a shadow all around her.\n\u201cSod this,\u201d I heard Dedan say behind me. \u201cIf he\u2019s going, then I\u2019m g\u2014\u201d There was a short scuffle ending with the sound of something hitting the ground. I glanced behind me and saw him facedown on the low grass. Hespe had her knee on the small of his back and one of his arms pulled up tight behind him. He was struggling weakly and cursing strongly.\nTempi watched them impassively, as if scoring a wrestling bout. Marten was gesturing frantically in my direction. \u201cKid,\u201d he hissed urgently. \u201cGet back here! Kid! Come back!\u201d\nI turned back to the stream. Felurian was watching me. Even from a hundred feet away, I could see her eyes, dark and curious. Her mouth spread into a wide, dangerous smile. She laughed a wild laugh. It was bright and delighted. It was no human sound.\nThen she darted across the clearing, swift as a sparrow, graceful as a deer. I leapt to the chase, and despite the weight of my travelsack and the sword at my hip, I moved so quickly my cloak flared like a flag behind me. Never have I run like that before, and never since. It was the way a child runs, light", "and quick, without the least fear of falling.\nFelurian ahead of me. Into the scrub. I dimly remember trees, the smell of\nearth, the grey of moonlit stone. She laughs. She dodges, dances, pulls ahead. She waits till I am almost close enough to touch, then skips away. She shines in the light of the moon. There are clutching branches, a spray of water, a warm wind ...\nAnd I have hold of her. Her hands are tangled in my hair, pulling me close. Her mouth eager. Her tongue shy and darting. Her breath in my mouth, filling my head. The hot tips of her breasts brush my chest. The smell of her like clover, like musk, like ripe apples fallen to the ground ...\nAnd there is no hesitation. No doubt. I know exactly what to do. My hands are on the back of her neck. Brushing her face. Tangled in her hair. Sliding along the smooth length of her thigh. Grabbing her hard by the flank. Circling her narrow waist. Lifting her. Laying her down ...\nAnd she writhes beneath me, lithe and languorous. Slow and sighing. Her legs around me. Her back arches. Her hot hands clutch my shoulders, my arms, pressing the small of my back ...\nAnd she is astride me. Her movements wild. Her long hair trails across my skin. She tosses her head, trembling and shaking, crying out in a language I do not know. Her sharp nails digging into the flat muscles of my chest ...\nAnd there is music to it. The wordless cries she makes, rising and falling. Her sigh. My racing heart. Her motion slows. I clutch her hips in frantic counterpoint. Our rhythm is like a silent song. Like sudden thunder. Like the half-heard thrumming of a distant drum ...\nAnd everything stops. All of me arches. I am taut as a lute string. Trembling. Aching. I am tuned too tight, and I am breaking....", "CHAPTER NINETY-SIX\nThe Fire Itself\nI WOKE WITH SOMETHING BRUSHING at the edges of my memory. I opened my eyes and saw trees stretched against a twilight sky. There were silken pillows all around me, while a few feet away Felurian lay, her naked body loosely splayed in sleep.\nShe looked smooth and perfect as a sculpture. She sighed in her sleep, and I chided myself for the thought. I knew she was nothing like cold stone. She was warm and supple, the smoothest marble grindstone by comparison.\nMy hand reached out to touch her, but I stopped myself, not wanting to disturb the perfect scene before me. A distant thought began to nag at me, but I brushed it away like an irritating fly.\nFelurian\u2019s lips parted and sighed, making a sound like a dove. I remembered the touch of those lips. I ached, and forced myself to look away from her soft, flower-petal mouth.\nHer closed eyelids were patterned like a butterfly\u2019s wings, swept in whorls of deep purple and black with traceries of pale gold that blended to the color of her skin. As her eyes moved gently in sleep, the pattern shifted, as if the butterfly fanned its wings. That sight alone was probably worth the price all men must pay for seeing it.\nI ate her with my eyes, knowing all the songs and stories I had heard were nothing. She is what men dream of. All the places I have been, all the women I have seen, I have met her equal only once.\nSomething in my mind screamed at me, but I was bemused by the motion of her eyes beneath her lids, the shape her mouth made, as if she would kiss me even while she slept. I swatted the thought away again, irritated.\nI was going to go mad, or die.\nThe idea finally fought its way through to my conscious mind, and I felt every hair on my body stand suddenly on end. I had a moment of perfect, clear lucidity that resembled coming up for air and quickly closed my eyes, trying to lower myself into the Heart of Stone.", "It didn\u2019t come. For the first time in my life, that cool taciturn state escaped me. Behind my eyes, Felurian distracted me. The sweet breath. The soft breast. The urgent half-despairing sighs that slipped through hungry, petal- tender lips....\nStone. I kept my eyes closed and wrapped the calm rationality of Heart of Stone around me like a mantle before I dared even think of her again.\nWhat did I know? I brought to mind a hundred stories of Felurian and plucked out the recurring themes. Felurian was beautiful. She charmed mortal men. They followed her into the Fae and died in her embrace.\nHow did they die? It was fairly simple to guess: extreme physical stress. Things had been rather rigorous, and the sedentary or frail might not have fared so well as I. Now that I stopped to notice, my entire body felt like a well-wrung rag. My shoulders ached, my knees burned, and my neck bore the sweet bruising of love bites from my right ear, down my chest, and....\nMy body flushed and I struggled deeper into the Heart of Stone until my pulse slowed and I could force the thought of her from the front of my mind.\nI could remember four stories where men had come back from the Fae alive, all of them cracked as the potter\u2019s cobbles. What manner of madness did they exhibit? Obsessive behavior, accidental death due to separation from reality, and wasting away from extreme melancholy. Three died within a span of days. The fourth story told of the man lasting nearly half a year.\nBut something didn\u2019t make sense. Admittedly, Felurian was lovely. Skilled? Without a doubt. But to the extent that every man died or went insane? No. It simply wasn\u2019t likely.\nI don\u2019t mean to belittle the experience. I don\u2019t doubt for a second that it had, quite naturally, deprived men of their faculties in the past. I, however, knew myself to be quite sane.\nI briefly entertained the notion that I was insane and didn\u2019t know it. Then I considered the possibility that I had always been insane, acknowledged it as more likely than the former, then pushed both thoughts from my mind.\nEyes still closed, I lay there, enjoying a quiet languor of a sort I\u2019d never felt before. I savored the moment, then opened my eyes and prepared to make my escape.\nI looked around the pavilion at silken draperies and scattered cushions. These were only ornaments for Felurian. She lay in the middle of it all, all rounded hip and slender leg and lithe muscle shifting underneath her skin.\nShe was watching me.", "If she was beautiful at rest she was doubly so awake. Asleep she was a painting of a fire. Awake she was the fire itself.\nIt may seem strange to you that at this point I felt fear. It may seem strange that only an arm\u2019s length from the most attractive woman in the world, I was suddenly reminded of my own mortality.\nShe smiled like a knife in velvet and stretched like a cat in the sun.\nHer body was built to stretch, the arch of her back, the smooth expanse of her belly going taut. The round fullness of her breasts was lifted by the motion of her arms, and suddenly I felt like a stag in rut. My body reacted to her, and I felt as if someone were hammering at the cool impassivity of Heart of Stone with a hot poker. My control slipped for a moment, and a less disciplined piece of my mind started composing a song to her.\nI couldn\u2019t spare the attention to rein that piece of myself back in. So I focused on staying safe in the Heart of Stone, ignoring both her body and that nattering part of my mind forming rhyming couplets somewhere in the back of my head.\nIt wasn\u2019t the easiest thing to do. As a matter of fact, it made the ordinary rigors of sympathy seem simple as skipping. If not for the training I\u2019d received at the University, I would have been a broken, pitiful thing, only able to concentrate on my own captivation.\nFelurian slowly relaxed out of her stretch and looked at me with ancient eyes. Eyes unlike anything I had ever seen. They were a striking color ...\nThe summer dusk was in her eyes\n... a sort of twilight blue. They were fascinating. In fact ...\nWith lids of winged butterflies\n... there wasn\u2019t any white to them at all....\nHer lips the shade of sunset skies\nI clenched my jaw, split that chattering piece of myself away, and walled it off in a distant corner of my mind, letting it sing to itself.\nFelurian tilted her head to one side. Her eyes were as intent and expressionless as a bird\u2019s. \u201cwhy are you so quiet, flame lover? have I quenched you?\u201d\nHer voice was odd to my ear. It had no rough edges to it at all. It was all quiet smoothness, like a piece of perfectly polished glass. Despite its odd softness, Felurian\u2019s voice ran down my spine, making me feel like a cat that\u2019s just been stroked down to the tip of its tail.\nI retreated further into the Heart of Stone, felt it cool and reassuring around", "me. However, while the majority of my attention was focused on self-control, the small, mad, lyric part of my mind leapt to the fore and said: \u201cNever quenched. Though I am doused in you, I burn. The motion of your turning head is like a song. Is like a spark. Is like a breath that billows me and fans to flame a fire that cannot help but spread and roar your name.\u201d\nFelurian\u2019s face lit up. \u201ca poet! I should have known you for a poet by how your body moved.\u201d\nThe gentle hush of her voice caught me unprepared again. It wasn\u2019t that her words were breathy, or husky, or sultry. It was nothing so tawdry or affected as that. But when she spoke, I couldn\u2019t help but be aware of the fact that her breath was pressed from her breast, past the soft sweetness of her throat, then shaped by the careful play of lips and teeth and tongue.\nShe came closer, moving on her hands and knees through the pillows. \u201cyou looked like a poet, fiery and fair.\u201d Her voice was no louder than a breath as she cupped my face with her hands. \u201cpoets are gentler. they say nice things.\u201d\nThere was only one person I\u2019d ever heard whose voice was similar to this. Elodin. On rare occasions his voice would fill the air as if the world itself were listening.\nFelurian\u2019s voice was not resonant. It did not fill the forest glade. Hers was the hush before a sudden summer storm. It was soft as a brushing feather. It made my heart step sideways in my chest.\nSpeaking thus, when she called me a poet, it did not raise my hackles or make me grit my teeth. From her, it sounded like the sweetest thing a man was ever called. Such was the power of her voice.\nFelurian brushed her fingertips across my lips. \u201cpoet kisses are best. you kiss me like a candle flame.\u201d She brought one of her hands back to touch her mouth, her eyes bright at the memory.\nI took her hand and pressed it tenderly. My hands have always seemed graceful, but next to hers, they looked brutish and crude. I breathed against her palm as I spoke. \u201cYour kisses are like sunlight on my lips.\u201d\nShe lowered her eyes, butterfly wings dancing. I felt my mindless need for her slacken and began to understand. This was magic, but nothing like what I knew. Not sympathy or sygaldry. Felurian made men mad with desire the same way I gave off body heat. It was natural for her, but she could control it.\nHer gaze wandered over my tangle of clothes and belongings strewn messily at one corner of the glade. They looked oddly out of place amid the silks and soft colors. I saw her eyes settle on my lute case. She froze.", "\u201cis my flame a sweet poet? does he sing?\u201d Her voice trembled and I could feel a tenseness in her body as she waited for an answer. She looked back at me. I smiled.\nFelurian scampered off and brought back my lute case like a child with a new toy. As I took it, I saw her eyes were wide and ... wet?\nI looked into her eyes, and in a flash of understanding I realized what her life must be like. A thousand years old, and lonely from time to time. If she wanted companionship she had to seduce and lure. And for what? An evening of company? An hour? How long could an average man last before his will broke and he became as mindless as a fawning dog? Not long.\nAnd who would she meet in the forest? Farmers and hunters? What entertainment could they provide, slaved to her passions? I felt a moment of pity for her. I know what loneliness is like.\nI took the lute from its case and began to tune it. I struck an experimental chord and carefully tuned it again. What to play for the most beautiful woman in the world?\nIt wasn\u2019t hard to decide, actually. My father had taught me to judge an audience. I struck up \u201cSisters Flin.\u201d If you\u2019ve never heard of it, I\u2019m not surprised. It\u2019s a bright and lively song about two sisters gossiping while they argue over the price of butter.\nMost people want to hear stories of legendary adventure and romance. But what do you play for someone out of legend? What do you sing for a woman who has been the object of romance for a mortal age? You play her songs of ordinary people. So I hoped.\nShe clapped delightedly at the end of it. \u201cmore! more?\u201d She smiled hopefully, cocking her head to make it a request. Her eyes were wide and eager and adoring.\nI played her \u201cLarm and His Alepot.\u201d I played her \u201cBlacksmith\u2019s Daughters.\u201d I played her a ridiculous song about a priest chasing a cow that I\u2019d written when I was ten and never even named.\nFelurian laughed and applauded. She covered her mouth in shock and her eyes in embarrassment. The more I played, the more she reminded me of a young country wife attending her first fair, full of pure joy, face shining with innocent delight, eyes wide in amazement at everything she sees.\nAnd lovely, of course. I concentrated on my fingering so as not to think about it.\nAfter each song she rewarded me with a kiss that made it difficult to decide", "what to play next. Not that I minded horribly. I\u2019d come to realize rather quickly that I preferred kisses to coins.\nI played her \u201cTinker Tanner.\u201d Let me tell you, the image of Felurian, her quiet, fluting voice singing the chorus of my favorite drinking song is something that will never, never leave me. Not until I die.\nAll the while I felt the charm she had on me slacken, bit by bit. It gave me room to breathe. I relaxed and let myself slide a little farther out of the Heart of Stone. Dispassionate calm can be a useful frame of mind, but it does not make for a compelling performance.\nI played for hours, and by the end of it I felt like myself again. By which I mean I could look at Felurian with no more reaction than you might normally feel, looking at the most beautiful woman in the world.\nI can still remember her, sitting naked among the cushions, twilight- colored butterflies dancing in the air between us. I wouldn\u2019t have been alive had I not been aroused. But my mind seemed to be my own again, and I was grateful for that.\nShe made a disappointed noise of protest as I set the lute back into its case. \u201care you weary?\u201d she asked with a hint of a smile. \u201cI would not have tired you, sweet poet, had I known.\u201d\nI gave my best apologetic smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but it seems to be getting late.\u201d Actually, the sky still showed the same purple hint of twilight it had since I first woke, but I pushed on. \u201cI\u2019ll need to be moving quickly if I\u2019m to meet ...\u201d\nMy mind went numb as quickly as if I\u2019d been struck a blow to the back of my head. I felt the passion, fierce and insatiable. I felt the need to have her, to crush her body to mine, to taste the savage sweetness of her mouth.\nOnly because of my arcane training did I hold onto any concept of my own identity at all. Even so, I only held it with my barest fingertips.\nFelurian sat cross-legged on the cushions across from me, her face angry and terrible, her eyes cold and hard as distant stars. With a deliberate calm she brushed a slowly fanning butterfly from her shoulder. There was such a weight of fury in her simple gesture that my stomach clenched and I realized this fact:\nNo one ever left Felurian. Ever. She kept men until their bodies and minds broke beneath the strain of loving her. She kept them until she tired of them, and when she sent them away it was the leaving that drove men mad.\nI was powerless. I was a novelty. I was a toy, favorite because it was", "newest. It might be a long while before she tired of me, but the time would come. And when she finally set me free my mind would tear itself apart with wanting her.", "CHAPTER NINETY-SEVEN\nBlood and Bitter Rue\nASISAT AMONG the silks with my control slipping away, I felt a wave of cold sweat sweep over my body. I clenched my jaw and felt a small anger flare up. Over the course of my life my mind has been the only thing I\u2019ve always been able to rely on, the only thing that has always been entirely mine.\nI could feel my resolve melting as my natural desires were replaced by some animal thing unable to think beyond its own lust.\nThe part of me that was still Kvothe raged, but I felt my body respond to her presence. With a horrible fascination I felt myself crawl through the cushions toward her. One arm found her slender waist, and I bent to kiss her with a terrible hunger.\nI howled inside my own mind. I have been beaten and whipped, starved and stabbed. But my mind is my own, no matter what becomes of this body or the world around. I threw myself against the bars of an intangible cage made of moonlight and desire.\nAnd, somehow, I held myself away from her. My breath tore out of my throat as if racing to escape.\nFelurian reclined on the cushions, her head tilted up toward me. Her lips were pale and perfect. Her eyes half-lidded and hungry.\nI forced myself to look away from her face, but there was nowhere safe to look. Her throat was smooth and delicate, trembling with her rapid pulse. One breast stood round and full, while the other angled slightly to one side, following the downward slope of her body. They rose and fell with her breath, moving gently, making candle-cast shadows on her skin. I glimpsed the perfect whiteness of her teeth behind the pale pink of her parted lips....\nI closed my eyes, but somehow that only made it worse. The heat of her body was like standing near a fire. The skin of her waist was soft beneath my hand. She moved beneath me, and her breast brushed softly against my chest. I felt her breath against my neck. I shivered and began to sweat.", "I opened my eyes again and saw her staring at me. Her expression was innocent, almost hurt, as if she couldn\u2019t understand being refused. I nursed my small flame of anger. No one did this to me. No one. I held myself away from her. A slight line of a frown touched her forehead, as if she were annoyed, or angry, or concentrating.\nFelurian reached up to touch my face, her eyes intent as if trying to read something written deep inside me. I tried to pull back, remembering her touch, but my body simply shook. Beads of sweat fell from my skin to patter gently on the silk cushions and the flat plane of her stomach below.\nShe touched my cheek softly. Softly, I bent to kiss her, and something broke in my mind.\nI felt the snap as four years of my life slid away. Suddenly I was back on the streets of Tarbean. Three boys, bigger than me with greasy hair and piggish eyes had dragged me from the broken crate where I\u2019d been sleeping. Two of them held me down, pinning my arms. I lay in a stagnant puddle that was bitterly cold. It was early in the morning and the stars were out.\nOne of them had his hand over my mouth. It didn\u2019t matter. I had been in the city for months. I knew better than to yell for help. At best no one would come. At worst someone would, and then there would be more of them.\nTwo of them held me down. The third cut my clothes off my body. He cut me. They told me what they were going to do. Their breath was horribly warm against my face. They laughed.\nThere in Tarbean, half-naked and helpless, I felt something well up inside me. I bit two fingers off the hand over my mouth. I heard a scream and swearing as one of them staggered away. I strained and strained against the one who was still on top of me. I heard my own arm break, and his grip loosened. I started to howl.\nI threw him off. Still screaming I stood, my clothes hanging in rags around me. I knocked one of them to the ground. My scrabbling hand found a loose cobblestone and I used it to break one of his legs. I remember the noise it made. I flailed until his arms were broken, then I broke his head.\nWhen I looked up, I saw the one who had cut me was gone. The third huddled against a wall. He clutched his bloody hand to his chest. His eyes were white and wild. Then I heard footsteps approaching, and I dropped the stone and ran and ran and ran....\nSuddenly, years later, I was that feral boy again. I jerked my head back and snarled inside my mind. I felt something deep inside myself. I reached for it.", "A tense stillness settled inside of me, the sort of silence that comes before a thunderclap. I felt the air begin to crystallize around me.\nI felt cold. Detachedly, I gathered up the pieces of my mind and fit them all together. I was Kvothe the trouper, Edema Ruh born. I was Kvothe the student, Re\u2019lar under Elodin. I was Kvothe the musician. I was Kvothe.\nI stood above Felurian.\nI felt as if this was the only time in my life I had been fully awake. Everything looked clear and sharp, as if I was seeing with a new set of eyes. As if I wasn\u2019t bothering with my eyes at all, and was looking at the world directly with my mind.\nThe sleeping mind, some piece of me realized faintly. No longer sleeping, I thought and smiled.\nI looked at Felurian, and in that moment I understood her down to the bottoms of her feet. She was of the Fae. She did not worry over right or wrong. She was a creature of pure desire, much like a child. A child does not concern itself with consequence, neither does a sudden storm. Felurian resembled both, and neither. She was ancient and innocent and powerful and proud.\nWas this the way Elodin saw the world? Was this the magic he spoke of? Not secrets or tricks, but Taborlin the Great magic. Always there, but beyond my seeing until now?\nIt was beautiful.\nI met Felurian\u2019s eyes and the world grew slow and sluggish. I felt as if I had been thrust underwater, as if my breath had been pressed from my body. For that tiny moment I was stunned and numb as if I had been struck by lightning.\nThe moment passed and things began to move again. But now, looking into Felurian\u2019s twilight eyes, I understood her far beyond the bottoms of her feet. Now I knew her to the marrow of her bones. Her eyes were like four lines of music, clearly penned. My mind was filled with the sudden song of her. I drew a breath and sang it out in four hard notes.\nFelurian sat upright. She passed her hand before her eyes and spoke a word as sharp as shattered glass. There was a pain like thunder in my head. Darkness flickered at the edges of my sight. I tasted blood and bitter rue.\nThe world snapped back into focus, and I caught myself before I fell. Felurian frowned. Straightened. Stood. Her face intent, she took a step. Standing, she was not tall or terrible. Her head was barely level with my", "chin. Her dark hair hung, a sheaf of shadow, straight as a knife until it brushed against her curving hip. She was slight, and pale, and perfect. Never have I seen a face so sweet, a mouth so made for kissing. She was no longer frowning. Not smiling either. Her lips were soft and slightly parted.\nShe took another step. The simple motion of her moving leg was like a dance, the unexaggerated shifting of her hip entrancing as a fire. The arch of her bare foot said more of sex than anything I\u2019d seen in my young life.\nAnother step. Her smile was fierce and full. She was as lovely as the moon. Her power hung about her like a mantle. It shook the air. It spread behind her like a pair of vast and unseen wings.\nClose enough to touch, I felt her power thrumming in the air. Desire rose around me like the sea in storm. She raised her hand. She touched my chest. I shook.\nShe met my eyes, and in the twilight written there I saw again the four clear lines of song.\nI sang them out. They burst from me like birds into the open air.\nSuddenly my mind was clear again. I drew a breath and held her eyes in mine. I sang again, and this time I was full of rage. I shouted out the four hard notes of song. I sang them tight and white and hard as iron. And at the sound of them, I felt her power shake then shatter, leaving nothing in the empty air but ache and anger.\nFelurian gave a startled cry and sat so suddenly that it was almost like a fall. She curled her knees toward herself and huddled, watching me with wide and frightened eyes.\nLooking around, I saw the wind. Not the way you might see smoke or fog, I saw the ever-changing wind itself. It was familiar as the face of a forgotten friend. I laughed and spread my arms, marveling at its shifting shape.\nI cupped my hands and breathed a sigh into the hollow space within. I spoke a name. I moved my hands and wove my breath gossamer-thin. It billowed out, engulfing her, then burst into a silver flame that trapped her tight inside its changing name.\nI held her there above the ground. She watched me with an air of fear and disbelief, her dark hair dancing like a second flame inside the first.\nI knew then that I could kill her. It would be as simple as throwing a sheet of paper to the wind. But the thought sickened me, and I was reminded of ripping the wings from a butterfly. Killing her would be destroying something strange and wonderful. A world without Felurian was a poorer", "world. A world I would like a little less. It would be like breaking Illien\u2019s lute. It would be like burning down a library in addition to ending a life.\nOn the other hand, my safety and sanity were at stake. I believed the world was more interesting with Kvothe in it as well.\nBut I couldn\u2019t kill her. Not like this. Not wielding my newfound magic like a dissecting knife.\nI spoke again, and the wind brought her down among the pillows. I made a tearing motion and the silver flame that once had been my breath became three notes of broken song and went to play among the trees.\nI sat. She reclined. We looked each other over for several long minutes. Her eyes flashed from fear to caution to curiosity. I saw myself reflected in her eyes, naked among the cushions. My power rode like a white star on my brow.\nThen I began to feel a fading. A forgetting. I realized the name of the wind no longer filled my mouth, and when I looked around I saw nothing but empty air. I tried to remain outwardly calm, but as these things left me I felt like a lute whose strings were being cut. My heart clenched with a loss I hadn\u2019t felt since my parents died.\nI could see a slight shimmer in the air around Felurian, some shred of her power returning. I ignored it as I struggled frantically to keep some part of what I had learned. But it was like trying to hold a handful of sand. If you have ever dreamed of flying, then come awake, dismayed to realize you had lost the trick of it, you have some inkling how I felt.\nPiece by piece it faded until there was nothing left. I felt hollow inside and ached as badly as if I\u2019d discovered my family never loved me. I swallowed against the lump in my throat.\nFelurian looked at me curiously. I could still see myself reflected in her eyes, the star on my forehead no more than a pinprick of light. Then even the perfect vision of my sleeping mind began to fade. I looked desperately at the world around me. I tried to memorize the sight of it, unblinking.\nThen it was gone. I bowed my head, half in grief and half to hide the tears.", "CHAPTER NINETY-EIGHT\nThe Lay of Felurian\nA LONG MOMENT PASSED BEFORE I regained enough of my composure to look up. There was a hesitancy in the air, as if we were young lovers who didn\u2019t know what was expected of us next, who didn\u2019t know what parts we were supposed to play.\nI picked up my lute and brought it close to my chest. The motion was instinctive, like clutching a wounded hand. I struck a chord out of habit, then made it minor so the lute seemed to be saying sad.\nWithout thinking or looking up I began to play one of the songs I had written in the months after my parents died. It was called Sitting by the Water Remembering. My fingers strummed sorrow into the evening air. It was several minutes before I realized what I was doing, and several more before I stopped. I wasn\u2019t done with the song. I don\u2019t know if it really has an ending.\nI felt better, not good by any means, but better. Less empty. My music always helped. As long as I had my music, no burden was ever too heavy to bear.\nI looked up and saw tears on Felurian\u2019s face. It made me less ashamed of my own.\nI also felt myself wanting her. The emotion was damped by the ache in my chest, but that touch of desire focused my attention on my most immediate concern. Survival. Escape.\nFelurian seemed to reach a decision and started through the cushions toward me. Moving in a cautious crawl, she stopped several feet away and looked at me.\n\u201cdoes my tender poet have a name?\u201d Her voice was so gentle it startled me.\nI opened my mouth to speak, then stopped. I thought of the moon, caught by her own name, and a thousand faerie stories I had heard as a child. If you believed Elodin, names were the bones of the world. I hesitated for about half a second before I decided I had given Felurian a damn sight more than my name already.", "\u201cI am Kvothe.\u201d The sound of it seemed to ground me, to put me inside myself again.\n\u201ckvothe.\u201d She spoke it softly, and it reminded me of a bird calling. \u201cwould you sing sweet for me again?\u201d She reached out slowly, as if afraid of being burned, and laid her hand lightly on my arm. \u201cplease? your songs are like a caress, my kvothe.\u201d\nShe pronounced my name like the beginning of a song. It was lovely. However, I wasn\u2019t entirely comfortable with the way she referred to me as her Kvothe.\nI smiled and nodded. Mostly because I didn\u2019t have a better idea. I struck a couple of tuning chords, then paused, thinking.\nThen I started to play \u201cIn the Forest Fae,\u201d a song about, of all things, Felurian herself. It wasn\u2019t particularly good. It used about three chords and two dozen words. But it had the effect I was looking for.\nFelurian brightened at the mention of her name. There was no false modesty in her. She knew she was most beautiful, most skilled. She knew men told stories, and she knew her reputation. No man could resist her, no man could endure her. By the end of the song, pride had her sitting straighter.\nI finished the song. \u201cWould you like to hear another?\u201d I asked.\nShe nodded and grinned eagerly. She sat among the cushions, back straight, as regal as a queen.\nI moved into a second song, similar to the first. It was called \u201cLady Fae\u201d or something of the sort. I didn\u2019t know who had written it, but they had an appalling habit of sticking extra syllables into their lines. It wasn\u2019t bad enough to get anything thrown at me in a tavern, but it was close.\nI watched Felurian closely as I played. She was flattered, but I could read a slight dissatisfaction growing. As if she was irritated, but she couldn\u2019t decide why. Perfect.\nLast I played a song written for Queen Serule. I guarantee you haven\u2019t heard it, but I\u2019m sure you know the type. Written by some toadying minstrel looking for a patronage, my father had taught it to me as an example of certain things to avoid when writing a song. It was a numbing example of mediocrity. You could tell the writer was either truly inept, had never met Serule, or that he simply didn\u2019t find her attractive at all.\nWhile singing it, I simply exchanged the name Felurian for Serule. I also replaced some of the better phrases with less poetic ones. By the time I was through with it, the song was truly wretched, and Felurian wore an expression", "of naked dismay upon her face.\nI sat for a long moment, as if deeply considering something. When I finally\ndid speak, my voice was hushed and hesitant. \u201cLady, might I write a song for you?\u201d I gave her a sheepish smile.\nHer smile was like the moon through the clouds. She clapped her hands and threw herself onto me with a kittenish delight, peppering me with kisses. Only fear that my lute might be broken kept me from properly enjoying the experience.\nFelurian pulled away and sat very still. I tried a couple of chord combinations, then stilled my hands and looked up at her. \u201cI will call it \u2018The Lay of Felurian.\u2019 \u201d She blushed a bit and looked at me through lowered eyes, her expression bashful and brazen.\nAll immodest boasting aside, I write a fine song when I set my hand to it, and my skills had recently been sharpened in the Maer\u2019s employ. I am not the best, but I am one of the best. Given enough time, a worthy subject, and the proper motivation I daresay I could write a song nearly as well as Illien. Nearly.\nClosing my eyes, I coaxed sweet strains from my lute. My fingers flew, and I captured the music of wind in the branches, of rustling leaves.\nThen I looked to the back of my mind where the mad, chattering part of me had been composing a song to Felurian all this while. I brushed the strings more lightly and began to sing.\nFlashing moon silver, midnight blue her eyes The lids were subtle-colored butterflies.\nHer hair swayed, a dark scythe swinging Through the trees with the wind singing. Felurian! O Lady Fair,\nBlessed be your forest glade.\nYour breath is light upon the air. Your hair is shadow-dappled shade.\nFelurian grew still as I sang. Toward the end of the chorus I could hardly tell if she was breathing. A few of the butterflies that had been frightened away by our earlier conflict came dancing back to us. One of them landed on Felurian\u2019s hand, brushing its wings once, twice, as if curious why its mistress was so sudden still. I turned my eyes to my lute again and chose notes like", "raindrops licking the leaves of trees.\nShe danced in dancing shadows candle cast She held my eyes, my face, my form, full fast. Her smile a snare ten times as strong\nAs legendary faerie song.\nO Lady Fair! Felurian,\nYour kiss is honeysuckle sweet.\nI pity any other man\nUnknown to you and incomplete.\nI watched her from the corner of my eye. She sat as if listening with her entire body. Her eyes were wide. She\u2019d raised one hand to her mouth, upsetting the butterfly resting there, while the other pressed against her chest as she drew a slow breath. This is what I had wanted, but I regretted it nonetheless.\nI bent over my lute and danced my fingers across the strings. I wove chords like water over river stones, like a soft breath against the ear. Then I steeled myself and sang:\nHer eyes were of the bluest black\nLike night sky with the clouds blown back Her skills in love\u2014\nI stuttered my fingers on the strings, pausing for just a moment as if unsure of something. I saw Felurian wake halfway from her reverie and continued:\nHer skills in love they do suffice\nIn close embrace men find her nice. Felurian! O Mistress Bright,\nYour touch more sought than silver I br\u2014\n\u201cwhat?\u201d Even though I was expecting the interruption, the ice in her voice startled me into a jangle of notes and sent several butterflies into flight. I took a breath, assumed my most innocent expression, and looked up.\nHer expression was a storm of rage and disbelief. \u201cnice?\u201d I felt the blood drain from my face at her tone. Her voice was still round and gentle as a", "distant flute. But that meant nothing. Distant thunder doesn\u2019t drub the ears, you feel it prowling through your chest. The quiet of her voice moved through me in that distant-thunder way. \u201cnice?\u201d\n\u201cIt was nice,\u201d I said to mollify her, my air of innocence only half affected.\nShe opened her mouth as if she would speak, then closed her mouth. Her eyes flashed pure fury.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cI should have known better than to try.\u201d I pitched my voice somewhere between broken spirit and beaten child. I lowered my hands from the lute strings.\nSome of the fire left her, but when she found her voice it was tight and dangerous. \u201cmy skills \u2018suffice\u2019?\u201d She hardly seemed able to force out the last word. Her mouth formed a thin, outraged line.\nI exploded, my voice a roll of thunder. \u201cHow the hell am I supposed to know? It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve ever done this sort of thing before!\u201d\nShe reeled back at the vehemence of my words, some of the anger draining out of her. \u201cwhat is it you mean?\u201d she trailed off, confused.\n\u201cThis!\u201d I gestured awkwardly at myself, at her, at the cushions and the pavilion around us, as if that explained everything.\nThe last of the anger left her as I saw realization begin to dawn, \u201cyou ...\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I looked down, my face growing hot. \u201cI have never been with a woman.\u201d Then I straightened and looked her in the eye as if challenging her to make an issue out of it.\nFelurian was still for a moment, then her mouth turned up into a wry smile. \u201cyou tell me a faerie story, my kvothe.\u201d\nI felt my face go grim. I don\u2019t mind being called a liar. I am. I am a marvelous liar. But I hate being called a liar when I\u2019m telling the perfect truth.\nRegardless of its motivation, my expression seemed to convince her. \u201cbut you were like a gentle summer storm.\u201d She made a fluttering gesture with a hand. \u201cyou were a dancer fresh upon the field.\u201d Her eyes glittered wickedly.\nI tucked that comment away for later ego-polishing purposes. My reply was slightly wounded, \u201cPlease, I\u2019m not a complete rube. I\u2019ve read several books\u2014\u201d\nFelurian giggled like a brook. \u201cyou learned from books.\u201d She looked at me as if she couldn\u2019t decide whether or not to take me seriously. She laughed, stopped, then laughed again. I didn\u2019t know if I should be offended.\n\u201cYou were rather good too,\u201d I said hurriedly, knowing I sounded like the", "last dinner guest to compliment her on a salad. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I\u2019ve read \u2014\u201d\n\u201cbooks? books! you compare me with books!\u201d Her anger crashed over me. Then without even pausing for breath, Felurian laughed again, high and delighted. Her laugh was wild as a fox\u2019s cry, clear and sharp as morning birdsong. It was no human sound.\nI put on my innocent face. \u201cIsn\u2019t it always like this?\u201d I kept my expression calm while inwardly I braced myself for another outburst.\nShe simply sat. \u201cI am Felurian.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t a simple stating of a name. It was a declaration. It was a proud flag flying.\nI held her eyes for a moment, then sighed and dropped my gaze to my lute. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the song. I didn\u2019t mean to offend you.\u201d\n\u201cit was more lovely than the setting sun,\u201d she protested, sounding close to tears. \u201cbut.... nice?\u201d The word seemed bitter to her.\nI set my lute back into its case. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t fix it without some basis for comparison....\u201d I sighed. \u201cPity, it was a good song. They would have sung it for a thousand years.\u201d My voice was thick with regret.\nFelurian\u2019s expression brightened as if with an idea, then her eyes narrowed into slits. She looked at me as if she was trying to read something written on the inside of my skull.\nShe knew. She knew I was holding the unfinished song as ransom. The unspoken messages were clear: Unless I leave I can never finish the song. Unless I leave no one will ever hear these beautiful words I have made for you. Unless I leave and taste the fruits mortal women have to offer, I\u2019ll never know how skilled you truly are.\nThere, amid the cushions, under the eternal twilight sky, Felurian and I stared at each other. She held a butterfly, and my hand rested on the smooth wood of my lute. Two armored knights eyeing each other across a bloody field could not have matched the intensity of our stare.\nFelurian spoke slowly, gauging my response. \u201cif you go, will you finish it?\u201d I tried to look surprised, but I wasn\u2019t fooling her. I nodded. \u201cwill you come back to me and sing it?\u201d\nMy surprise became genuine. I hadn\u2019t considered her asking for that. I knew there would be no leaving the second time. I hesitated, but only for a barest moment. Half a loaf is better than none. I nodded.\n\u201cpromise?\u201d I nodded again. \u201cpromise with kisses?\u201d She closed her eyes", "and tilted her head back, like a flower basking in the sun.\nLife is too short to refuse offers like that. I moved toward her, drew her naked body toward my own, and kissed her as well as my limited practice\nwould allow. It seemed to be good enough.\nAs I pulled away she looked up at me and sighed. \u201cyour kisses are like\nsnowflakes on my lips.\u201d She lay back on the cushions, head resting on her arm. Her free hand brushed my cheek.\nTo say she was lovely is such an understatement I cannot begin to repair it. I realized that over the last several minutes she hadn\u2019t been trying to make me desire her, at least not in any supernatural sense.\nShe brushed her lips lightly over the palm of my hand and released it. Then she lay still, watching me intently.\nI was flattered. To this day I know of only one answer to a question so politely phrased. I bent to kiss her. And laughing, she took me in her arms.", "CHAPTER NINETY-NINE\nMagic of a Different Kind\nBY THIS POINT IN my life, I\u2019d earned myself a modest reputation. No, that\u2019s not entirely true. It\u2019s better to say that I had built myself a\nreputation. I\u2019d crafted it deliberately. I\u2019d cultivated it.\nThree-quarters of the stories folk told about me at the University were\nridiculous rumors I\u2019d started myself. I spoke eight languages. I could see in the dark. When I was three days old, my mother hung me in a basket from a rowan tree by the light of the full moon. That night a faerie laid a powerful charm on me to always keep me safe. It turned my eyes from blue to leafy green.\nI knew how stories worked, you see. Nobody believed that I\u2019d traded a cupped handful of my own fresh blood to a demon in exchange for an Alar like a blade of Ramston steel. But still, I was the highest ranked duelist in Dal\u2019s class. On a good day, I could beat any two of them together.\nThat thread of truth wove through the story, gave it strength. So even though you might not believe it, you might tell it to a wide-eyed first term student with a drink in him, just to watch his face, just for fun. And if you\u2019d had a drink or three yourself, you might begin to wonder....\nAnd so the stories spread. And so, around the University at least, my tiny reputation grew.\nThere were a few true stories as well. Pieces of my reputation I\u2019d honestly earned. I had rescued Fela from a blazing inferno. I had been whipped in front of a crowd and refused to bleed. I\u2019d called the wind and broken Ambrose\u2019s arm....\nStill, I knew my reputation was a coat spun out of cobweb. It was storybook nonsense. There were no demons out there, bargaining for blood. There were no helpful faeries granting magic charms. And though I might pretend, I knew I was no Taborlin the Great.\nThese were my thoughts when I woke, tangled in Felurian\u2019s arms. I lay quietly among the cushions for a time, her head resting lightly on my chest,", "her leg thrown loosely over mine. Looking up through the trees at the twilight sky, I realized I could not recognize the stars. They were brighter than those in the mortal sky, their patterns unfamiliar.\nIt was only then that I realized my life had taken a step in a new direction. Up until now, I had been playing at being a young Taborlin. I had spun lies around myself, pretending to be a storybook hero.\nBut now there was no sense pretending. What I\u2019d done was truly worth a story, every bit as odd and wonderful as any tale of Taborlin himself. I\u2019d followed Felurian into the Fae, then bested her with magics I couldn\u2019t explain, let alone control.\nI felt different now. More solid somehow. Not older, exactly. Not wiser. But I knew things that I\u2019d never known before. I knew the Fae were real. I knew their magic was real. Felurian could break a man\u2019s mind with a kiss. Her voice could tug me like a puppet by its strings. There were things I could learn here. Strange things. Powerful things. Secret things. Things I might never ever have a chance to learn again.\nI gently freed myself from Felurian\u2019s sleeping embrace and walked down to the nearby pool. I splashed water on my face and scooped up several handfuls to drink.\nI looked through the plants that grew at the water\u2019s edge. I picked some leaves and chewed them as I considered how I might approach the subject with Felurian. The mint sweetened my breath.\nWhen I returned to the pavilion, Felurian was standing there, brushing pale fingers through her long dark hair.\nI handed her a violet, its color dark as her eyes. She smiled at me and ate it.\nI decided to approach the subject gently, lest I offend her. \u201cI was wondering,\u201d I said carefully, \u201cif you would be willing to teach me.\u201d\nShe reached out to touch the side of my face gently. \u201cfoolish sweet,\u201d she said fondly. \u201chave not I already begun?\u201d\nI felt excitement rise in my chest, amazed that it could be so simple. \u201cAm I ready for my next lesson?\u201d I asked.\nHer smile grew wider and she looked me up and down, her eyes going half-lidded and mysterious. \u201care you?\u201d\nI nodded.\n\u201cit is good you are eager,\u201d Felurian said, her fluting voice tinged with amusement. \u201cyou have some cleverness and natural skill. but there is much to learn.\u201d She looked into my eyes, her delicate face gravely serious. \u201cwhen you", "leave to walk among the mortal, I will not have you shame me.\u201d\nFelurian took my hand and drew me into the pavilion. She pointed. \u201csit.\u201d I sat on a cushion, placing my head level with the smooth expanse of her\nstomach. Her navel was terribly distracting.\nShe looked down at me, her expression proud and regal as a queen.\n\u201camouen,\u201d she said, spreading the fingers of one hand and making a deliberate gesture. \u201cthis we call the hushed hart. an easy lesson to begin, and one I expect you will enjoy.\u201d\nFelurian smiled at me then, her eyes old and knowing. And even before she pushed me back against the cushions and began to bite the side of my neck, I realized that she did not intend to teach me magic. Or if she did, it was magic of a different kind.\nWhile it was not the subject I\u2019d hoped to study under her, it\u2019s fair to say that I was not entirely disappointed. Learning lover\u2019s arts from Felurian far outstripped any curriculum offered at the University.\nI am not referring to the vigorous sweaty wrestling most men\u2014and alas, most women\u2014think of as love. While sweat and vigor are pleasant parts of it, Felurian brought to my attention the subtler pieces. If I were to go into the world, she said, I would not embarrass her by being an incompetent lover, and so she took care to show me a great many things.\nA few of them in her words: The pinioned wrist. The sigh toward the ear. Devouring the neck. Drawing the lips. The kissing of the throat, the navel, and\u2014as Felurian phrased it\u2014the woman\u2019s flower. The breathing kiss. The feather kiss. The climbing kiss. So many different types of kissing. Too many to remember. Almost.\nThere was drawing water from the well. The fluttering hand. Birdsong at morning. Circling the moon. Playing ivy. The harrowed hare. Just the names would fill a book. But this, I suppose, is not the place for such things. Alas then for the world.\nI don\u2019t mean to give the impression that all our hours were spent in dalliance. I was young and Felurian was immortal, but there is only so much two bodies can endure. The rest of the time we amused ourselves in other ways. We swam and ate. I played songs for Felurian, and she danced for me.\n \nI asked Felurian a few careful questions about magic, not wanting to offend her by prying at her secrets. Unfortunately, her answers were not particularly enlightening. Her magic came as naturally as breathing. I might as well have asked a farmer how seeds sprouted. When her answers weren\u2019t hopelessly nonchalant, they were puzzlingly cryptic.\nStill, I continued to ask, and she answered as best she could. And occasionally I felt a small spark of understanding.\nBut most of our time was spent telling stories. We had so little in common that stories were all that we could share.\nYou might think Felurian and I would be unevenly matched in this regard. She was older than the sky, while I was not yet seventeen.\nBut Felurian was not the narrative treasure trove you would think. Powerful and clever? Certainly. Energetic and lovely? Absolutely. But storytelling was not among her many gifts.\nI, on the other hand, was of the Edema Ruh, and we know all the stories in the world.\nSo I told her \u201cThe Ghost and the Goosegirl.\u201d I told her \u201cTam and the Tinker\u2019s Spade.\u201d I told her stories of woodcutters and widow\u2019s daughters and the cleverness of orphan boys.\nIn exchange, Felurian told me manling stories: \u201cThe Hand at the Heart of the Pearl,\u201d \u201cThe Boy Who Ran Between.\u201d The Fae have their own cast of legendary characters: Mavin the Manshaped, Alavin Allface. Surprisingly, Felurian had never heard of Taborlin the Great or Oren Velciter, but she did know who Illien was. It made me proud that one of the Edema Ruh had gained a place in the stories the Fae tell each other.\nI wasn\u2019t blind to the fact that Felurian herself might have the information I was looking for about the Amyr and the Chandrian. How much more enjoyable would it be to learn the truth from her, rather than rooting endlessly through ancient books in dusty rooms?\nUnfortunately, Felurian wasn\u2019t the mine of information I\u2019d hoped. She knew stories of the Amyr, but they were thousands of years old.\nWhen I asked her about the more recent Amyr, asking about church knights and the Ciridae with their bloody tattoos, she merely laughed. \u201cthere were never any human amyr,\u201d she said, dismissing the idea out of hand. \u201cthose you speak of sound like children dressing in their parents\u2019 clothes.\u201d\nWhile I might expect that reaction from others, getting it from Felurian was particularly disheartening. Still, it was nice to know I had been right", "about the Amyr existing long before they became knights of the Tehlin church.\nThen, since the Amyr were a lost cause, I tried to steer her in the direction of the Chandrian.\n\u201cno,\u201d she said, looking me squarely in the eye, her back straight. \u201cI will not speak of the seven.\u201d Her soft voice held no lilting whimsy. No playfulness. No room for discussion or negotiation.\nFor the first time since our initial conflict, I felt a trickle of icy fear sweep over me. She was so slight and lovely, it was so easy to forget what she truly was.\nStill, I couldn\u2019t let the subject go so easily. This was, quite literally, a once in a lifetime opportunity. If Felurian could be persuaded to tell me even a piece of what she knew, I could learn things no one else in the world might know.\nI gave her my most charming smile and drew a breath to speak, but before I could get the first word out, Felurian leaned forward and kissed me full upon the mouth. Her lips were plush and warm. Her tongue brushed mine and she bit the swell of my lower lip playfully.\nWhen she pulled her mouth from mine, it left me breathless with a racing heart. She looked at me, her dark eyes full of tender sweetness. She laid her hand along my face, brushing my cheek as gently as a flower.\n\u201cmy sweet love,\u201d she said. \u201cif you ask of the seven again in this place, I will drive you from it. no matter if your asking be firm or gentle, honest or slantways. if you ask, I will whip you forth from here with a lash of brambles and snakes. I will drive you before me, bloody and weeping, and will not stop until you are dead or fled from fae.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t look away from me as she spoke. And though I hadn\u2019t looked away or seen them change, her eyes were no longer soft with adoration. They were dark as storm clouds, hard as ice.\n\u201cI do not jest,\u201d she said. \u201cI swear this by my flower and the ever-moving moon. I swear it by salt and stone and sky. I swear this singing and laughing, by the sound of my own name.\u201d She kissed me again, pressing her lips to mine tenderly. \u201cI will do this thing.\u201d\nAnd that was the end of it. I might be a fool, but I am not that much of a fool.\n \nFelurian was more than willing to talk about the Fae realm itself. And many of her stories detailed the fractious politics of the faen courts: the Tain Mael, the Daendan, the Gorse Court. These stories were difficult for me to follow as I didn\u2019t know anything about the factions involved, let alone the web of alliances, false friendships, open secrets, and old grudges that bound Fae society together.\nThis was complicated by the fact that Felurian took it for granted that I understood certain things. If I were telling you a story, for example, I wouldn\u2019t bother mentioning that most moneylenders are Cealdish, or that there is no royalty older than the Modegan royal line. Who doesn\u2019t know such things?\nFelurian left similar details out of her stories. Who wouldn\u2019t know, for example, that the Gorse Court had meddled in the Berentaltha between the Mael and the House of Fine?\nAnd why was this important? Well of course that would lead to members of the Gorse being scorned by those on the dayward side of things. And what was the Berentaltha? A sort of dance. And why was this dance important?\nAfter a handful of questions such as this, Felurian\u2019s eyes would narrow. I quickly learned it was better to follow along, quiet and confused, rather than try to winkle out every detail and risk her irritation.\nStill, I learned things from these stories: a thousand small, scattered facts about the Fae. The names of the courts, old battles, and notable persons. I learned you must never look at one of the Thiana with both eyes at once, and that the gift of a single cinnas fruit is considered a terrible insult if given to one of the Beladari.\nYou might think these thousand facts gave me some insight into the Fae. That I somehow fit them together like puzzle pieces and discovered the true shape of things. A thousand facts is quite a lot, after all....\nBut no. A thousand seems like a lot, but there are more stars than that in the sky, and they make neither a map nor a mural. All I knew for certain after hearing Felurian\u2019s stories is that I had no desire to ever entangle myself in even the kindest corner of the faen court. With my luck I\u2019d whistle while walking under a willow and thereby insult God\u2019s barber, or something of the sort.\nHere is the one thing I learned from these stories: the Fae are not like us.", "This is endlessly easy to forget, because many of them look as we do. They speak our language. They have two eyes. They have hands, and their mouths make familiar shapes when they smile. But these things are only seemings. We are not the same.\nI have heard people say that men and the Fae are as different as dogs and wolves. While this is an easy analogy, it is far from true. Wolves and dogs are only separated by a minor shade of blood. Both howl at night. If beaten, both will bite.\nNo. Our people and theirs are as different as water and alcohol. In equal glasses they look the same. Both liquid. Both clear. Both wet, after a fashion. But one will burn, the other will not. This has nothing to do with temperament or timing. These two things behave differently because they are profoundly, fundamentally not the same.\nThe same is true with humans and the Fae. We forget it at our peril.", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED\nShaed\nI SHOULD, PERHAPS, EXPLAIN a few peculiarities of the Fae.\nAt first glance, Felurian\u2019s forest glade did not seem particularly odd. In\nmost ways it resembled an ancient, untouched piece of forest. If not for the unfamiliar stars above, I might have suspected I was still in an isolated piece of the Eld.\nBut there were differences. Since I had left my mercenary companions I had slept perhaps a dozen times. Despite this, the sky above Felurian\u2019s pavilion remained the deep purpling blue of summer dusk and showed no signs of changing.\nI had only the roughest guess as to how long I had been in the Fae. More importantly, I had no idea how much time might have been passing in the mortal world. Stories are full of boys who fall asleep in faerie circles only to wake as old men. Young girls wander into the woods and return years later, looking no older and claiming only minutes have passed.\nFor all I knew, years could pass each time I slept in Felurian\u2019s arms. I could return to find a century had passed, or no time at all.\nI did my best not to think about it. Only a fool worries over what he can\u2019t control.\nThe other difference in the Fae realm was much more subtle and difficult to describe....\nIn the Medica, I had spent a fair amount of time around unconscious patients. I mention this to make a point: there is a great difference between being in a room that is empty and being in a room where someone is sleeping. A sleeping person is a presence in a room. They are aware of you, even if it is only a dim, vague awareness.\nThat is what the Fae was like. It was such an odd, intangible thing that I didn\u2019t notice it for a long while. Then, once I became aware of it, it took me much longer to lay my finger on what the difference was.\nIt felt as if I had moved from an empty room into a room where someone", "was asleep. Except, of course, that there was no one there. It was as if everything around me was deeply asleep: the trees, the stones, the rippling stream that widened into Felurian\u2019s pool. All these things felt more solid, more present than I was used to, as if they were ever so slightly aware of me.\nThe thought that I would eventually leave the Fae alive and unbroken was an unfamiliar one for Felurian, and I could tell it troubled her. Often, while in the midst of an unrelated conversation, she would change direction and make me promise, promise, to return to her.\nI reassured her as best I could, but there are only so many ways you can say the same thing. After perhaps three dozen times I said, \u201cI will do my best to keep myself safe so I can come back to you.\u201d\nI saw her face change, becoming first anxious, then grim, then thoughtful. For a moment I worried she had decided to keep me as a pet mortal after all, and I began to berate myself for not fleeing the Fae when I had the chance....\nBut before I could begin to grow genuinely concerned, Felurian cocked her head to one side and seemed to change the subject, \u201cwould my sweet flame like a coat? a cloak?\u201d\n\u201cI have one,\u201d I said, gesturing to where my possessions lay scattered at the edge of the pavilion. Only then did I notice that the tatty old tinker\u2019s cloak wasn\u2019t there. I saw my clothes, my boots, and my travelsack still bulging with the Maer\u2019s lockbox. But my cloak and sword were gone. The fact that I hadn\u2019t noticed their absence was understandable, as I hadn\u2019t bothered dressing since I first woke next to Felurian.\nShe looked me over slowly, her expression intent. Her eyes lingering on my knee, my lower arm, my upper arm. It was only when she took hold of my shoulder, and turned me so she could examine my back, that I realized she was looking at my scars.\nFelurian took hold of my hand and traced a pale line that ran along my forearm. \u201cyou are not good at keeping yourself safe, my kvothe.\u201d\nI was a little offended, especially as there was more than a little truth to what she said. \u201cI do fairly well,\u201d I said stiffly. \u201cConsidering the trouble that I find.\u201d\nFelurian turned over my hand and examined my palm and fingers closely.\n \n\u201cyou are not a fighter,\u201d she mused softly to herself. \u201cyet you are all iron- bitten. you are a sweet bird that cannot fly. no bow. no knife. no chain.\u201d\nHer hand moved to my foot, running thoughtfully along the calluses and scars from my years on the streets of Tarbean. \u201cyou are a long walker. you find me in the wild at night. you are a deep knower. and bold. and young. and trouble finds you.\u201d\nShe looked up at me, her face intent. \u201cwould my sweet poet like a shaed?\u201d \u201cA what?\u201d\nShe paused as if considering her words. \u201ca shadow.\u201d\nI smiled. \u201cI already have one.\u201d Then I checked to make sure. I was in the\nFae after all.\nFelurian frowned, shaking her head at my lack of understanding. \u201canother I\nwould give a shield, and it would keep him safe from harm. another I would gift with amber, bind a scabbard tight with glamour, or craft a crown so men might look on you with love.\u201d\nShe shook her head solemnly. \u201cbut not for you. you are a night walker. a moon follower. you must be safe from iron, from cold, from spite. you must be quiet. you must be light. you must move softly in the night. you must be quick and unafraid.\u201d She nodded to herself. \u201cthis means I must make you a shaed.\u201d\nShe stood and started walking toward the forest. \u201ccome,\u201d she said.\nFelurian had a way of making requests that took some getting used to. I\u2019d discovered that unless I was steeling myself to resist, I\u2019d find myself automatically doing whatever it was she asked of me.\nIt wasn\u2019t that she spoke with authority. Her voice was too soft and edgeless to carry the weight of command. She did not demand or cajole. When she spoke, it was matter-of-fact. As if she couldn\u2019t imagine a world in which you didn\u2019t want to do exactly as she said.\nBecause of this, when Felurian told me to follow her, I jumped like a puppet with its strings pulled. Soon I was padding along beside her, deep in the twilight shadows of the ancient forest, naked as a jaybird.\nI almost went back to grab my clothes, then decided to follow some advice my father had given me when I was young. \u201cEveryone eats a different part of the pig,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cYou want to fit in, you\u2019ll do the same.\u201d Different places, different decorums.\nSo I followed, naked and unprepared. Felurian struck out at a good pace, the moss muffling the sound of our bare feet.", "As we walked the forest grew darker. At first I thought it was simply the branches of the trees arching over our heads. Then I realized the truth. Above us, the twilight sky was slowly growing darker. Eventually, the last hint of purple was gone, leaving the sky a perfect velvet black, flecked with unfamiliar stars.\nFelurian kept walking, I could see her pale skin in the starlight and the shapes of trees around us, but nothing more. Thinking myself clever, I made a sympathetic binding for light and held my hand above my head as if it were a torch. I was more than slightly proud of this, as the motion-to-light binding is rather difficult without a piece of metal to use as a focus.\nLight swelled and I caught a moment\u2019s glimpse of our surroundings. Dark trunks of trees rose like massive pillars as far as the eye could see. There were no low-hanging branches, no undergrowth, no grass. Only dark moss underfoot and the arch of dark branches overhead. I was reminded of a vast, empty cathedral swathed in sooty velvet.\n\u201cciar nalias!\u201d Felurian snapped.\nUnderstanding her tone if not her words, I broke the binding and let the darkness rush back over us. An instant later Felurian leapt at me and bore me to the ground, her lithe, naked body pressed against mine. It was not an entirely uncommon occurrence, but this time the experience was not particularly erotic as the back of my head struck a knuckle of protruding root.\nBecause of this I was half dazed and nine-tenths blind when the earth shuddered slightly beneath us. Something vast and almost perfectly silent stirred the air above us and slightly off to one side of where we lay.\nPoised atop me, one leg on either side, Felurian\u2019s body was as taut as a harp string. The muscles of her thighs were tense and quivering. Her long hair fell over us, covering us like a silk sheet. Her breasts pressed against my chest as she drew a shallow, silent breath.\nHer body thrummed with the rhythm of her racing heart, and I felt her mouth move where it rested near the hollow of my throat. Softer than a whisper, Felurian spoke a gentle, edgeless word. I felt it press against my skin, sending silent ripples through the air the same way a thrown stone makes circles on the surface of a pond.\nThere was a soft sound of movement above us, as if someone was folding a huge piece of velvet around a piece of broken glass. Saying that I realize it makes no sense, but still, that is the best way I can describe the sound. It was a soft noise, the half-heard sound of deliberate movement. I cannot tell you", "why it made me think of something terrible and sharp, but it did. My forehead prickled with sweat, and I was filled with a sudden pure and breathless terror.\nFelurian went perfectly still, as if she were a startled deer or a cat about to pounce. Quietly, she drew a breath, then spoke a second word. Her breath brushed hot against my throat, and at the half-heard word my body thrummed as if I were a drumhead soundly struck.\nFelurian turned her head a bare degree, as if straining to listen. This movement pulled a thousand strands of her splayed hair slowly over the entire left half of my naked body, covering me in gooseflesh. Even in the grip of my nameless terror, I shivered and gave a soft, involuntary gasp.\nThere was a stirring in the air directly above us.\nThe sharp nails of Felurian\u2019s left hand dug hard into the muscle of my shoulder. She shifted her hips, and slowly slid her naked body up along my own until her face was even with mine. Her tongue flicked against my lips, and without even thinking I tilted my head, reaching for the kiss.\nHer mouth met mine, and she drew a long slow breath, pulling the air out of me. I felt my head grow light. Then, her lips still tight against mine, Felurian pushed her breath hard into me, filling my lungs. It was softer than silent. It tasted of honeysuckle. The ground shivered beneath me and everything was still. For an endless moment my heart ceased beating in my chest.\nA subtle tension left the air above us.\nFelurian pulled her mouth from mine and my heart thumped again, sudden and hard. A second beat. A third. I pulled in a deep, shaking breath.\nOnly then did Felurian relax. She lay atop me, loose and supple, her naked body flowing over mine like water. Her head nestled into the curve of my neck and she gave a sweet, contented sigh.\nA languid moment passed, then she laughed, her body shaking with it. It was wild and delighted, as if she had just played the most marvelous joke. She sat up and kissed my mouth fiercely, then nipped at my ear before climbing off me and pulling me to my feet.\nI opened my mouth. Then closed it, deciding this was probably not the right time for questions. Half of seeming clever is keeping your mouth shut at the right times.\nSo we continued in darkness. Eventually my eyes adjusted, and through the branches above I could see the stars, differently patterned and brighter than", "those in the mortal sky. Their light was barely enough to give an impression of the ground and surrounding trees. Felurian\u2019s slender form was a silver shadow in the darkness.\nWe kept walking, and the trees grew taller and thicker, blocking out the pale starlight bit by bit. Then it became truly dark. Felurian was little more than a piece of pale darkness ahead of me. She stopped walking before I lost sight of her entirely and cupped her hands around her mouth as if she were about to shout.\nI cringed at the thought of a loud noise invading the warm quiet of this place. But instead of a shout there was nothing. No. Not nothing. It was like a low, slow purr. Not anything so loud and rough as a cat\u2019s purr. It was closer to the sound a heavy snowfall makes, a muffled hush that almost makes less noise than no noise at all.\nFelurian did this several times. Then she took me by the hand and led me farther into the dark where she repeated the odd, almost inaudible noise. After she had done this three times it was so dark I could no longer see even the faintest shape of her.\nAfter the final pause, Felurian stepped close to me in the dark, pressing her body to mine. She gave me a long and thorough kiss that I expected to become something more involved when she pulled away and spoke softly into my ear. \u201cquietly,\u201d she breathed. \u201cthey come.\u201d\nFor several minutes I strained my eyes and ears to no avail. Then I saw something luminous in the distance. It disappeared quickly, and I thought my light-starved eyes were playing tricks on me. Then I saw another flicker. Two more. Ten. A hundred pale lights danced toward us through the trees, faint as foxfire.\nI\u2019d heard of fool\u2019s fire before, but never seen it. And given that we were in the Fae, I doubted this was anything so mundane. I thought of a hundred faerie stories and wondered which of those creatures could be responsible for these dim, madly dancing lights. Tom-Sparks? Will o\u2019 wisps? Dennerlings with lanterns full of corpselight?\nThen they were all around us, startling me. The lights were smaller than I\u2019d thought, and closer. I heard the hushed snowfall sound again, this time from all around me. I still couldn\u2019t guess what they might be until one of them brushed my arm as lightly as a feather. They were moths of some sort. Moths with luminescent patches on their wings.\nThey shone with a pale, silvery light too weak to illuminate anything", "around them. But hundreds of them, dancing between the boles of trees, showed the silhouette of our surroundings. Some of them lit on trees or the ground. A few landed on Felurian, and though I still could not see more than a few inches of her pale skin, I could use the moving light of them to follow her.\nWe walked a long while after that, Felurian leading between the trunks of ancient trees. Once I felt grass soft beneath my bare feet instead of moss, then there was soft soil, as if we were crossing a farmer\u2019s fresh-tilled field. For a time we followed a twisting path of smooth paved stone that led us over the arch of a high bridge. All the while the moths followed us, giving me only the dimmest impression of our surroundings.\nEventually Felurian stopped. By now the darkness was so thick I could almost feel it like a warm blanket around me. I could tell by the sound of the wind in the trees and the motion of the moths that we were standing in an open space.\nThere were no stars above us. If we were in a clearing, the trees must be vast for their branches to meet overhead. But for all I knew we could just as easily be deep underground. Or perhaps the sky was black and empty in this portion of the Fae. It was a strangely unsettling thought.\nThe subtle feeling of sleeping alertness was stronger here. If the rest of the Fae felt like it was sleeping, this place felt like it had stirred half a moment ago and hovered on the verge of waking. It was disconcerting.\nFelurian gently pressed the flat of her hand against my chest, then a finger against my lips. I watched as she moved away from me, softly humming a little snatch of the song I had made for her. But even this piece of flattery couldn\u2019t distract me from the fact that I was in the center of the Fae realm, blind, stark naked, and without the slightest idea of what was going on.\nA handful of moths had landed on Felurian, resting on her wrist, hip, shoulder and thigh. Watching them gave me a vague impression of her movements. If I had to guess, I would have said she was picking things out of the trees, from behind or beneath bushes or stones. A warm breeze sighed through the clearing, and I felt strangely comforted as it brushed my bare skin.\nAfter about ten minutes, Felurian came back and kissed me. She held something soft and warm in her arms.\nWe walked back the way we had come. The moths gradually lost interest in us, leaving us with less and less of an impression of our surroundings.", "After what seemed an interminable amount of time I saw light filtering through a break in the trees ahead. It was only faint starlight, but at that moment it seemed bright as a curtain of burning diamonds.\nI started to walk through it, but Felurian took hold of my arm to stop me. Without a word she sat me down where the first faint beams of starlight lanced through the trees to touch the ground.\nCarefully she stepped between the rays of starlight, avoiding them as if they might burn her. When she stood in the center of them, she lowered herself to the ground and sat cross-legged, facing me. She held whatever she had collected in her lap, but other than the fact that it was shapeless and dark I could tell nothing about it.\nThen Felurian reached out a hand, took hold of one of the thin beams of starlight, and pulled it toward the dark shape in her lap.\nI might have been more surprised if Felurian\u2019s manner hadn\u2019t been so casual. In the dim light, I saw her hands make a familiar motion. A second later she reached out again, almost absentmindedly, and grasped another narrow strand of starlight between her thumb and forefinger.\nShe drew it in as easily as the first and manipulated it in the same way. Again the motion struck me as familiar, but it was nothing I could press my finger to.\nFelurian started to hum quietly to herself as she gathered in the next beam of starlight, brightening things an imperceptible amount. The shape in her lap looked like thick, dark cloth. Seeing this I realized what she reminded me of: my father sewing. Was she sewing by starlight?\nSewing with starlight. Realization came to me in a flood. Shaed meant shadow. She had somehow brought back an armful of shadow and was sewing it with starlight. Sewing me a cloak of shadow.\nSound absurd? It did to me. But regardless of my ignorant opinion, Felurian took hold of another strand of starlight and brought it to her lap. I brushed any doubt aside. Only a fool disbelieves what he sees with his own eyes.\nBesides, the stars above me were bright and strange. I was sitting next to a creature out of a storybook. She had been young and beautiful for a thousand years. She could stop my heart with a kiss and talk to butterflies. Was I going to start quibbling now?\nAfter a while I moved closer so I could watch more carefully. She smiled as I sat next to her, favoring me with a hasty kiss.", "I asked a couple questions, but her answers either made no sense or were hopelessly nonchalant. She didn\u2019t know the first thing about the laws of sympathy, or sygaldry, or the Alar. She simply didn\u2019t think there was anything odd about sitting in the forest holding a handful of shadow. First I was offended, then I was terribly jealous.\nI remembered when I\u2019d found the name of the wind in her pavilion. It had felt as if I were truly awake for the first time, true knowledge running like ice in my blood.\nThe memory exhilarated me for a moment, then left me with a broken chord of loss. My sleeping mind was slumbering again. I turned my attention back to Felurian and tried to understand.\nBefore too long, Felurian stood in a fluid motion and helped me to my feet. She hummed happily and took my arm as we strolled back the way we had come, chatting of little things. She held the dark shape of the shaed draped easily over her arm.\nThen, just as the first faint hint of twilight began to touch the sky, she hung it invisibly in the dark branches of a nearby tree. \u201csometimes slow seduction is the only way,\u201d she said. \u201cthe gentle shadow fears the candleflame. how could your fledgling shaed not feel the same?\u201d", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED ONE\nClose Enough to Touch\nAFTER OUR SHADOW-GATHERING EXPEDITION, I asked more pointed questions about Felurian\u2019s magic. Most of her answers continued to be hopelessly matter-of-fact. How do you take hold of a shadow? She motioned with one hand, as if reaching for a piece of fruit. That was how, apparently.\nOther answers were nearly incomprehensible, filled with Fae words I didn\u2019t understand. When she tried to describe those terms, our conversations became hopeless rhetorical tangles. At times I felt like I\u2019d found myself a quieter, more attractive version of Elodin.\nStill, I learned a few scraps. What she was doing with the shadow was called grammarie. When I asked, she said it was \u201cthe art of making things be.\u201d This was distinct from glamourie, which was \u201cthe art of making things seem.\u201d\nI also learned that there aren\u2019t directions of the usual sort in the Fae. Your trifoil compass is useless as a tin codpiece there. North does not exist. And when the sky is endless twilight, you cannot watch the sun rise in the east.\nBut if you look closely at the sky, one piece of the horizon will be a shade brighter, in the opposite direction a shade darker. If you walk toward the brighter horizon, eventually it will become daytime. The other way leads to darker night. If you keep walking in one direction long enough, you will eventually see a whole \u201cday\u201d pass and end up in the same place you began. That\u2019s the theory, at any rate.\nFelurian described those two points of the Fae compass as Day and Night. The other two points she referred to at different times as Dark and Light, Summer and Winter, or Forward and Backward. Once she even referred to them as Grimward and Grinning, but something about the way she said it made me suspect it was a joke.\n \nI have a good memory. That, perhaps more than anything else, sits in the center of what I am. It is the talent upon which so many of my other skills depend.\nI can only guess how I came by my memory. My early stage training, perhaps. The games my parents used to help me remember my lines. Perhaps it was the mental exercises Abenthy taught me to prepare me for the University.\nWherever it came from, my memory has always served me well. Sometimes it works much better than I\u2019d like.\nThat said, my memory is strangely patchy when I think of my time in the Fae. My conversations with Felurian are clear as glass. Her lessons may as well be written on my skin. The sight of her. The taste of her mouth. They are all fresh as yesterday.\nBut other things I cannot bring to mind at all.\nFor example, I remember Felurian in the purpling twilight. It dappled her through the trees, making her look as if she were underwater. I remember her in flickering candlelight, the teasing shadows of it concealing more than it revealed. And I remember her in the full, rich amber of lamplight. She basked in it like a cat, her skin warm and glowing.\nBut I do not remember lamps. Or candles. There is a great deal of fuss when dealing with such things, but I cannot remember a single moment spent trimming a wick or wiping soot from the glass hood of a lamp. I do not remember the smell of oil or smoke or wax.\nI remember eating. Fruit and bread and honey. Felurian ate flowers. Fresh orchids. Wild trillium. Lush selas. I tried some myself. The violets were my favorite.\nI don\u2019t mean to imply she ate only flowers. She enjoyed bread and butter and honey. She liked blackberries especially. And there was meat, too. Not with every meal, but sometimes. Wild venison. Pheasant. Bear. Felurian ate hers so rare that it was almost raw.\nShe was not a fastidious eater, either. Not prim or courtly. We ate with our hands and teeth, and afterward, if we were sticky with honey or pulp or the blood of bears, we would wash ourselves in the nearby pool.\nI can see her even now, naked, laughing, blood running down her chin. She was regal as a queen. Eager as a child. Proud as a cat. And she was like none", "of those things. Nothing like them. Not in the least little bit.\nMy point is this: I can remember our eating. What I cannot remember is\nwhere the food came from. Did someone bring it? Did she gather it herself? I cannot bring it to mind to save my life. The thought of servants intruding on the privacy of her twilight glade seems impossible to me, but so is the thought of Felurian baking her own bread.\nThe deer, on the other hand, I could understand. I had not the least doubt she could run one to ground and kill it with her hands if she desired. Or I could picture a shy hart venturing into the quiet of her twilight glade. I can imagine Felurian sitting, patient and calm, waiting until it came close enough to touch....", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWO\nThe Ever-Moving Moon\nFELURIAN AND I WERE walking down to the pool when I noticed a subtle difference in the quality of light. Looking up, I was surprised to see the pale curve of the moon peering through the trees above us.\nEven though it was only the slenderest crescent, I recognized it as the same moon I had known my whole life. Seeing it in this strange place was like meeting a long-lost friend far from home.\n\u201cLook!\u201d I said, pointing. \u201cThe moon!\u201d\nFelurian smiled indulgently. \u201cyou are my precious newborn lamb. look! there hangs a cloud as well! amouen! dance for joy!\u201d She laughed.\nI flushed, embarrassed. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I haven\u2019t seen it in ...\u201d I trailed off, having no way to gauge my time. \u201cA long while. Besides, you have different stars. I thought perhaps you had a different moon as well.\u201d\nFelurian ran her fingers gently through my hair. \u201cfoolish sweet, there is only one moon. we have been waiting on her. she will help us enbighten your shaed.\u201d She slipped into the water, sleek as an otter. When she surfaced her hair slicked her shoulders like ink.\nI sat on a stone by the edge of a pool and dangled my feet. The water was warm as a bath. \u201cHow can the moon be here,\u201d I asked, \u201cif this is a different sky?\u201d\n\u201cthere is only one slender slip of her here,\u201d Felurian said. \u201cshe is still mostly in the mortal now.\u201d\n\u201cBut how?\u201d I asked.\nFelurian stopped swimming and floated on her back, looking up at the sky. \u201coh moon,\u201d she said forlornly. \u201cI perish for kisses. why have you brought me an owl when I desired a man?\u201d She sighed, then softly hooted into the night: how? how? how?\nI slid into the water, not as lithe as an otter perhaps, but somewhat better at kissing.\nA while later we lay in the shallows on a broad sheet of stone worn water-", "smooth. \u201cthank you moon,\u201d Felurian said, looking up at the sky contentedly. \u201cfor this sweet and lusty manling.\u201d\nThere were luminous fishes in the pool. No larger than your hand, each with a stripe or spot of gently glowing color. I watched them emerge from whatever hiding places they had scattered to, startled by the recent turbulence. They were orange as glowing coals, yellow as buttercups, blue as noontime sky.\nFelurian slid back into the water, then tugged at my leg. \u201ccome, my kissing owl,\u201d she said. \u201cand I will show to you the workings of the moon.\u201d\nI followed her into the pool until we stood shoulder deep. The fish came to explore, the braver ones coming close enough to swim between us. Their motion revealed the hidden silhouette of Felurian\u2019s body beneath the water. Despite the fact that I had explored her nakedness in great detail, I suddenly found myself fascinated by the suggested shape of her.\nThe fish came closer still. One brushed me, and I felt a gentle nip against my ribs. I jumped, though its tiny bite was soft as a tapping finger. I watched as more of the fish circled round, occasionally nibbling at us.\n\u201ceven the fish delight in kissing you,\u201d Felurian said, stepping closer to press her wet body against mine.\n\u201cI think they must like the salt on my skin,\u201d I said, looking down at them. She pushed me away, irritated. \u201cmayhap they like the taste of owl.\u201d Before I could make an appropriate reply, she assumed a serious\nexpression, flattened her hand, and lowered it into the water between us. \u201cthere is only one moon,\u201d Felurian said. \u201cshe moves between your mortal\nsky and mine.\u201d She pressed her palm against my chest, then brought it back and pressed it to her own. \u201cshe sways between. back and forth.\u201d She stopped, frowning at me. \u201cbe mindful of my words.\u201d\n\u201cI am,\u201d I lied.\n\u201cno. you are mindful of my breasts.\u201d\nIt was true. They flirted with the surface of the water. \u201cThey are well worth\nminding,\u201d I said. \u201cTo not attend to them would be a terrible insult.\u201d\n\u201cI speak of important things. knowings you must have if you are to return\nsafe to me.\u201d She gave an exasperated sigh. \u201cif I let you touch one, will you attend to my words?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nShe took hold of my hand and pulled it close to cup her breast. \u201cmake waves upon lilies.\u201d", "\u201cYou haven\u2019t shown me waves upon lilies yet.\u201d\n\u201cthat will come later, then.\u201d She put her flat hand back in the water between us, then sighed softly, her eyes going halfway closed. \u201cah,\u201d she said. \u201coh.\u201d\nEventually the fish emerged from their hiding places again.\n\u201cmy most distractible owl,\u201d Felurian said, not unkindly. She dove to the bottom of the pool and returned holding a smooth, round stone. \u201cattend you now to what I say. you are the mortal, I the fae.\u201d\n\u201chere is the moon,\u201d she said, tucking the stone between our palms and lacing our fingers together to hold it. \u201cshe\u2019s tethered tight to both the fae and mortal night.\u201d\nFelurian stepped forward and pressed the stone against my chest. \u201cthus moves the moon,\u201d she said, tightening her fingers around mine. \u201cnow when I look above, there is no glimmer of the light I love. instead, all like a flower unfurled, her face shines on your mortal world.\u201d\nShe stepped back so our arms were straight with our clasped hands between us. Then she pulled the stone toward her chest, dragging me through the water by my hand. \u201cnow all your mortal maidens sigh, for she is fully in my sky.\u201d\nI nodded, understanding. \u201cBeloved by both the Fae and men. Our moon\u2019s a merry wanderer then?\u201d\nFelurian shook her head. \u201cnot so. a traveler, yes. a wanderer, no. she moves but cannot freely go.\u201d\n\u201cI heard a story once,\u201d I said. \u201cAbout a man who stole the moon.\u201d\nFelurian\u2019s expression went solemn. She unlaced her fingers from mine and looked down at the stone in her hand. \u201cthat was the end of it all.\u201d She sighed. \u201cuntil he stole the moon there was some hope for peace.\u201d\nI was stunned by the matter-of-fact tone in her voice. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked dumbly.\n\u201cthe stealing of the moon.\u201d She cocked her head at me, puzzled. \u201cyou said you knew of it.\u201d\n\u201cI said I\u2019d heard a story,\u201d I said. \u201cBut it was a silly thing. Not a story of what truly was. It was a f ... It was the sort of story that you tell a child.\u201d\nShe smiled again. \u201cyou may call them faerie stories. I know of them. they are fancies. we tell our children manling tales betimes.\u201d\n\u201cBut the moon was truly stolen?\u201d I asked. \u201cThat was no fancy?\u201d Felurian scowled. \u201cthis I have been showing you!\u201d she said, bringing her", "hand down in an angry splash.\nI found myself making the Adem gesture for apology below the surface of\nthe water before realizing it was doubly pointless. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cBut without the truth of this story I am lost. I beg of you to tell me it.\u201d\n\u201cit is an old story, and a sad one.\u201d She gave me a long look. \u201cwhat then will you trade me?\u201d\n\u201cThe hushed hart,\u201d I said.\n\u201cin that you give a gift that is a gift to you,\u201d she said archly. \u201cwhat else?\u201d \u201cI will also make thousand hands,\u201d I said, watching her expression soften.\n\u201cAnd I will show you something new I have thought of all myself. I call it swaying against the wind.\u201d\nShe crossed her arms and looked away, making a great show of indifference. \u201cnew perhaps to you. I doubtless know it by a different name.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d I said. \u201cBut if you will not trade you cannot know.\u201d\n\u201cvery well,\u201d she conceded with a sigh. \u201cbut only because you are quite good at thousand hands.\u201d\nFelurian looked up at the slender moon for a moment, then said. \u201clong before the cities of man. before men. before fae. there were those who walked with their eyes open. they knew all the deep names of things.\u201d She paused and looked at me. \u201cdo you know what this means?\u201d\n\u201cWhen you know the name of a thing you have mastery over it,\u201d I said.\n\u201cno,\u201d she said, startling me with the weight of rebuke in her voice. \u201cmastery was not given. they had the deep knowing of things. not mastery. to swim is not mastery over the water. to eat an apple is not mastery of the apple.\u201d She gave me a sharp look. \u201cdo you understand?\u201d\nI didn\u2019t. But I nodded anyway, not wanting to upset her or sidetrack the story.\n\u201cthese old name-knowers moved smoothly through the world. they knew the fox and they knew the hare, and they knew the space between the two.\u201d\nShe drew a deep breath and let it out in a sigh. \u201cthen came those who saw a thing and thought of changing it. they thought in terms of mastery.\n\u201cthey were shapers. proud dreamers.\u201d She made a conciliatory gesture. \u201cand it was not all bad at first. there were wonders.\u201d Her face lit with memory and her fingers gripped my arm excitedly. \u201conce, sitting on the walls of murella, I ate fruit from a silver tree. it shone, and in the dark you could mark the mouth and eyes of all those who had tasted it!\u201d\n\u201cWas Murella in the Fae?\u201d", "Felurian frowned. \u201cno. I have said. this was before. there was but one sky. one moon. one world, and in it was murella. and the fruit. and myself, eating it, eyes shining in the dark.\u201d\n\u201cHow long ago was this?\u201d\nShe gave a small shrug. \u201clong ago.\u201d\nLong ago. Longer than any book of history I had ever seen or even heard\nof. The Archives had copies of Caluptenian histories that went back two millennia, and none of them held the barest whisper of the things Felurian spoke of.\n\u201cForgive my interruption,\u201d I said as politely as possible, and made as much of a bow to her as I could without going entirely underwater.\nMollified, she continued, \u201cthe fruit was but the first of it. the early toddlings of a child. they grew bolder, braver, wild. the old knowers said \u2018stop,\u2019 but the shapers refused. they quarreled and fought and forbade the shapers. they argued against mastery of this sort.\u201d Her eyes brightened. \u201cbut oh,\u201d she sighed, \u201cthe things they made!\u201d\nThis from a woman weaving me a cloak out of shadow. I couldn\u2019t guess what she might marvel at. \u201cWhat did they make?\u201d\nShe gestured widely around us.\n\u201cTrees?\u201d I asked, awestruck.\nShe laughed at my tone. \u201cno. the faen realm.\u201d she waved widely. \u201cwrought\naccording to their will. the greatest of them sewed it from whole cloth. a place where they could do as they desired. and at the end of all their work, each shaper wrought a star to fill their new and empty sky.\u201d\nFelurian smiled at me. \u201cthen there were two worlds. two skies. two sets of stars.\u201d She held up the smooth stone. \u201cbut still one moon. and it all round and cozy in the mortal sky.\u201d\nHer smile faded. \u201cbut one shaper was greater than the rest. for him the making of a star was not enough. he stretched his will across the world and pulled her from her home.\u201d\nLifting the smooth stone to the sky, Felurian carefully closed one eye. She tilted her head as if trying to fit the curve of the stone into the empty arms of the crescent moon above us. \u201cthat was the breaking point. the old knowers realized no talk would ever stop the shapers.\u201d Her hand dropped back into the water. \u201che stole the moon and with it came the war.\u201d\n\u201cWho was it?\u201d I asked.\nHer mouth curved into a tiny smile. She hooted: \u201cwho? who?\u201d", "\u201cWas he of the faen courts?\u201d I prompted gently.\nFelurian shook her head, amused. \u201cno. as I said, this was before the fae. the first and greatest of the shapers.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was his name?\u201d\nShe shook her head. \u201cno calling of names here. I will not speak of that one, though he is shut beyond the doors of stone.\u201d\nBefore I could ask more questions, Felurian took my hand and nestled the stone between our palms again. \u201cthis shaper of the dark and changing eye stretched out his hand against the pure black sky. he pulled the moon, but could not make her stay. so now she moves \u2019twixt mortal and the fae.\u201d\nShe gave me a solemn look, so rare a thing on her fair face. \u201cyou have your tale. your who and how. there is a final secret now. so all your owlish listening lend.\u201d She brought our joined hands back to the surface of the water. \u201cthis is the part on which you must attend.\u201d\nFelurian\u2019s eyes were black in the dim light. \u201cthe moon has our two worlds beguiled, like parents clutching at a child, pulling at her, to and fro, neither willing to let go.\u201d\nShe stepped away, and we stood as far apart as we could, the stone gripped in our hands. \u201cwhen she is torn, half in your sky, you see how far apart we lie.\u201d Felurian reached toward me with her free hand making futile grasping gestures in the empty water. \u201cno matter how we long to kiss, the space between us is not ripe for this.\u201d\nFelurian stepped forward and pressed the stone close to my chest. \u201cand when your moon is waxing full, all of faerie feels the pull. she draws us close to you, so bright. and now a visit for a night is easier than walking through a door or stepping off a ship that\u2019s near the shore.\u201d She smiled at me.\u201c \u2019twas thus while wandering in the wild, you found Felurian, manling child.\u201d\nThe thought of an entire world of fae creatures drawn close by the swelling moon was troubling. \u201cAnd this is true of any fae?\u201d\nShe shrugged and nodded. \u201chave they the will, and know the way. there are a thousand half-cracked doors that lead between my world and yours.\u201d\n\u201cHow have I never heard of this? It seems it would be hard to miss, Fae dancing on the mortal grass. . . .\u201d\nShe laughed. \u201cbut has not just this come to pass? the world is wide and time is long, but still you say you heard my song before you saw me singing there, brushing moonlight through my hair.\u201d\nI frowned. \u201cStill, it seems I should have seen more signs of those who walk", "between.\u201d\nFelurian shrugged. \u201cmost fae are sly and subtle folk who step as soft as\nchimney smoke. some go among your kind enshaedn, glamoured as a pack mule laden, or wearing gowns to fit a queen.\u201d She gave me a frank look. \u201cwe know enough to not be seen.\u201d\nShe took my hand again. \u201cmany of the darker sort would love to use you for their sport. what keeps these from moonlit trespass? iron, fire, mirror- glass. elm and ash and copper knives, solid-hearted farmer\u2019s wives who know the rules of games we play and give us bread to keep away. but worst of all, my people dread the portion of our power we shed when we set foot on mortal earth.\u201d\n\u201cWe are more trouble than we\u2019re worth,\u201d I admitted, smiling.\nFelurian reached out and touched a finger to my mouth. \u201cwhile she is full you may still laugh, but know there is a darker half.\u201d She spun away to arm\u2019s length, pulling me through the water in a slow spiral. \u201ca clever mortal fears the night without a hint of sweet moonlight.\u201d\nShe began to draw my hand to her chest, dragging me through the water toward her as she spun. \u201con such a night, each step you take might catch you in the dark moon\u2019s wake, and pull you all unwitting into fae.\u201d She stopped and gave me a grim look. \u201cwhere you will have no choice but stay.\u201d\nFelurian took a step backward in the water, tugging at me. \u201cand on such unfamiliar ground, how can a mortal help but drown?\u201d\nI took another step toward her and found nothing beneath my feet. Felurian\u2019s hand was suddenly no longer clasping mine, and black water closed over my head. Blind and choking, I began to thrash desperately, trying to find my way back to the surface.\nAfter a long, terrifying moment, Felurian\u2019s hands caught me and dragged me into the air as if I weighed no more than a kitten. She brought me close to her face, her dark eyes hard and glittering.\nWhen she spoke her voice was clear. \u201cI do this so you cannot help but hear. a wise man views a moonless night with fear.\u201d", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THREE\nClose Enough to Touch\nTIME PASSED. FELURIAN TOOK me Dayward to a piece of forest even older and grander than the one that surrounded her twilight glade. There we climbed trees as tall and broad as mountains. In the highest branches, you could feel the vast tree swaying in the wind like a ship on the swelling sea. There, with nothing but the blue sky around us and the slow motion of the tree beneath, Felurian taught me ivy on the oak.\nI tried to teach Felurian tak, only to discover she already knew it. She beat me handily, and played a game so lovely Bredon would have wept to look on it.\nI learned a bit of the Fae tongue. A small bit. A scattering.\nActually, in the interest of pure honesty, I will admit that I failed miserably in my attempt to learn the Fae language. Felurian was a less than patient teacher, and the language bafflingly complex. My failure went beyond mere incompetence to the point where Felurian actually forbade me from attempting to speak it in her presence.\nOverall, I gained a few phrases and a great dollop of humility. Useful things.\nFelurian taught me several faen songs. They were harder for me to remember than mortal songs, their melodies slippery and twisting. When I tried to play them on my lute the strings felt strange beneath my fingers, making me fumble and stutter as if I was some country boy who\u2019d never held a lute before. I learned their lyrics by rote, without the least inkling what the words might mean.\nThrough it all, we continued to work on my shaed. Rather, Felurian worked on it. I asked questions, watched, and tried to avoid feeling like a curious child underfoot in the kitchen. As we grew more comfortable with each other, my questions became more insistent....\n\u201cBut how?\u201d I asked for the tenth time. \u201cLight hasn\u2019t any weight, any substance. It behaves like a wave. You shouldn\u2019t be able to touch it.\u201d", "Felurian had worked her way up from starlight and was wefting moonlight into the shaed. She didn\u2019t look up from her work when she replied, \u201cso many thoughts, my kvothe. you know too much to be happy.\u201d\nThat sounded uncomfortably like something Elodin would say. I brushed the evasion aside. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be able\u2014\u201d\nShe nudged me with her elbow and I saw both her hands were full. \u201csweet flame,\u201d she said, \u201cbring that to me.\u201d She nodded to a moonbeam that pierced the trees above and touched the ground beside me.\nHer voice bore the familiar, subtle tone of command, and without thinking I grabbed the moonbeam as if it were a hanging vine. For a second I felt it against my fingers, cool and ephemeral. Startled, I froze, and suddenly it was an ordinary moonbeam again. I passed my hand through it several times to no effect.\nSmiling, Felurian reached out and took hold of it as if it were the most natural thing in the world. She touched my cheek with her free hand, then turned her attention to her lap and worked the strand of moonlight into the folds of shadow.", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FOUR\nThe Cthaeh\nAFTER FELURIAN HELPED ME discover what I was capable of, I took a more active hand in the creation of my shaed. Felurian seemed pleased at my progress, but I was frustrated. There were no rules to follow, no facts to remember. Because of this, my quick wit and trouper\u2019s memory were of little use to me, and my progress seemed irritatingly slow.\nEventually, I could touch my shaed without fear of damaging it and change its shape according to my desire. With some practice I could turn it from a short cape to a full hooded mourning cloak or anything in between.\nStill, it would be unfair for me to take even a hair of the credit for its creation. Felurian was the one who gathered the shadow, wove it with moon and fire and daylight. My major contribution was the suggestion that it should have numerous little pockets.\nAfter we took the shaed all the way into daylight, I thought our work was done. My suspicions seemed confirmed when we spent a long stretch of time swimming, singing, and otherwise enjoying each other\u2019s company.\nBut Felurian avoided the topic of the shaed whenever I brought it up. I didn\u2019t mind, as her evasions on the subject were always delightful. Because of this, I had the impression some part of it was left unfinished.\nOne morning we awoke in an embrace, spent perhaps an hour kissing to arouse our appetites, then fell to our breakfast of fruit and fine white bread with honeycomb and olives.\nThen Felurian grew serious and asked me for a piece of iron.\nHer request surprised me. Some time ago I had thought to resume a few of my mundane habits. Using the surface of the pool as a mirror, I used my small razor to shave. At first Felurian had seemed pleased by my smooth cheeks and chin, but when I moved to kiss her she pushed me to arm\u2019s length, snorting as if to clear her nose. She told me I reeked of iron and sent me into the forest telling me not to return until I got the bitter stink of it from my face.\nSo it was with no small amount of curiosity that I dug a piece of broken", "iron buckle out of my travelsack. I held it out to her nervously. The way you might hand a child a sharp knife. \u201cWhy do you need it?\u201d I asked, trying to appear unconcerned.\nFelurian said nothing. She held it tightly between her thumb and two forefingers, as if it were a snake struggling to twist around and bite her. Her mouth made a thin line, and her eyes began to brighten from their customary twilight purple to a deep-water blue.\n\u201cCan I help?\u201d I asked.\nShe laughed. Not the light, chiming laugh I had heard so often, but a wild, fierce laugh. \u201cdo you want to help truly?\u201d she asked. The hand holding the shard of iron trembled slightly.\nI nodded, a little frightened.\n\u201cthen go.\u201d Her eyes were still changing, brightening to a bluish-white. \u201cI do not need flame now, or songs, or questions.\u201d When I didn\u2019t move she made a shooing motion. \u201cgo to the forest. do not wander far, but do not trouble me for the time it takes to love four times.\u201d Her voice had changed slightly too. Though still soft, it had taken on a brittle edge that alarmed me.\nI was about to protest when she gave me a terrible look that sent me scampering mindlessly for the trees.\nI wandered aimlessly for a while, trying to regain my composure. This was difficult, as I was baby-naked and had been shooed away from the presence of serious magic the way a mother sends a bothersome child away from the cookfire.\nStill, I knew I wouldn\u2019t be welcome back in the clearing for some time. So I pointed my face Dayward and set off to explore.\nI can\u2019t say why I wandered so far afield that day. Felurian had warned me to stay close, and I knew it to be good advice. Any of a hundred stories from my childhood told me the danger of wandering in the Fae. Even discounting them, the stories Felurian herself had told should have been enough to keep me close to the safety of her twilight grove.\nMy natural curiosity must take some of the blame, I suppose. But most of it belongs to my bruised pride. Pride and folly, they go together like two tightly grasping hands.\nI walked for the better part of an hour as the sky above me slowly brightened into full daylight. I found a path of sorts, but saw nothing living aside from the occasional butterfly or leaping squirrel.\nWith every step I took, my mood teetered between boredom and anxiety. I", "was in the Fae, after all. I should be seeing marvelous things. Castles of glass. Burning fountains. Bloodthirsty trow. Barefoot old men, eager to give me advice ...\nThe trees gave way to a great grassy plain. All the parts of the Fae Felurian had shown me had been forested. So this seemed a clear sign I was well outside the bounds of where I ought to be.\nStill I continued, enjoying the feel of sunlight on my skin after so long in the dim twilight of Felurian\u2019s glade. The trail I followed seemed to be leading to a lone tree standing in the grassy field. I decided I would go as far as that tree, then head back.\nHowever, after walking for a long while I didn\u2019t seem to be coming much closer to the tree. At first I thought this was another oddity of the Fae, but as I continued to make my stubborn way along the path, the truth became clear. The tree was simply larger than I had thought. Much larger and much farther away.\nThe path did not ultimately lead to the tree. In fact, it curved away from it, avoiding it by more than half a mile. I was considering turning back when a bright flutter of color under the tree\u2019s canopy caught my eye. After a brief struggle, my curiosity won out and I stepped off the path into the long grass.\nIt was no type of tree I had ever seen before, and I approached it slowly. It resembled a vast spreading willow, with broader leaves of a darker green. The tree had deep, hanging foliage scattered with pale, powder-blue blossoms.\nThe wind shifted, and as the leaves stirred I smelled a strange, sweet smell. It was like smoke and spice and leather and lemon. It was a compelling smell. Not in the same way that food smells appealing. It didn\u2019t make my mouth water or my stomach growl. Despite this, if I\u2019d seen something sitting on a table that smelled this way, even if it were a lump of stone or a piece of wood, I would have felt compelled to put it in my mouth. Not out of hunger, but from sheer curiosity, much like a child might.\nAs I stepped closer I was struck with the beauty of the scene: the deep green of the leaves contrasted with the butterflies flitting from branch to branch, sipping from the pale blossoms of the tree. What I had taken at first to be a bed of flowers beneath the tree turned out to be a carpet of butterflies almost completely covering the ground. The scene was so breathtaking I stopped several dozen feet away from the tree\u2019s canopy, not wanting to startle them into flight.", "Many of the butterflies flitting among the flowers were purple and black, or blue and black, like those in Felurian\u2019s clearing. Others were a solid, vibrant green, or grey and yellow, or silver and blue. But my eye was caught by a single large red one, crimson shot through with a faint tracery of metallic gold. Its wings were bigger than my spread hand, and as I watched it fluttered deeper into the foliage in search of a fresh flower to light upon.\nSuddenly, its wings were no longer moving in concert. They tumbled apart and fluttered separately to the ground like falling autumn leaves.\nIt was only after my eyes followed them to the base of the tree that I saw the truth. The ground below was not a resting place for butterflies . . . it was strewn with lifeless wings. Thousands of them littered the grass beneath the tree\u2019s canopy, like a blanket of gemstones.\n\u201cThe red ones offend my aesthetic,\u201d claimed a cool, dry voice from the tree.\nI took a step back, trying to peer through the thick canopy of hanging leaves.\n\u201cWhat manners,\u201d chided the dry voice. \u201cNo introduction? Staring?\u201d\n\u201cMy apologies, sir,\u201d I said earnestly. Then, remembering the tree\u2019s flowers, I amended, \u201cMa\u2019am. But I have never spoken with a tree before and find myself at something of a loss.\u201d\n\u201cI daresay you are. I am no tree. No more than is a man a chair. I am the Cthaeh. You are fortunate to find me. Many would envy you your chance.\u201d\n\u201cChance?\u201d I echoed, trying to catch a glimpse of whatever was speaking to me from among the branches of the tree. A piece of an old story tickled my memory, some scrap of folklore I\u2019d read while searching for the Chandrian. \u201cYou\u2019re an oracle,\u201d I said.\n\u201cOracle. How quaint. Do not try to pin me with small names. I am Cthaeh. I am. I see. I know.\u201d Two iridescent blue-black wings fluttered separately where there had been a butterfly before. \u201cAt times I speak.\u201d\n\u201cI thought the red ones offended you?\u201d\n\u201cThere are no red ones left.\u201d The voice was nonchalant. \u201cAnd the blue ones are ever so slightly sweet.\u201d I saw a flicker of movement, and another pair of sapphire wings began spinning slowly to the ground. \u201cYou\u2019re Felurian\u2019s new manling, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I hesitated, but the dry voice continued as if I\u2019d answered. \u201cI thought as much. I can smell the iron on you. Just a hint. Still, one has to wonder how she stands it.\u201d\nA pause. A blur. A slight disturbance of a dozen leaves. Two more wings", "twitched, then fluttered downward. \u201cCome now,\u201d the voice continued, now coming from a different part of the tree, though still hidden by the hanging leaves. \u201cSurely a curious boy is bound to have a question or two. Come. Ask. Your silence much offends me.\u201d\nI hesitated, then said, \u201cI suppose I might have a question or two.\u201d \u201cAhhhh,\u201d the sound was slow and satisfied. \u201cI thought you might.\u201d \u201cWhat can you tell me of the Amyr?\u201d\n\u201cKyxxs,\u201d the Cthaeh spat an irritated noise. \u201cWhat is this? Why so\nguarded? Why the games? Ask me of the Chandrian and have done.\u201d\nI stood, stunned and silent.\n\u201cSurprised? Why should you be? Goodness boy, you\u2019re like a clear pool. I\ncan see ten feet through you, and you\u2019re barely three feet deep.\u201d There was another blur of motion and two pairs of wings went spinning to the ground, one blue, one purple.\nI thought I saw a sinuous motion among the branches, but it was hidden by the endless, wind-brushed swaying of the tree. \u201cWhy the purple one?\u201d I asked, simply to have something to say.\n\u201cPure spite,\u201d the Cthaeh said. \u201cI envied its innocence, its lack of care. Besides, too much sweetness cloys me. As does willful ignorance.\u201d A pause. \u201cYou wish to ask me of the Chandrian, do you not?\u201d\nI could do nothing but nod.\n\u201cNot much to say really,\u201d the Cthaeh remarked flippantly. \u201cYou would do better to call them the Seven though. \u2018Chandrian\u2019 has so much folklore hanging off it after all these years. The names used to be interchangeable, but nowadays if you say Chandrian people think of ogres and rendlings and scaven. Such silliness.\u201d\nThere was a long pause. I stood motionless until I realized the creature was waiting for a response. \u201cTell me more,\u201d I said. My voice sounded terribly thin to my own ears.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I thought I detected a playful note in the voice.\n\u201cBecause I need to know,\u201d I said, trying to force some strength back into my voice.\n\u201cNeed?\u201d Cthaeh asked skeptically. \u201cWhy this sudden need? The masters at the University might know the answers you\u2019re looking for. But they wouldn\u2019t tell you even if you did ask, which you won\u2019t. You\u2019re too proud for that. Too clever to ask for help. Too mindful of your reputation.\u201d\nI tried to speak, but my throat did nothing but make a dry clicking sound. I", "swallowed and tried again. \u201cPlease, I need to know. They killed my parents.\u201d \u201cAre you going to try to kill the Chandrian?\u201d The voice sounded\nfascinated, almost taken aback. \u201cTrack and kill them all yourself? My word, how will you manage it? Haliax has been alive five thousand years. Five thousand years and not one second\u2019s sleep.\n\u201cClever to go looking for the Amyr, I suppose. Even one proud as you can recognize the need for help. The Order might give it to you. Trouble is they\u2019re as hard to find as the Seven themselves. Oh dear, oh dear. Whatever is a brave young boy to do?\u201d\n\u201cTell me!\u201d I meant to shout it, but it came out pleading.\n\u201cIt would be frustrating, I suppose,\u201d the Cthaeh continued calmly. \u201cThe few people who believe in the Chandrian are too afraid to talk, and everyone else will just laugh at you for asking.\u201d There was a dramatic sigh that seemed to come from several places in the foliage at once. \u201cThat\u2019s the price you pay for civilization though.\u201d\n\u201cWhat price?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cArrogance,\u201d the Cthaeh said. \u201cYou assume you know everything. You laughed at faeries until you saw one. Small wonder all your civilized neighbors dismiss the Chandrian as well. You\u2019d have to leave your precious corners far behind before you found someone who might take you seriously. You wouldn\u2019t have a hope until you made it to the Stormwal.\u201d\nThere was a pause, then another pair of purple wings went drifting to the ground. I swallowed against the dryness in my throat, trying to think of what question I could ask to get more information.\n\u201cNot many folk will take your search for the Amyr seriously, you realize,\u201d the Cthaeh continued calmly. \u201cThe Maer, however, is quite the extraordinary man. He\u2019s already come close to them, though he doesn\u2019t realize it. Stick by the Maer and he will lead you to their door.\u201d\nThe Cthaeh gave a thin, dry chuckle. \u201cBlood, bracken, and bone, I wish you creatures had the wit to appreciate me. Whatever else you might forget, remember what I just said. Eventually you\u2019ll get the joke. I guarantee. You\u2019ll laugh when the time comes.\u201d\n\u201cWhat can you tell me about the Chandrian?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cSince you ask so sweetly, Cinder is the one you want. Remember him? White hair? Dark eyes? Did things to your mother, you know. Terrible. She held up well though. Laurian was always a trouper, if you\u2019ll pardon the expression. Much better than your father, with all his begging and", "blubbering.\u201d\nMy mind flashed pictures of things I had tried to forget for years. My\nmother, her hair wet with blood, her arms unnaturally twisted, broken at the wrist, the elbow. My father, his belly cut open, had left a trail of blood for twenty feet. He\u2019d crawled to be closer to her. I tried to speak, but my mouth was dry. \u201cWhy?\u201d I managed to croak.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d the Cthaeh echoed. \u201cWhat a good question. I know so many whys. Why did they do such nasty things to your poor family? Why, because they wanted to, and because they could, and because they had a reason.\n\u201cWhy did they leave you alive? Why, because they were sloppy, and because you were lucky, and because something scared them away.\u201d\nWhat scared them away? I thought numbly. But it was all too much. The memories, the things the voice said. My mouth worked silently, questioning.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d the Cthaeh asked. \u201cAre you looking for a different why? Are you wondering why I tell you these things? What good comes of it? Maybe this Cinder did me a bad turn once. Maybe it amuses me to set a young pup like you snapping at his heels. Maybe the soft creaking of your tendons as you clench your fists is like a sweet symphony to me. Oh yes it is. And you can be sure.\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you find this Cinder? Well, that\u2019s an interesting why. You\u2019d think a man with coal-black eyes would make an impression when he stops to buy a drink. How can it be that you haven\u2019t managed to catch wind of him in all this time?\u201d\nI shook my head, trying to clear it of the smell of blood and burning hair.\nThe Cthaeh seemed to take it as a signal. \u201cThat\u2019s right, I suppose you don\u2019t need me to tell you what he looks like. You\u2019ve seen him just a day or three ago.\u201d\nRealization thundered into me. The leader of the bandits. The graceful man in chain mail. Cinder. He was the one who had spoken to me when I was a child. The man with the terrible smile and the sword like winter ice.\n\u201cPity he got away,\u201d the Cthaeh continued. \u201cStill, you must admit you\u2019ve had quite a piece of luck. I\u2019d say it was a twice-in-a-lifetime-opportunity meeting up with him again. Pity you wasted it. Don\u2019t feel bad you didn\u2019t recognize him. They have a lot of experience hiding those telltale signs. Not your fault at all. It\u2019s been a long time. Years. Besides, you\u2019ve been busy: currying favor, rolling around in the cushions with some piksie, sating your base desires.\u201d", "Three green butterflies twitched all at once. Their wings looked like leaves as they spun to the ground.\n\u201cSpeaking of desires, what would your Denna think? My my. Imagine her, seeing you here. You and the piksie all tangled up, at it like rabbits. He beats her, you know. Her patron. Not all the time, but often. Sometimes in a temper, but mostly it\u2019s a game to him. How far can he go before she cries? How far can he push before she tries to leave and he has to lure her back again? It\u2019s nothing grotesque, mind you. No burns. Nothing that will leave a scar. Not yet.\n\u201cTwo days ago he used his walking stick. That was new. Welts the size of your thumb under her clothes. Bruises down to the bone. She\u2019s trembling on the floor with blood in her mouth and you know what she thinks before the black? You. She thinks of you. You thought of her too, I\u2019m guessing. In between the swimming and strawberries and the rest.\u201d\nThe Cthaeh made a sound like a sigh. \u201cPoor girl, she\u2019s tied to him so tight. Thinks that\u2019s all she\u2019s good for. Wouldn\u2019t leave him even if you asked. Which you won\u2019t. You, so careful. So scared of startling her away. And well you should be too. She\u2019s a runner, that one. Now that she\u2019s left Severen, how can you hope to find her?\n\u201cIt is a shame you left without a word, you know. She was just beginning to trust you before that. Before you got angry. Before you ran off. Just like every other man in her life. Just like every other man. Lusting after her, full of sweet words, then just walking away. Leaving her alone. Good thing she\u2019s used to it by now, isn\u2019t it? Otherwise you might have hurt her. Otherwise you just might have broken that poor girl\u2019s heart.\u201d\nIt was all too much. I turned and ran, pelting madly back the way I had come. Back to the quiet twilight of Felurian\u2019s clearing. Away. Away. Away.\nAnd as I ran I could hear Cthaeh speaking behind me. Its dry, quiet voice followed me longer than I would have thought possible. \u201cCome back. Come back. I\u2019ve more to say. I\u2019ve so much more to tell you, won\u2019t you stay?\u201d\nIt was hours before I came back to Felurian\u2019s clearing. I\u2019m not sure how I found my way. I only remember being surprised at the sight of her pavilion through the trees. The sight of it slowed the mad spinning of my thoughts\n \nuntil I could begin to think again.\nI went to the pool and took a long, deep drink, splashing water on my face\nto clear my head and hide the signs of tears. After a moment or two of quiet reflection, I stood and walked to the pavilion. It was only then that I noticed a curious lack of butterflies. There were usually at least a handful flitting around, but now there were none.\nFelurian was there, but the sight of her only unsettled me further. It was the only time I had ever seen her look less than perfectly beautiful. She lay among the cushions, drawn and weary. As if I had been gone for days instead of hours, and she had not eaten or slept all the while.\nShe lifted her head tiredly when she heard me approach. \u201cit is done,\u201d she said, but when she looked at me her eyes widened with surprise.\nI looked down and saw that I was bramble-torn and bloody. I was spattered with mud and grass stained along my entire left side. I must have fallen during my mindless flight away from the Cthaeh.\nFelurian sat upright. \u201cwhat has come of you?\u201d\nI brushed absently at a bit of dried blood on my elbow. \u201cI might ask the same of you.\u201d My voice sounded thick and coarse, as if I had been shouting. When I looked up I saw real concern in her eyes. \u201cI went walking Dayward. I found something in a tree. It called itself a Cthaeh.\u201d\nFelurian went motionless when I spoke its name. \u201cthe Cthaeh? did you speak?\u201d\nI nodded.\n\u201cdid you ask of it?\u201d But before I could answer she gave a quiet, despairing cry and rushed to me. She began to run her hands over my body, as if searching for wounds. After a minute of this she took my face in her hands and looked into my eyes as if frightened of what she might find there. \u201care you well?\u201d\nHer concern brought a faint smile to my lips. I began to assure her that I was fine\u2014then I remembered the things the Cthaeh had said. I remembered the fires and the man with ink-black eyes. I thought of Denna sprawled on the floor with a mouthful of blood. Tears came to my eyes and I choked. I turned away and shook my head, eyes clenched shut and unable to speak.\nShe stroked the back of my neck and said, \u201call is well. the hurt will go. it has not bit you, and your eyes are clear, so all is well.\u201d\nI pulled away from her enough to look her in the face. \u201cMy eyes?\u201d \u201cthe things the Cthaeh says can leave men broken in their heads. but I", "would see if it were so. you are still my kvothe, still my sweet poet.\u201d She leaned forward, oddly hesitant, then gave me a gentle kiss on my forehead.\n\u201cIt lies to men and drives them mad?\u201d\nShe shook her head slowly, \u201cthe Cthaeh does not lie. it has the gift of seeing, but it only tells things to hurt men. only a dennerling would speak to the Cthaeh.\u201d She touched the side of my neck to soften her words.\nI nodded, knowing it to be the truth. And I began to cry.", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIVE\nInterlude\u2014A Certain Sweetness\nKVOTHE MOTIONED FOR CHRONICLER to stop writing. \u201cAre you all right, Bast?\u201d He gave his student a look of concern. \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve swallowed a lump of iron.\u201d\nBast did look stricken. His face was pale, almost waxy. His normally cheerful expression was aghast. \u201cReshi,\u201d he said, his voice as dry as autumn leaves. \u201cYou never told me you spoke with the Cthaeh.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things I\u2019ve never told you, Bast,\u201d Kvothe said flippantly. \u201cThat\u2019s why you find the sordid details of my life so enthralling.\u201d\nBast gave a sickly smile, shoulders sagging with relief. \u201cYou didn\u2019t really, then. Talk with it, I mean? It\u2019s something you just added to make things a little more colorful?\u201d\n\u201cPlease, Bast,\u201d Kvothe said, obviously offended. \u201cMy story has quite enough color without my adding to it.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me!\u201d Bast shouted suddenly, coming halfway out of his seat with the force of it. \u201cDon\u2019t you lie to me about this! Don\u2019t you dare!\u201d Bast struck the table with one hand, toppling his mug and sending Chronicler\u2019s inkwell skittering across the table.\nQuick as blinking, Chronicler snatched up the half-covered sheet of paper and pushed his chair back from the table with his feet, saving the sheet from the sudden spray of ink and beer.\nBast leaned forward, his face livid as he stabbed a finger at Kvothe. \u201cI don\u2019t care what other shit you spin into gold here! But you don\u2019t lie about this, Reshi! Not to me!\u201d\nKvothe gestured to where Chronicler sat, holding the pristine sheet of paper in the air with both hands. \u201cBast,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is my chance to tell the full and honest story of my life. Everything is\u2014\u201d\nBast closed his eyes and pounded the table like a child in the grip of a tantrum. \u201cShut up. Shut up! SHUT UP!\u201d\nBast pointed at Chronicler. \u201cI don\u2019t give a fiddler\u2019s fuck what you tell him,", "Reshi. He\u2019ll write what I say or I\u2019ll eat his heart in the market square!\u201d He turned the finger back to the innkeeper and shook it furiously. \u201cBut you\u2019ll tell me the truth and you\u2019ll tell me now!\u201d\nKvothe looked up at his student, the amusement bleeding out of his face. \u201cBast, we both know I\u2019m not above the occasional embellishment. But this story is different. This is my chance to get the truth of matters recorded. It\u2019s the truth behind the stories.\u201d\nThe dark young man hunched forward in his chair and covered his eyes with one hand.\nKvothe looked at him, his face full of concern. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d Bast shook his head, still covering his eyes.\n\u201cBast,\u201d Kvothe said gently. \u201cYour hand is bleeding.\u201d He waited a long\nmoment before asking, \u201cBast, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s just it!\u201d Bast burst out, throwing his arms wide, his voice high and\nhysterical. \u201cI think I finally understand what the matter is!\u201d\nBast laughed then, but it was loud and strained, and choked off into\nsomething that sounded like a sob. He looked up at the rafters of the taproom, his eyes bright. He blinked, as if fighting back tears.\nKvothe leaned forward to lay his hand on the young man\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBast, please . . .\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that you know so many things,\u201d Bast said. \u201cYou know all sorts of things you\u2019re not supposed to. You know about the Berentaltha. You know about the white sisters and the laughing-way. How can you not know about the Cthaeh? It\u2019s . . . it\u2019s a monster.\u201d\nKvothe relaxed visibly. \u201cGood Lord, Bast, is that all? You had me all in a sweat. I\u2019ve faced down things far worse than\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t anything worse than the Cthaeh!\u201d Bast shouted, bringing his clenched fist down on the tabletop again. This time there was the sharp sound of tearing wood as one of the thick timbers bowed and cracked. \u201cReshi, shut up and listen. Really listen.\u201d Bast looked down for a moment, choosing his words carefully. \u201cYou know who the Sithe are?\u201d\nKvothe shrugged. \u201cThey\u2019re a faction among the Fae. Powerful, with good intentions\u2014\u201d\nBast waved his hands. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand them if you use the term \u2018good intentions.\u2019 But if any of the Fae can be said to work for the good, it\u2019s them. Their oldest and most important charge is to keep the Cthaeh from having any contact with anyone. With anyone.\u201d", "\u201cI didn\u2019t see any guards,\u201d Kvothe said in the tones a man might use to soothe a skittish animal.\nBast ran his hands through his hair, leaving it in disarray. \u201cI can\u2019t for all the salt in me guess how you slipped past them, Reshi. If anyone manages to come in contact with the Cthaeh, the Sithe kill them. They kill them from a half-mile off with their long horn bows. Then they leave the body to rot. If a crow so much as lands on the body, they kill it too.\u201d\nChronicler cleared his throat gently, then spoke up. \u201cIf what you\u2019re saying is true,\u201d he asked, \u201cwhy would anyone go to the Cthaeh?\u201d\nBast looked for a moment as if he would snap at the scribe, then gave a bitter sigh instead. \u201cIn all fairness, my people are not known for making good decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery Fae girl and boy knows the Cthaeh\u2019s nature, but there\u2019s always someone eager to seek it out. Folk go to it for answers or a glimpse of the future. Or they hope to come away with a flower.\u201d\n\u201cA flower?\u201d Kvothe asked.\nBast gave him another startled look. \u201cThe Rhinna?\u201d Not seeing any recognition in the innkeeper\u2019s face he shook his head in dismay. \u201cThe flowers are a panacea, Reshi. They can heal any illness. Cure any poison. Mend any wound.\u201d\nKvothe raised his eyebrows at that. \u201cAh,\u201d he said, looking down at his folded hands on the tabletop. \u201cI see. I can understand how that might draw a person in, though they knew better.\u201d\nThe innkeeper looked up. \u201cI have to admit I don\u2019t see the trouble,\u201d he said apologetically. \u201cI\u2019ve seen monsters, Bast. The Cthaeh falls short of that.\u201d \u201cThat was the wrong word for me to use, Reshi,\u201d Bast admitted. \u201cBut I\ncan\u2019t think of a better one. If there was a word that meant poisonous and hateful and contagious, I\u2019d use that.\u201d\nBast drew a deep breath and leaned forward in his chair. \u201cReshi, the Cthaeh can see the future. Not in some vague, oracular way. It sees all the future. Clearly. Perfectly. Everything that can possibly come to pass, branching out endlessly from the current moment.\u201d\nKvothe raised an eyebrow. \u201cIt can, can it?\u201d\n\u201cIt can,\u201d Bast said gravely. \u201cAnd it is purely, perfectly malicious. This isn\u2019t a problem for the most part, as it can\u2019t leave the tree. But when someone comes to visit ...\u201d\nKvothe\u2019s eyes went distant as he nodded to himself. \u201cIf it knows the future perfectly,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cthen it must know exactly how a person will react", "to anything it says.\u201d\nBast nodded. \u201cAnd it is vicious, Reshi.\u201d\nKvothe continued in a musing tone. \u201cThat means anyone influenced by the\nCthaeh would be like an arrow shot into the future.\u201d\n\u201cAn arrow only hits one person, Reshi.\u201d Bast\u2019s dark eyes were hollow and\nhopeless. \u201cAnyone influenced by the Cthaeh is like a plague ship sailing for a harbor.\u201d Bast pointed at the half-filled sheet Chronicler held in his lap. \u201cIf the Sithe knew that existed, they would spare no effort to destroy it. They would kill us for having heard what the Cthaeh said.\u201d\n\u201cBecause anything carrying the Cthaeh\u2019s influence away from the tree . . .\u201d Kvothe said, looking down at his hands. He sat silently for a long moment, nodding thoughtfully. \u201cSo a young man seeking his fortune goes to the Cthaeh and takes away a flower. The daughter of the king is deathly ill, and he takes the flower to heal her. They fall in love despite the fact that she\u2019s betrothed to the neighboring prince ...\u201d\nBast stared at Kvothe, watching blankly as he spoke.\n\u201cThey attempt a daring moonlight escape,\u201d Kvothe continued. \u201cBut he falls from the rooftops and they\u2019re caught. The princess is married against her will and stabs the neighboring prince on their wedding night. The prince dies. Civil war. Fields burned and salted. Famine. Plague . . .\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the story of the Fastingsway War,\u201d Bast said faintly.\nKvothe nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the stories Felurian told. I never understood the part about the flower until now. She never mentioned the Cthaeh.\u201d\n\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have, Reshi. It\u2019s considered bad luck.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNo, not bad luck. It\u2019s like spitting poison in someone\u2019s ear. It simply isn\u2019t done.\u201d\nChronicler recovered some of his composure and slid his chair back toward the table, still holding the sheet carefully. He frowned at the table, broken and streaked with beer and ink. \u201cIt seems like this creature has quite a reputation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I find it hard to believe it\u2019s quite as dangerous as all that. . . .\u201d\nBast looked at Chronicler incredulously. \u201cIron and bile,\u201d he said, his voice quiet. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m a child? You think I don\u2019t know the difference between a campfire story and the truth?\u201d\nChronicler made a mollifying gesture with one hand. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I ...\u201d\nWithout taking his eyes from Chronicler, Bast laid his bloody palm flat on the table. The wood groaned and the broken timbers snapped back into place", "with a sudden crackling sound. Bast lifted his hand, then brought it down sharply on the table, and the dark runnels of ink and beer suddenly twisted and shaped themselves into a jet-black crow that burst into flight, circling the taproom once.\nBast caught it with both hands and tore the bird carelessly in half, casting the pieces into the air where they exploded into great washes of flame the color of blood.\nIt all happened in the space of a single breath. \u201cEverything you know about the Fae could fit inside a thimble,\u201d Bast said, looking at the scribe with no expression at all, his voice flat and even. \u201cHow dare you doubt me? You have no idea who I am.\u201d\nChronicler sat very still, but he did not look away.\n\u201cI swear it by my tongue and teeth,\u201d Bast said crisply. \u201cI swear it on the doors of stone. I am telling you three thousand times. There is nothing in my world or yours more dangerous than the Cthaeh.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that, Bast,\u201d Kvothe said softly. \u201cI believe you.\u201d\nBast turned to look at Kvothe, then sagged miserably in his chair. \u201cI wish you didn\u2019t, Reshi.\u201d\nKvothe gave a wry smile. \u201cSo after a person meets the Cthaeh, all their choices will be the wrong ones.\u201d\nBast shook his head, his face pale and drawn. \u201cNot wrong, Reshi, catastrophic. Iax spoke to the Cthaeh before he stole the moon, and that sparked the entire creation war. Lanre spoke to the Cthaeh before he orchestrated the betrayal of Myr Tariniel. The creation of the Nameless. The Scaendyne. They can all be traced back to the Cthaeh.\u201d\nKvothe\u2019s expression went blank. \u201cWell, that certainly puts me in interesting company, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d he said dryly.\n\u201cIt does more than that, Reshi,\u201d Bast said. \u201cIn our plays, if the Cthaeh\u2019s tree is shown in the distance in the backdrop, you know the story is going to be the worst kind of tragedy. It\u2019s put there so the audience knows what to expect. So they know everything will go terribly wrong in the end.\u201d\nKvothe looked at Bast for a long moment. \u201cOh Bast,\u201d he said softly to his student. His smile was gentle and sad. \u201cI know what sort of story I\u2019m telling. This is no comedy.\u201d\nBast looked up at him with hollow, hopeless eyes. \u201cBut Reshi ...\u201d His mouth moved, trying to find words and failing.\nThe red-haired innkeeper gestured at the empty taproom. \u201cThis is the end", "of the story, Bast. We all know that.\u201d Kvothe\u2019s voice was matter-of-fact, as casual as if he were describing yesterday\u2019s weather. \u201cI have led an interesting life, and this reminiscence has a certain sweetness to it. But . . .\u201d\nKvothe drew a deep breath and let it out gently. \u201c. . . but this is not a dashing romance. This is no fable where folk come back from the dead. It\u2019s not a rousing epic meant to stir the blood. No. We all know what kind of story this is.\u201d\nIt seemed for a moment that he would continue, but instead his eyes wandered idly around the empty taproom. His face was calm, without a trace of anger or bitterness.\nBast darted a look at Chronicler, but this time there was no fire in it. No anger. No fury or command. Bast\u2019s eyes were desperate, pleading.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not over if you\u2019re still here,\u201d Chronicler said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a tragedy if you\u2019re still alive.\u201d\nBast nodded eagerly at this, looking back at Kvothe.\nKvothe looked at both of them for a moment, then smiled and chuckled low in his chest. \u201cOh,\u201d he said fondly. \u201cYou\u2019re both so young.\u201d", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX\nReturning\nAFTER MY ENCOUNTER WITH the Cthaeh, it was a long time before I was my right self again.\nI slept a great deal, but only fitfully as I was endlessly set upon by terrible dreams. Some of them were vivid and impossible to forget. These were mostly of my mother, my father, my troupe. Worse were the ones where I woke weeping with no memory of what I\u2019d dreamed, only an aching chest and an emptiness in my head like the bloody gap left by a missing tooth.\nThe first time I awoke like this, Felurian was there, watching me. Her expression was so gentle and worried that I expected her to murmur softly to me and stroke my hair, as Auri had done in my room months ago.\nBut Felurian did nothing of the sort. \u201care you well?\u201d she asked.\nI had no answer for this. I was blurry with memory, confusion, and grief. Not trusting myself to speak without bursting into tears again, I merely shook my head.\nFelurian bent down and kissed me on the corner of my mouth, looked at me for a long moment, and sat back up. Then she went to the pool and brought me back a drink of water in her cupped hands.\nOver the following days Felurian did not press me with questions or try to draw me out. She occasionally tried to tell me stories, but I couldn\u2019t focus on them, so they made less sense than ever. Some parts made me weep uncontrollably, though the stories themselves had nothing in them that was sad.\nOnce I woke to find her gone, only to have her return hours later carrying a strange green fruit bigger than my head. She smiled shyly and handed it to me, showing me how to peel off the thin leathery skin to reveal the orange meat inside. Pulpy and tangy-sweet, it pulled apart in spiraling segments.\nWe ate these silently, until nothing was left but a round, hard, slippery seed. It was dark brown and so big I could not close my hand around it. With a slight flourish, Felurian cracked this open against a rock and showed me", "that the inside was dry, like a roasted nut. We ate this too. It tasted dark and peppery, vaguely reminiscent of smoked salmon.\nNestled inside that was another seed, white as bone and the size of a marble. This Felurian gave to me. It was candy-sweet and slightly gummy, like a caramel.\nOne time she left me alone for endless hours, only to return with two brown birds, one carefully cupped in each hand. They were smaller than sparrows, with striking, leaf-green eyes. She set them down next to where I lay on the cushions, and when she whistled, they began to sing. Not snippets of birdsong, they sang an actual song. Four verses with a chorus between. First they sang together, then in a simple harmony.\nOnce I woke and she gave me a drink in a leather cup. It smelled of violets and tasted of nothing at all, but it was clear and warm and clean in my mouth, like I was drinking summer sunlight.\nAnother time she gave me a smooth red stone that was warm in my hand. After several hours it hatched like an egg, revealing a creature like a tiny squirrel that chittered angrily at me before running away.\nOnce I woke and she was not nearby. Looking around I saw her sitting on the edge of the water, arms wrapped around her knees. I could barely hear the gentle song of her sobbing quietly to herself.\nI slept and I woke. She gave me a ring made from a leaf, a cluster of golden berries, a flower that opened and closed at the stroking of a finger....\nAnd once, when I startled awake with my face wet and my chest aching, she reached out to lay her hand on top of mine. The gesture was so tentative, her expression so anxious, you would think she had never touched a man before. As if she was worried I might break or burn or bite. Her cool hand lay on mine for a moment, gentle as a moth. She squeezed my hand softly, waited, then pulled away.\nIt struck me as odd at the time. But I was too clouded with confusion and grief to think clearly. Only now, looking back, do I realize the truth of things. With all the awkwardness of a young lover, she was trying to comfort me, and she didn\u2019t have the slightest idea how.\nStill, all things mend with time. My dreams receded. My appetite returned. I\n \ngrew clearheaded enough to banter with Felurian a bit. Shortly after that, I recovered enough to flirt. When this happened, her relief was palpable, as if she couldn\u2019t relate to a creature that did not want to kiss her.\nLast came my curiosity, the surest sign I was my own true self again. \u201cI never asked you how went your final workings with the shaed,\u201d I said.\nHer face lit. \u201cit is done!\u201d I could see the pride in her eyes. She took my hand and pulled me to the edge of the pavilion. \u201cthe iron was not an easy thing, but it is done.\u201d She started forward, then stopped herself. \u201ccan you find it?\u201d\nI took a long, careful look around. Even though she\u2019d taught me what to look for, it was a long moment before I spotted a subtle depth in the darkness of a nearby tree. I reached out and drew my shaed from the concealing shadow.\nFelurian skipped to my side, laughing as if I had just won a game. She caught me around the neck and kissed me with the wildness of a dozen children.\nShe had never let me wear the shaed before, and I marveled as she spread it over my naked shoulders. It was nearly weightless and softer than the richest velvet. It felt like wearing a warm breeze, the same breeze that had brushed me in the darkened forest glade where Felurian had taken me to gather the shadows.\nI thought of going to the forest pool to see how I looked in the water\u2019s reflection, but Felurian threw herself onto me. Bearing me to the ground, she landed astride me, my shaed spread beneath us like a thick blanket. She gathered the edges of it around us, then kissed my chest, my neck. Her tongue was hot against my skin.\n\u201cthis way,\u201d she said against my ear, \u201cwhenever your shaed wraps you, you will think of me. when it touches you it will seem like my touch.\u201d She moved slowly against me, rubbing the length of her naked body along mine. \u201cthrough all the other women you will remember Felurian, and you will return.\u201d\nAfter that I knew my time in the Fae was drawing to a close. The Cthaeh\u2019s words stuck in my mind like burrs, goading me out into the world. The fact\n \nthat I had been within a stone\u2019s throw of the man who had killed my parents and not realized it left a bitter taste in my mouth that even Felurian\u2019s kisses could not erase. And what the Cthaeh had said of Denna kept playing over and over in my head.\nEventually I awoke and knew the time had come. I rose, put my travelsack in order, and dressed for the first time in ages. The feeling of clothes against my skin felt odd after all this time. How long had I been gone? I brushed my fingers through my beard and shrugged the thought away. Guessing was pointless when I would know the answer soon enough.\nTurning, I saw Felurian standing in the center of the pavilion, her expression sad. For a moment I thought she might protest my leaving, but she did nothing of the sort. Moving to my side, she fastened the shaed around my shoulders, reminding me of a mother dressing her child against the cold. Even the butterflies that followed her seemed melancholy.\nShe led me through the forest for hours until we came to a pair of tall greystones. She drew up the hood of my shaed and bid me close my eyes. Then she led me in a brief circle and I felt a subtle change in the air. When I opened my eyes I could tell this forest was not the same one I had been walking through a moment before. The strange tension in the air was gone. This was the mortal world.\nI turned to Felurian. \u201cMy lady,\u201d I said. \u201cI have nothing to give you before I go.\u201d\n\u201cexcept your promise to return.\u201d Her voice was lily soft, with a whisper of a warning.\nI smiled. \u201cI mean I have nothing to leave you with, lady.\u201d\n\u201cexcept remembrance.\u201d She leaned close.\nClosing my eyes, I bid her farewell with few words and many kisses. Then I left. I would like to say I did not look back, but that would not be\nthe truth. The sight of her almost broke my heart. She seemed so very small beside the huge grey stones. I almost went back to give one final kiss, one last good-bye.\nBut I knew if I went back, I would never manage to leave again. Somehow I kept walking.\nWhen I looked back the second time, she was gone.", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SEVEN\nFire\nI CAME TO THE PENNYSWORTH Inn long after the sun had set. The huge inn\u2019s windows swelled with lamplight and there were a dozen horses tethered outside, champing into their feed bags. The door was open, casting a slant square of light into the dark street.\nBut something was wrong. There was none of the pleasant rousing clamor that should be coming from a busy inn at night. Not a whisper. Not a word.\nAnxious, I crept closer. Every faerie tale I\u2019d ever heard was running through my head. Had I been gone years? Decades?\nOr was it more ordinary trouble? Had there been more bandits than we thought? Had they returned to find their camp destroyed, then come here to make trouble?\nI slid close to a window, peered inside, and saw the truth.\nThere were forty or fifty people in the inn. They sat at tables and benches and lined up at the bar. Every eye was pointed at the hearth.\nMarten sat there, taking a long drink. \u201cI couldn\u2019t look away,\u201d he continued. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to. Then Kvothe stepped in front of me, blocking the sight of her, and for a second I was free of her spell. I was covered in a sweat so thick and cold it felt like someone had thrown a bucket of water over me. I tried to pull him back, but he shook me off and ran to her.\u201d Marten\u2019s expression was lined with regret.\n\u201cHow come she didn\u2019t get the Adem and the big one too?\u201d asked a man with a hawkish face sitting nearby on the corner of the hearth. He drummed his fingers on a battered fiddle case. \u201cIf you\u2019d really seen her, you all would have run off after her.\u201d\nThere was a murmur of agreement from the room.\nTempi spoke up from a nearby table, his blood-red shirt making him easy to spot. \u201cWhen I was growing, I train to have control.\u201d He held up a hand and made a tight fist to illustrate his point. \u201cHurt. Hungry. Thirsty. Tired.\u201d He shook his fist after each of these to show his mastery over it. \u201cWomen.\u201d The", "faintest of smiles touched his face and he shook his fist again, but with none of the firmness he had used before. A murmur of laughter ran through the room. \u201cI say this. If Kvothe did not go, I may.\u201d\nMarten nodded. \u201cAs for our other friend ...\u201d He cleared his throat and gestured across the room. \u201cHespe convinced him to stay.\u201d There was more laughter at this. After a moment of searching I spied where Dedan and Hespe sat. Dedan seemed to be fighting down a furious blush. Hespe rested a hand possessively on his leg. She smiled a private, satisfied smile.\n\u201cThe next day we looked for him,\u201d Marten said, regaining the room\u2019s attention. \u201cWe followed his trail through the woods. We found his sword half a mile from the pool. No doubt he lost it in his haste to catch her. His cloak hung from a branch not far from there.\u201d\nMarten lifted up the threadbare cloak I had bought from the tinker. It looked like it had been savaged by a mad dog. \u201cIt was caught on a branch. He must have torn free rather than lose sight of her.\u201d He idly fingered the ripped edges. \u201cIf it had been made of stronger stuff he might still be with us here tonight.\u201d\nI know my cue when I hear it. I stepped through the doorway and felt everyone turn to look at me. \u201cI have found a better cloak since,\u201d I said. \u201cMade by Felurian\u2019s own hand. And I have a story too. One you will be telling your children\u2019s children.\u201d I smiled.\nThere was a moment of silence, then an uproar as everyone began to speak at once.\nMy companions stared at me in stunned disbelief. Dedan was the first to recover, and after making his way to where I stood, surprised me with a rough, one-armed embrace. Only then did I notice one of his arms was hanging from his neck in a splint.\nI gave it a questioning look. \u201cDid you run into trouble?\u201d I asked while the room buzzed chaotically around us.\nDedan shook his head. \u201cHespe,\u201d he said simply. \u201cShe didn\u2019t take too kindly to the thought of me running off after that faerie woman. She sort of... convinced me to stay.\u201d\n\u201cShe broke your arm?\u201d I remembered my parting glimpse of Hespe holding him to the ground.\nThe big man looked down at his feet. \u201cA bit. She sort of held onto it while I tried to twist away.\u201d He gave a slightly sheepish smile. \u201cI guess you could say we broke it together.\u201d", "I clapped him on his good shoulder and laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s sweet. Truly touching.\u201d I would have continued, but the room had quieted. Everyone was watching us, watching me.\nAs I looked at the crowd of people, I felt suddenly disoriented. How can I explain... ?\nI\u2019ve already told you I don\u2019t know how much time I spent in the Fae. But it had been a long, long while. I had lived there so long, that the strangeness of it had faded. I\u2019d grown comfortable there.\nNow that I was back in the mortal world, this crowded taproom seemed strange to me. How odd to be indoors, rather than under the naked sky. The thick-timbered wooden benches and tables looked so primitive and rough. The lamplight seemed unnaturally bright and harsh to my eyes.\nI\u2019d had no company but Felurian for ages, and the people around me seemed strange by comparison. The whites of their eyes were startling. They smelled like sweat and horses and bitter iron. Their voices were hard and sharp. Their postures stiff and awkward.\nBut that only scratches the bare surface of it. I felt out of place in my own skin. It was profoundly irritating to be wearing clothes again, and I wanted nothing more than to be comfortably naked. My boots felt like a prison. On my long walk to the Pennysworth, I\u2019d had to constantly fight the urge to remove them.\nLooking at the faces around me, I saw a young woman of no more than twenty. She had a sweet face and clear blue eyes. She had a perfect mouth for kissing. I took half a step towards her, fully intending to catch her up in my arms and . . .\nI stopped suddenly, just as I began to reach out with one hand to caress the side of her neck, and my head spun with something very close to vertigo. Things were different here. The man sitting beside the woman was obviously her husband. That was important, wasn\u2019t it? It seemed a very vague and distant fact. Why wasn\u2019t I already kissing this woman? Why wasn\u2019t I naked, eating violets, and playing music underneath the open sky?\nLooking around the room again, everything seemed terribly ridiculous. These people sitting on their benches, wearing layers on layers of clothing, eating with knives and forks. It all struck me as so pointless and contrived. It was incredibly funny. It was like they were playing a game and didn\u2019t even realize it. It was like a joke I\u2019d never understood before.\nAnd so I laughed. It wasn\u2019t loud or particularly long, but it was high and", "wild and full of strange delight. It was no human laugh, and it moved through the crowd like wind among the wheat. Those near enough to hear it shifted in their seats, some looking at me with curiosity, some with fear. Some shivered and refused to meet my eye.\nSeeing their reaction shook me, and I made an effort to get a grip on myself. I drew a deep breath and closed my eyes. The moment of strange disorientation passed, though my boots still felt hard and heavy on my feet.\nWhen I opened my eyes again, I saw Hespe looking up at me. She spoke hesitantly. \u201cKvothe,\u201d she said hesitantly. \u201cYou look . . . well.\u201d\nI smiled wide. \u201cI am.\u201d\n\u201cWe thought you were . . . lost.\u201d\n\u201cYou thought I was gone,\u201d I corrected gently as I made my way to the\nfireplace where Marten stood. \u201cDead in Felurian\u2019s arms or wandering the forest, mad and broken with desire.\u201d I looked at them each in turn. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right?\u201d\nI felt the whole room\u2019s eyes on me and decided to make the most of the situation. \u201cCome now, I am Kvothe. I am Edema Ruh born. I have studied at the University and can call down lightning like Taborlin the Great. Did you really think Felurian would be the death of me?\u201d\n\u201cShe would be,\u201d said a rough voice from the edge of the hearth. \u201cIf you had ever so much as seen her shadow.\u201d\nI turned to see the hawk-faced fiddler. \u201cI beg your pardon, sir?\u201d\n\u201cYou should beg the pardon of everyone here,\u201d he said, his voice dripping with disdain. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you hope to gain from this, but I don\u2019t believe the lot of you saw Felurian, not for a second.\u201d\nI met his eyes. \u201cI did more than see her, friend.\u201d\n\u201cIf that were true, then you\u2019d be mad now, or dead. And while I\u2019ll admit you might be mad, it\u2019s not from any faerie charm.\u201d The room chuckled at this. \u201cNo one has seen her in a score of years. The fair folk have left this place behind, and you\u2019re no Taborlin, no matter what your friends say. I\u2019m guessin\u2019 you\u2019re just a clever storyteller hopin\u2019 to make a name for himself.\u201d\nThat struck uncomfortably close to the mark, and I could see some of the crowd eyeing me skeptically.\nBefore I could say anything Dedan burst in. \u201cWhat about his beard then? When he ran off three nights ago his face was smooth as a baby\u2019s ass.\u201d\n\u201cSo you say,\u201d the fiddler replied. \u201cI was going to keep quiet even though I didn\u2019t believe half what you told us about those bandits or him calling the", "lightning. But I thought to myself, \u2018Their friend probably died and they want folks to remember him with a proud story or two.\u2019 \u201d\nHe looked down his broken nose to where Dedan sat. \u201cBut really, this has gone too far. It\u2019s not wise to tell lies about the fair folk. I don\u2019t appreciate strangers coming here and spinning my friends\u2019 heads full of nonsense. Be quiet, the lot of you. We\u2019ve heard enough out of you tonight.\u201d\nHaving said his piece, the fiddler opened the battered case that sat next to him and drew out his instrument. The mood of the room had grown vaguely hostile by this point, and more than a few people eyed me resentfully.\nDedan sputtered angrily. \u201cNow listen h\u2014\u201d Hespe said something and tried to pull him down into his seat, but Dedan shook her off. \u201cNo. I won\u2019t be called a liar. We were sent here by Alveron himself because of them bandits. And we did our job. We\u2019re not expecting a parade, but I\u2019ll be damned before I let you call me a liar. We killed those bastards. And afterward we did see Felurian. And Kvothe there did take off after her.\u201d\nDedan glared around the room belligerently, mostly in the direction of the fiddler. \u201cThat\u2019s the truth and I swear it by my good right hand. If anyone wants to call me a liar we can have it out right now.\u201d\nThe fiddler picked up his bow and met Dedan\u2019s eye. He drew a screaming note across the strings. \u201cLiar.\u201d\nDedan nearly leapt across the room as people pushed their chairs back to make a clear space for the fight. The fiddler came to his feet slowly. He was taller than I\u2019d expected, with short grey hair and scarred knuckles that told me he knew his way around a fistfight.\nI managed to get in front of Dedan and leaned against him, speaking low in his ear, \u201cDo you really want to brawl with a broken arm? If he gets hold of it, you\u2019ll just scream and piss yourself in front of Hespe.\u201d I felt him relax a bit and gave him a gentle push back toward his seat. He went, but he wasn\u2019t happy.\n\u201c... something here.\u201d I heard a woman say behind me. \u201cIf you want to have a scuff with someone you take it outside and don\u2019t bother coming back. You don\u2019t get paid to fight the customers. You hear?\u201d\n\u201cNow Penny,\u201d the fiddler said soothingly. \u201cI was just showin\u2019 some teeth to him. He\u2019s the one took it all personal. You can\u2019t blame me for makin\u2019 fun with the sort of stories they come in with.\u201d\nI turned around and saw the fiddler explaining himself to an angry woman in her middle years. She was a full foot shorter than him, and had to reach up", "to jab his chest with a finger.\nThat\u2019s when I heard a voice exclaim to one side of me, \u201cGod\u2019s mother,\nSeb. You see that? Look at it! It\u2019s movin\u2019 by itself.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re blind drunk. It\u2019s just a breeze.\u201d\n\u201cThere ain\u2019t no wind in tonight. It\u2019s moving itself. Look again!\u201d\nIt was my shaed, of course. By now several people had noticed it blowing\ngently in a breeze that wasn\u2019t there. I thought the effect was rather nice, but I could tell by their wide eyes that folk were becoming alarmed. One or two slid their chairs away from me uneasily.\nPenny\u2019s eyes were fixed on my gently flowing shaed, and she walked over to stand in front of me. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked, her voice showing just a hint of fear.\n\u201cNothing to worry over,\u201d I said easily, holding out a fold of it for her inspection. \u201cIt is my shadow cloak. Felurian made it for me.\u201d\nThe fiddler made a disgusted noise.\nPenny shot him a look and hesitantly brushed my cloak with a hand. \u201cIt\u2019s soft,\u201d she murmured, looking up at me. When our eyes met she looked surprised for a moment, then exclaimed, \u201cYou\u2019re Losi\u2019s boy!\u201d\nBefore I could ask what she meant, I heard a woman\u2019s voice say, \u201cWhat?\u201d I turned to see a red-haired serving girl moving toward us. The same one who had embarrassed me so badly on our first visit to the Pennysworth.\nPenny nodded toward me. \u201cIt\u2019s your fresh-faced fiery boy from about three span back! You remember pointing him out to me? I didn\u2019t recognize him with the beard.\u201d\nLosi came to stand in front of me. Bright red curls tumbled over the bare, pale skin of her shoulders. Her dangerous green eyes swept over my shaed and made their slow way up to my face. \u201cIt\u2019s him all right,\u201d she said sideways to Penny. \u201cBeard or no.\u201d\nShe took a step closer, almost pressing against me. \u201cBoys are always wearing beards and hoping it will make them men.\u201d Her bright emerald eyes settled boldly onto mine as if expecting me to blush and fumble about as I had before.\nI thought of everything I\u2019d learned at the hands of Felurian, and felt the strange, wild laughter welling up in me again. I fought it down as best I could, but I could feel it tumbling around inside me as I met her eye and smiled.\nLosi took a startled half-step back, her pale skin blushing to a furious red.", "Penny held out a hand to steady her. \u201cLord girl, what\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d\nLosi tore her eyes away from me. \u201cLook at him Penny, really look at him. He\u2019s got a fae look about him. Look at his eyes.\u201d\nPenny looked curiously at my face, then flushed a bit herself and crossed her arms in front of her chest, as if I had seen her naked. \u201cMerciful lord,\u201d she said breathlessly. \u201cIt\u2019s all true, then. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cEvery word,\u201d I said.\n\u201cHow did you get away from her?\u201d Penny asked.\n\u201cOh come on, Penny!\u201d the fiddler cried out in disbelief. \u201cYou aren\u2019t buyin\u2019\nthis pup\u2019s story, are ya?\u201d\nLosi turned and spoke hotly. \u201cThere\u2019s a look a man has when he knows his\nway around a woman, Ben Crayton. Not that you would know. When this one was here a couple span ago I liked his face and thought I\u2019d have a roll with him. But when I tried to trip him . . .\u201d She trailed off, seemingly at a loss for words.\n\u201cI remember that,\u201d a man at the bar called out. \u201cFunniest damn thing. I thought he was gonna piss himself. He couldn\u2019t say a word to her.\u201d\nThe fiddler shrugged. \u201cSo he found some farmer\u2019s daughter since then. It don\u2019t mean . . .\u201d\n\u201cHush Ben,\u201d Penny said with quiet authority. \u201cThere\u2019s more changed here than a bit of beard can account for.\u201d Her eyes searched my face. \u201cLord but you\u2019re right, girl. There is a fae look about him.\u201d The fiddler started to speak again but Penny shot him a sharp look. \u201cHush or get out. I don\u2019t want any fights in here tonight.\u201d\nThe fiddler looked around the room and saw the tide had turned against him. Red-faced and scowling, he gathered up his fiddle and stormed out.\nLosi stepped close to me again, brushing her hair back. \u201cWas she really as beautiful as they say?\u201d Her chin went up proudly. \u201cMore beautiful than me?\u201d\nI hesitated, then spoke softly. \u201cShe was Felurian, most beautiful of all.\u201d I reached out to brush the side of her neck where her red hair began its curling tumble downward, then leaned forward and whispered seven words into her ear. \u201cFor all that, she lacked your fire.\u201d And she loved me for those seven words, and her pride was safe.\nPenny spoke up. \u201cHow did you manage to get away?\u201d\nI looked around the room and felt everyone\u2019s attention settle onto me. The wild, fae laughter tumbled around inside me. I smiled a lazy smile. My shaed", "billowed.\nThen I moved to the front of the room, sat on the hearth, and told them the\nstory.\nOr rather, I told them a story. If I\u2019d told them the entire truth they wouldn\u2019t\nhave believed it. Felurian let me go because I was holding a song hostage? It simply didn\u2019t fit the classic lines.\nSo what I told them was closer to the story they expected to hear. In that story, I chased Felurian into the Fae. Our bodies tangled together in her twilight glade. Then, as we rested, I played her music light enough to make her laugh, music dark enough to make her gasp, music sweet enough to make her weep.\nBut when I tried to leave the Fae, she would not let me. She was too fond of my . . . artistry.\nI shouldn\u2019t be coy, I suppose. I implied rather strongly that Felurian thought quite highly of me as a lover. I offer no apology for this behavior except to say that I was a young man of sixteen, proud of my newfound skills, and not above a little bragging.\nI told them how Felurian had tried to trap me in the Fae, how we fought with magic. For this I borrowed a little from Taborlin the Great. There was fire and lightning.\nAt the end I bested Felurian but spared her life. In her gratitude she wove me a faerie cloak, taught me secret magics, and gave me a silver leaf as a token of her favor. The leaf was pure fabrication, of course. But it wouldn\u2019t have been a proper story if she hadn\u2019t given me three gifts.\nAll in all, it was a good story. And if it wasn\u2019t entirely true . . . well, at least it had some truth mixed in. In my defense, I could have dispensed with the truth entirely and told a much better story. Lies are simpler, and most of the time they make better sense.\nLosi watched me all through the telling, and seemed to take the whole thing as something of a challenge to the prowess of mortal women. After the story was over, she laid claim to me and led me to her small room on the topmost floor of the Pennysworth.\nI managed very little sleep that night, and Losi came closer to killing me than Felurian ever had. She was a delightful partner, every bit as wonderful as Felurian had been.\nBut how could that be? I hear you ask. How could any mortal woman compare with Felurian?", "It is easier to understand if you think of it in terms of music. Sometimes a man enjoys a symphony. Elsetimes he finds a jig more suited to his taste. The same holds true for lovemaking. One type is suited to the deep cushions of a twilight forest glade. Another comes quite naturally tangled in the sheets of narrow beds upstairs in inns. Each woman is like an instrument, waiting to be learned, loved, and finely played, to have at last her own true music made.\nSome might take offense at this way of seeing things, not understanding how a trouper views his music. They might think I degrade women. They might consider me callous, or boorish, or crude.\nBut those people do not understand love, or music, or me.", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED EIGHT\nQuick\nWE SPENT A FEW days at the Pennysworth while our welcome was warm. We had our own rooms and all our meals for free. Fewer bandits meant safer roads and more customers, and Penny knew our presence at the inn would draw a better crowd than fiddle playing any night.\nWe put the time to good use, enjoying hot meals and soft beds. All of us could use the time to mend. Hespe was still nursing her arrow-shot leg, Dedan his broken arm. My own minor injuries from the fight with the bandits were long since gone, but I had newer ones, mostly consisting of a heavily scratched back.\nI taught Tempi the basics of the lute, and he resumed teaching me how to fight. My training consisted of short, terse discussions concerning the Lethani and long, strenuous periods of practicing the Ketan.\nI also pieced together a song about my Felurian experience. I originally called it \u201cIn Twilight Versed,\u201d which you have to admit wasn\u2019t a very good title. Luckily, the name didn\u2019t stick and these days most folk know it as \u201cThe Song Half-Sung.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t my best work, but it was easy to remember. The customers at the inn seemed to enjoy it, and when I heard Losi whistling it as she served drinks, I knew it would spread like a fire in a seam of coal.\nSince folk kept asking for stories, I shared a few other interesting events from my life. I told them how I\u2019d managed to get admitted into the University when I was barely fifteen years old. I told them how I\u2019d gained entry to the Arcanum in a mere three days\u2019 time. I told them how I had called the name of the wind in a furious rage after Ambrose broke my lute.\nUnfortunately, by the third night, I was out of true stories. And, since my audience was still hungry for more, I simply stole a story about Illien and put myself in his place instead, stealing a few pieces from Taborlin while I was at it.\nI\u2019m not proud of that, and in my defense, I\u2019d like to say I\u2019d had quite a bit", "to drink. What\u2019s more, there were a few pretty women in my audience. There is something powerfully beguiling about the excited eyes of a young woman. They can pull all manner of nonsense out of a foolish young man, and I was no exception to this rule.\nMeanwhile, Dedan and Hespe occupied the small exclusive world new lovers make for themselves. They were a delight to watch. Dedan was gentler, quieter. Hespe\u2019s face lost much of its hardness. They spent a great deal of time in their room. Catching up on their sleep, no doubt.\nMarten flirted outrageously with Penny, drank enough to drown a fish, and generally enjoyed himself enough for any three men.\nWe left the Pennysworth after three days, not wanting to wear our welcome thin. I for one was glad to go. Between Tempi\u2019s training and Losi\u2019s attentions I was nearly dead from exhaustion.\nWe made slow time on the road back to Severen. Part of this was out of concern for Hespe\u2019s injured leg, but some of it was because we knew our time together was drawing to an end. Despite our difficulties, we had become close, and it is hard to leave such things behind.\nNews of our adventures had run ahead of us on the road. So when we stopped for the night our meals and beds were easy to come by, if not free.\nOn our third day out of the Pennysworth, we ran across a small troupe of performers. They weren\u2019t Edema Ruh and looked rather out at the heels. There were just four of them: an older fellow, two men in their twenties, and a boy of eight or nine. They were packing up their rickety cart just as we were stopping to give Hespe\u2019s leg a bit of a rest.\n\u201cHello the troupers,\u201d I called out.\nThey looked up nervously, then relaxed as they saw the lute across my back. \u201cHello the bard.\u201d\nI laughed and shook their hands. \u201cNo bard here, just a bit of a singer.\u201d\n\u201cHello the same,\u201d the older man said, smiling. \u201cWhich way are you heading?\u201d\n\u201cNorth to south. Yourself?\u201d\nThey relaxed further once they knew I was heading in a different direction. \u201cEast to west,\u201d he said.\n \n\u201cHow\u2019s your luck been?\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cPoor enough lately. But we\u2019ve heard tell of a Lady Chalker who lives two days off. They say she never turns a man away if he can fiddle a bit or mum a play. We hope to come off with a penny or two.\u201d\n\u201cThings were better when we had the bear,\u201d one of the younger men said. \u201cFolk\u2019ll pay to see a bear-bait.\u201d\n\u201cWent sick of a dog bite,\u201d the other man explained to me. \u201cDied near a year ago.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a shame,\u201d I said. \u201cBear\u2019s hard to come by.\u201d They nodded a silent agreement. \u201cI\u2019ve got a new song for you. What will you trade me for it?\u201d\nHe eyed me warily. \u201cWell now, new to you isn\u2019t exactly new to us,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cAnd a new song ain\u2019t necessarily a good song, if you know what I mean.\u201d\n\u201cJudge for yourself,\u201d I said as I uncased my lute. I\u2019d written it to be easy to remember and simple to sing, but I still had to repeat it twice before he caught all of it. As I\u2019ve said, they weren\u2019t Edema Ruh.\n\u201cA good enough song,\u201d he admitted grudgingly. \u201cEveryone likes Felurian, but I don\u2019t know what we can trade you for it.\u201d\nThe young boy piped up, \u201cI made up a verse to \u2018Tinker Tanner.\u2019 \u201d The others tried to hush him, but I smiled. \u201cI\u2019d love to hear it.\u201d The boy puffed himself up and sang out in a piping voice:\nI once saw a fair farmer\u2019s daughter On the riverbank far from all men She was taking a bath when I saw her Said she didn\u2019t feel right\nIf a man caught a sight\nSo she soaped herself slowly all over again.\nI laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d I complimented him, \u201cBut how about this?\nI once saw a fair farmer\u2019s daughter\nOn the riverbank far from all men.\nShe confessed to me once when I caught her That she didn\u2019t feel clean\nIf her bathing was seen\nSo she washed herself over again.", "The boy thought about it. \u201cI like mine better,\u201d he said after a moment\u2019s consideration.\nI patted him on the back. \u201cIt\u2019s a good man that sticks to his own verse.\u201d I turned back to the leader of the little troupe. \u201cAny gossip?\u201d\nHe thought for a moment. \u201cBandits north of here in the Eld.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cThey\u2019ve been cleared out now, so I\u2019ve heard.\u201d\nHe thought some more. \u201cI heard Alveron\u2019s getting married to the Lackless\nwoman.\u201d\n\u201cI know a poem about Lackless!\u201d The young boy chimed in again, and\nbegan:\nSeven things stand before\nThe entrance to the Lackless door\u2014\n\u201cHush.\u201d The older man cuffed the boy gently along side of his head. He looked up apologetically. \u201cBoy\u2019s got a good ear, but not one lick of manners.\u201d\n\u201cActually,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019d like to hear it.\u201d\nHe shrugged and let go of the boy, who glared at him before reciting:\nSeven things stand before\nThe entrance to the Lackless door.\nOne of them a ring unworn\nOne a word that is forsworn\nOne a time that must be right\nOne a candle without light\nOne a son who brings the blood\nOne a door that holds the flood\nOne a thing tight-held in keeping\nThen comes that which comes with sleeping.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those riddle rhymes,\u201d the father said apologetically. \u201cLord knows where he hears them, but he knows better than to go spouting every lewd thing he hears.\u201d\n\u201cWhere did you hear it?\u201d I asked.\nThe boy thought for a moment, then shrugged and began to scratch himself behind his knee. \u201cDunno. Kids.\u201d", "\u201cWe should be getting on,\u201d the older man said, looking up at the sky. I dug into my purse, and handed him a silver noble. \u201cWhat\u2019s this then?\u201d he asked, eyeing it suspiciously.\n\u201cTo help with a new bear,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve been through some tight times too, but I\u2019m flush now.\u201d\nThey left after thanking me profusely. Poor fellows. No self-respecting Ruh troupe would ever stoop to bearbaiting. There was no skill involved, no pride in the performance.\nBut they could hardly be blamed for the their lack of Ruh blood, and we troupers have to watch out for each other. No one else does.\nTempi and I used our walking hours to discuss the Lethani and evenings to practice the Ketan. It was becoming easier for me, and I could sometimes make it as far as Catching Rain before Tempi caught some minuscule mistake and made me start over.\nThe two of us had found a halfway secluded place beside the inn where we had stopped for the day. Dedan, Hespe, and Marten were inside drinking. I worked my way carefully through the Ketan while Tempi sat with his back to a tree, practicing a basic fingering drill I had taught him with relentless determination. Over and over. Over and over.\nI had just made it through Circling Hands when I caught a flicker of movement from the corner of my eye. I did not pause, as Tempi had taught me to avoid distraction while performing the Ketan. If I turned to look I would have to start over again.\nMoving with painful slowness I began Dance Backwards. But as soon as I placed my heel, I could tell my balance was wrong. I waited for Tempi to call out, but he didn\u2019t.\nI stopped the Ketan and turned to see a group of four Adem mercenaries walking toward us with a prowling grace. Tempi was already on his feet and walking toward them. My lute was back in its case and leaning up against the side of the tree.\nSoon the five of them were standing in a tight group, close enough that their shoulders almost touched. Close enough that I couldn\u2019t hear the barest whisper of what they were saying or even see their hands. But I could tell\n \nfrom the angle of Tempi\u2019s shoulders that he was uncomfortable, defensive. I knew calling out to Tempi would be considered rude, so I walked over.\nBut before I came close enough to hear, one of the unfamiliar mercenaries stretched out a hand and pushed me away, his spread fingers pressing firmly against the center of my chest.\nWithout thinking, I made Break Lion, taking hold of his thumb and turning his wrist away from me. He loosed his hand from mine without any apparent effort and moved to trip me with Chasing Stone. I made Dance Backwards and got the balance right this time, but his other hand struck me in the temple just enough to dizzy me for half a second, not hard enough to even hurt.\nMy pride stung though. It was the same way Tempi struck me in silent rebuke for sloppy performance of the Ketan.\n\u201cQuick,\u201d the mercenary said softly in Aturan. It was only when I heard her voice that I realized she was a woman. Not that she was particularly masculine, it was simply that she seemed so similar to Tempi. She had the same sandy hair, pale grey eyes, calm expression, blood-red clothes. She was taller than Tempi by a few inches, and her shoulders were broader than his. But while she was whipcord thin, the tightness of her mercenary reds still revealed the lean curves of hip and breast.\nLooking more closely, I could easily see three of the four mercenaries were women. The broad-shouldered one facing me had a thin scar cutting through her eyebrow and another close to her jaw. They were the same pale silver scars Tempi had on his arms and chest. And while they were far from gruesome, they made her expressionless face look oddly grim.\n\u201cQuick\u201d she had said. On the surface it seemed to be a compliment, but I\u2019ve been mocked enough in my life to recognize it, regardless of the language.\nEven worse, her right hand slid all the way around to rest in the small of her back, palm facing out. Even with my rudimentary knowledge of Adem hand-talk I knew what that meant. Her hand was as far as it could possibly get from the hilt of her sword. At the same time, she turned her shoulder to me and looked away. I wasn\u2019t just being declared unthreatening, this was insultingly dismissive.\nI fought to keep my face calm, guessing any expression would only further lower her opinion of me.\nTempi pointed back where I had come from. \u201cGo,\u201d he said. Serious. Formal.", "I reluctantly obeyed, not wanting to make a scene.\nThe Adem stood in a close knot a quarter hour as I practiced the Ketan. Though I didn\u2019t hear a whisper of their conversation, it was obvious they were arguing. Their gestures were sharp and angry, the placement of their feet aggressive.\nEventually the four unfamiliar Adem left, walking back toward the road. Tempi returned to where I was trying to work my way through Threshing Wheat.\n\u201cToo wide.\u201d Irritation. He tapped my back leg and pushed my shoulder to show my balance was lacking.\nI moved my foot and tried again. \u201cWho were they, Tempi?\u201d\n\u201cAdem,\u201d he said simply, sitting himself back down at the foot of the tree. \u201cDid you know them?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Tempi looked around, then brought my lute out of its case. With his\nhands occupied, he was doubly mute. I went back to practicing the Ketan, knowing that trying to pry answers out of him would be like pulling teeth.\nTwo hours passed, and the sun began to sink behind the western trees. \u201cTomorrow I leave,\u201d he said. With both his hands still on the lute, I could only guess at his mood.\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\u201cTo Haert. To Shehyn.\u201d\n\u201cAre those cities?\u201d\n\u201cHaert is city. Shehyn is my teacher.\u201d\nI had given some thought to what might be the matter. \u201cAre you in trouble\nfor teaching me?\u201d\nHe set the lute back in the case and pressed the lid back in place.\n\u201cPerhaps.\u201d Yes.\n\u201cIs it forbidden?\u201d\n\u201cIt is most forbidden,\u201d he said.\nTempi stood and began the Ketan. I followed him, and both of us were\nquiet for a while.\n\u201cHow much trouble?\u201d I asked eventually.\n\u201cMost trouble,\u201d he said, and I heard an uncharacteristic shred of emotion in\nhis voice, anxiety. \u201cIt was perhaps unwise.\u201d\nTogether we moved as slowly as the setting sun.\nI thought of what the Cthaeh had said. The one shred of potentially useful\ninformation it had let slip in our conversation. You laughed at faeries until", "you saw one. Small wonder all your civilized neighbors dismiss the Chandrian as well. You\u2019d have to leave your precious corners far behind before you found someone who might take you seriously. You wouldn\u2019t have a hope until you made it to the Stormwal.\nFelurian had said the Cthaeh only spoke the truth.\n\u201cCould I accompany you?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cAccompany?\u201d Tempi asked, his hands moving in a graceful circle\nintended to break the long bones of the arm. \u201cTravel with. Follow. To Haert.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWould it help your trouble?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cI will come.\u201d \u201cI thank you.\u201d", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED NINE\nBarbarians and Madmen\nTRUTHFULLY, I WANTED NOTHING more than to make my way back to Severen. I wanted to sleep in a bed again and take advantage of the Maer\u2019s favor while it was still fresh in his mind. I wanted to find Denna and make things right between us.\nBut Tempi was in trouble for teaching me. I couldn\u2019t simply run off and leave him to face that by himself. What\u2019s more, the Cthaeh had told me Denna had already left Severen behind. Though I hardly needed a prophetic faerie to tell me that. I\u2019d been gone for a month, and Denna was never the sort to let grass grow under her feet.\nSo the next morning our group parted ways. Dedan, Hespe, and Marten were going south to Severen to report to the Maer and collect their pay. Tempi and I were heading northeast toward the Stormwal and Ademre.\n\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want me to take him the box?\u201d Dedan asked for the fifth time.\n\u201cI promised the Maer I\u2019d return any monies to him personally,\u201d I lied. \u201cBut I do need you to give him this.\u201d I handed the big mercenary the letter I\u2019d written the night before. \u201cIt explains why I had to make you the leader of the group.\u201d I grinned. \u201cYou might get a bonus out of it.\u201d\nDedan puffed up importantly as he took hold of the letter.\nStanding nearby, Marten made a noise that could have been a cough.\nAs Tempi and I traveled, I managed to coax a few details from the mercenary. Eventually I learned it was customary for someone of his social standing to gain permission before he took a student of his own.\nComplicating matters was the fact that I was an outsider. A barbarian. In teaching a person like me, it seems like Tempi had done more than violate a\n \ncustom. He had broken a trust with his teacher and his people.\n\u201cWill there be a trial of some sort?\u201d I asked.\nHe shook his head. \u201cNo trial. Shehyn will ask me questions. I will say, \u2018I\nsaw in Kvothe good iron waiting. He is of Lethani. He needs Lethani to guide him.\u2019 \u201d\nTempi nodded at me. \u201cShehyn will ask you of the Lethani to see if I were right in my seeing. Shehyn will decide if you are iron worth striking.\u201d His hand circled, making the gesture for uneasy.\n\u201cAnd what will happen if I am not?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cFor you?\u201d Uncertainty. \u201cFor me? I will be cut away.\u201d\n\u201cCut away?\u201d I asked, hoping I misunderstood.\nHe held up a hand and wiggled his fingers. \u201cAdem.\u201d He made a tight fist\nand shook it. \u201cAdemre.\u201d Then he opened his hand and touched his little finger. \u201cTempi.\u201d He touched the other fingers. \u201cFriend. Brother. Mother.\u201d He touched the thumb. \u201cShehyn.\u201d Then he made a gesture as if paring off his little finger and throwing it away. \u201cCut away,\u201d he said.\nNot killed then, but exiled. I started to breathe easier until I looked in Tempi\u2019s pale eyes. For just a moment there was a crack in his perfect, placid mask, and behind it I saw the truth. Death would be a kinder punishment than being cut away. He was terrified, as frightened as anyone I had ever seen.\nWe agreed our best hope was for me to put myself entirely in Tempi\u2019s hands during the trip to Haert. I had approximately fifteen days to polish what I knew to a bright shine. The hope being that when I met Tempi\u2019s superiors, I could make a good impression.\nBefore we began that first day, Tempi instructed me to put my shaed away. Reluctantly, I did so. It folded down into a surprisingly small bundle that stowed easily into my travelsack.\nThe pace Tempi set was grueling. First the two of us moved through the dancer\u2019s stretch I had watched many times before. Then, instead of our usual brisk walk, we ran for an hour. Then we performed the Ketan with Tempi correcting my endless mistakes. Then we walked a mile.\nFinally, we sat and discussed the Lethani. The fact that these discussions were in Ademic did not make matters easier, but we agreed I should immerse\n \nmyself in the language so when I reached Haert I could speak as a civilized person.\n\u201cWhat is the purpose of the Lethani?\u201d Tempi asked. \u201cTo give us a path to follow?\u201d I replied.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tempi said sternly. \u201cThe Lethani is not a path.\u201d \u201cWhat is the purpose of the Lethani, Tempi?\u201d\n\u201cTo guide us in our actions. By following the Lethani, you act rightly.\u201d \u201cIs this not a path?\u201d\n\u201cNo. The Lethani is what helps us choose a path.\u201d\nThen we would begin the cycle again. Run an hour, perform the Ketan,\nwalk a mile, discuss the Lethani. It took about two hours, and after our brief discussion was finished, we began again.\nAt one point in our discussion of the Lethani I began to make the gesture for understatement. But Tempi lay his hand on top of mine, stopping me.\n\u201cWhen we are having talk about the Lethani, you are to make none of this.\u201d His left hand moved quickly through excitement, negation, and several others gestures I didn\u2019t recognize.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nTempi thought for a moment. \u201cWhen you speak of Lethani, it should not come from here,\u201d he tapped on my head. \u201cOr here.\u201d He tapped on my chest over my heart and ran his fingers down to my left hand. \u201cTrue knowing of the Lethani lives deeper. Lives here.\u201d He prodded me in the stomach, below my navel. \u201cYou must speak from here, without thinking.\u201d\nAs we continued, I slowly came to understand the unspoken rules to our discussions. Not only was it intended to teach me the Lethani, it was supposed to reveal how deeply rooted understanding of the Lethani had become within me.\nThat meant questions were to be answered quickly, with none of the deliberate pauses that usually marked Ademic conversation. You were not supposed to give a thoughtful answer, you were supposed to give an earnest one. If you truly understood the Lethani, that knowledge would become obvious in your answers.\nRun. Ketan. Walk. Discuss. We completed the cycle three times before our midday break. Six hours. I was covered in sweat and half-convinced I would die. After an hour to rest and eat, we were off again. We finished another three cycles before we stopped for the night.\nWe made camp by the side of the road. I chewed my supper half-asleep,", "spread my blanket, and wrapped myself in my shaed. In my exhausted state it seemed soft and warm as a down eider.\nIn the middle of the night, Tempi shook me awake. Though some deep animal part of me hated him, I knew it was necessary as soon as I stirred. My body was stiff and aching, but the slow, familiar movements of the Ketan helped loosen my tight muscles. He made me stretch and drink water, then I slept like a stone for the remainder of the night.\nThe second day was worse. Even strapped tightly to my back, my lute became a miserable burden. The sword I couldn\u2019t even use dragged at my hip. My travelsack felt heavy as a millstone, and I regretted not letting Dedan take the Maer\u2019s box. My muscles were rubbery and disloyal, and when we ran my breath burned in my throat.\nThe moments when Tempi and I spoke of Lethani were the only real rest, but they were disappointingly brief. My mind spun with exhaustion, and it took all my concentration to pull my thoughts into order, trying to give proper answers. Even so, my responses only irritated him. Time after time he shook his head, explaining how I was wrong.\nEventually I gave up trying to be right. Too weary to care, I quit pulling my exhausted thoughts into order, and simply enjoyed sitting down for a few minutes. I was too weary to remember what I said half the time, but, surprisingly, Tempi found those answers more to his liking. That was a blessing. When my answers pleased him, our discussions lasted longer, and I could spend more time resting.\nI felt considerably better the third day. My muscles no longer ached as badly. My breath came easier. My head felt clear and light, like a leaf floating on the wind. In this frame of mind, answers to Tempi\u2019s questions tripped easily off the tip of my tongue, simple as singing.\nRun. Ketan. Walk. Discuss. Three cycles. Then, as we moved through the Ketan on the side of the road, I collapsed.\nTempi had been watching closely and caught me before I hit the ground. My world spun dizzily for a few minutes before I realized I was in the shade of a tree at the side of the road. Tempi must have carried me there.\nHe held out my waterskin. \u201cDrink.\u201d\nThe thought of water was not appealing, but I took a mouthful anyway. \u201cI am sorry, Tempi.\u201d\nHe shook his head. \u201cYou came far before falling. You did not complain. You showed your mind is stronger than your body. That is good. When the", "mind controls the body, that is of the Lethani. But knowing your limit is also of the Lethani. It is better to stop when you must than run until you fall.\u201d\n\u201cUnless falling is what the Lethani requires,\u201d I said without thinking. My head still felt light as a windblown leaf.\nHe gave me a rare smile. \u201cYes. You are beginning to see.\u201d\nI returned his smile. \u201cYour Aturan is coming very well, Tempi.\u201d Tempi blinked. Worry. \u201cWe are speaking my language, not yours.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not speaking ...\u201d I started to protest, but as I did I listened to the\nwords I was using. Sceopa teyas. My head reeled for a moment.\n\u201cDrink again,\u201d Tempi said, and though his face and voice were carefully\ncontrolled, I could tell he was concerned.\nI took another sip to pacify him. Then, as if my body suddenly realized it\nneeded the water, I became very thirsty and took several large swallows. I stopped before I drank too much and cramped my stomach. Tempi nodded, approval.\n\u201cAm I speaking well then?\u201d I said to distract myself from my thirst.\n\u201cYou are speaking well for a child. Very well for a barbarian.\u201d\n\u201cOnly well? Am I making the words wrong?\u201d\n\u201cYou touch eyes too much.\u201d He widened his eyes and stared pointedly into\nmy own, unblinking. \u201cAlso, your words are good, but simple.\u201d\n\u201cYou must teach me more words then.\u201d\nHe shook his head. Serious. \u201cYou already know too many words.\u201d \u201cToo many? Tempi, I know very few.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not the words, it is their use. In Adem there is an art to speaking.\nThere are those who can say many things in one thing. My Shehyn is such. They say a thing in one breath and others will find meaning in it for a year.\u201d Gentle reproach. \u201cToo often you say more than you need. You should not speak in Ademic as you sing in Aturan. A hundred words to praise a woman. Too many. Our talk is smaller.\u201d\n\u201cSo when I meet a woman, I should simply say, \u2018You are beautiful?\u2019 \u201d\nTempi shook his head. \u201cNo. You would say simply \u2018beautiful,\u2019 and let the woman decide the rest of what you mean.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that . . .\u201d I didn\u2019t know the words for \u201cvague\u201d or \u201cunspecific\u201d and had to start again to get my point across. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that lead to confusion?\u201d\n\u201cIt leads to thoughtfulness,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cIt is delicate. That should always be the concern when one is speaking. To be too much talking.\u201d He shook his head. Disapproval. \u201cIt is . . .\u201d He stalled, searching for a word.", "\u201cRude?\u201d\nNegation. Frustration. \u201cI go to Severen, and there are people who stink. There are people who do not. Both are people, but those who do not stink are people of quality.\u201d He tapped my chest firmly with two fingers. \u201cYou are not a goatherd. You are a student of the Lethani. My student. You should speak as a person of quality.\u201d\n\u201cBut what about clarity? What if you were building a bridge? There are many pieces to that. All of them must be said clearly.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Tempi said. Agreement. \u201cSometimes. But in most things, important things, delicate is better. Small is better.\u201d\nTempi reached out and gripped my shoulder firmly. Then he looked up, met my eye and held it for a brief moment. Such a rarity for him. He gave a small, quiet smile.\n\u201cProud,\u201d he said.\nThe remainder of the day was spent in recovery. We would walk a few miles, perform the Ketan, discuss the Lethani, then walk again. We stopped at a roadside inn that evening where I ate enough for three men and fell into bed before the sun had left the sky.\nThe next day we went back to the cycles, but only two before midday and two after. My body burned and ached, but I was no longer delirious with exhaustion. Fortunately, with a little mental effort, I could slide back into that strange anticipatory clear-headedness I\u2019d used to answer Tempi\u2019s questions the day before.\nOver the next couple of days I came to think of that odd mental state as Spinning Leaf.\nIt seemed like a distant cousin to Heart of Stone, the mental exercise I\u2019d learned so long ago. That said, there was little similarity between the two. Heart of Stone was practical: it stripped away emotion and focused my mind. It made it easier to break my mind into separate pieces or maintain the all- important Alar.\nOn the other hand, Spinning Leaf seemed largely useless. It was relaxing to let my mind grow clear and empty, then float and tumble lightly from one thing to the next. But aside from helping me draw answers to Tempi\u2019s\n \nquestions out of thin air, it seemed to have no practical value. It was the mental equivalent of a card trick.\nBy the eighth day on the road, my body no longer ached constantly. That was when Tempi added something new. After performing the Ketan the two of us would fight. It was hard, as that was when I was the most weary. But after the fighting we would always sit, rest, and discuss the Lethani.\n\u201cWhy did you smile as we fought today?\u201d Tempi would say. \u201cBecause I was happy.\u201d\n\u201cDid you enjoy the fighting?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nTempi radiated displeasure. \u201cThat is not of the Lethani.\u201d\nI thought a moment on my next question. \u201cShould a man take pleasure in the fight?\u201d\n\u201cNo. You take pleasure in acting rightly and following the Lethani.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if following the Lethani requires me to fight? Should I not take pleasure in it?\u201d\n\u201cNo.You should take pleasure in following the Lethani. If you fight well, you should take pride in doing a thing well. For the fighting itself you should feel only duty and sorrow. Only barbarians and madmen take pleasure in combat. Whoever loves the fight itself has left the Lethani behind.\u201d\nOn the eleventh day, Tempi showed me how to incorporate my sword into the Ketan. The first thing I learned was how quickly a sword becomes lead- heavy when held at arm\u2019s length.\nWith our sparring and the addition of the sword, each cycle took nearly two and a half hours. Still we kept to our schedule every day. Three cycles before noon, three cycles after. Fifteen hours in all. I could feel my body hardening, becoming quick and lean like Tempi\u2019s.\nSo we ran, and I learned, and Haert drew ever closer.\n \nCHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TEN\nBeauty and Branch\nAS WE TRAVELED, WE moved quickly through towns, stopping only for food and water. The countryside was a blur. My mind was focused on the Ketan, the Lethani, and the language I was learning.\nThe road became narrower as we made our way into the foothills of the Stormwal. The land grew rocky and jagged and the road began to snake back and forth as it avoided box valleys, bluffs, and jumbles of broken rock. The air changed, growing cooler than I expected in summer.\nWe finished the trip in fifteen days. At my best guess, we covered almost three hundred miles in that time.\nHaert was the first Adem town I\u2019d ever seen, and to my inexperienced eye it hardly seemed a town at all. There was no central street lined with houses and shops. What buildings I did see were widely spaced, oddly shaped, and built to fit closely with the natural shape of the land, as if they were trying to keep out of sight.\nI didn\u2019t know that the powerful storms that gave the mountain range its name were common here. Their sudden, changing winds would tear apart anything so upthrust and angular as the square timber houses common in the lands below.\nInstead the Adem built sensibly, hiding their buildings from the weather. Homes were built into the sides of hills, or outward from the leeward walls of sheltering cliffs. Some were dug downward. Others were carved into the stony sides of bluffs. Some you could hardly see unless you were standing next to them.\nThe exception was a group of low stone buildings clustered close together some distance from the road.\nWe stopped outside the largest of these. Tempi turned to face me, tugging nervously at the leather straps holding his mercenary reds tight to his arms. \u201cI must go and make my introductions to Shehyn. It may be some time.\u201d Anxiety. Regret. \u201cYou must wait here. Perhaps long.\u201d His body language told", "me more than his words. I cannot take you inside, as you are a barbarian. \u201cI will wait,\u201d I reassured him.\nHe nodded and went inside, glancing back at me before closing the door\nbehind himself.\nI looked around, watching a few people quietly going about their business:\na woman carrying a basket, a young boy leading a goat by a piece of rope. The buildings were made of the same rough stone as the landscape, blending into their surroundings. The sky was overcast, adding another shade of grey.\nThe wind blew over everything, snapping around corners and making patterns in the grass. I thought briefly of pulling on my shaed, but decided against it. The air was thinner here, and cooler. But it was still summer, and the sun was warm.\nIt felt oddly peaceful here, with none of the clamor and stink of a larger town. No clatter of hooves on cobblestones. No cart vendors singing out their wares. I could imagine someone like Tempi growing up in a place like this, soaking in the quiet until he was full of it, then taking it with him when he left.\nWith little else to look at, I turned to the nearby building. It was made from uneven pieces of stone pieced together like a jigsaw. Looking closer, I was puzzled by the lack of mortar. I tapped it with a knuckle, wondering briefly if it might be a single piece of stone carved to look like many stones fit together.\nBehind me, I heard a voice say in Ademic, \u201cWhat do you think of our wall?\u201d\nI turned to see an older woman with the characteristic pale grey eyes of the Adem. Her face was impassive, but her features were kind and motherly. She wore a yellow woolen cap pulled down over her ears. It was roughly knitted, and the sandy hair that stuck out from underneath was starting to go white. After all this time traveling with Tempi, it was odd to see an Adem who wasn\u2019t strapped into tight mercenary reds and wearing a sword. This woman wore a loose-fitting white shirt and linen pants.\n\u201cIs it fascinating, our wall?\u201d she asked, gesturing gentle amusement, curiosity with one hand. \u201cWhat do you think of it?\u201d\n\u201cI think it is beautiful,\u201d I responded in Ademic, careful to make only brief eye contact.\nHer hand tilted in an unfamiliar gesture. \u201cBeautiful?\u201d\nI gave the barest of shrugs. \u201cThere is beauty that belongs to simple things", "of function.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps you are mistaking a word,\u201d she said. Gentle apology. \u201cBeauty is a\nflower or a woman or a gem. Perhaps you mean to say \u2018utility.\u2019 A wall is useful.\u201d\n\u201cUseful, but beautiful as well.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps a thing gains beauty being used.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps a thing is used according to its beauty,\u201d I countered, wondering if\nthis was the Adem equivalent of small talk. If it was, I preferred it to the insipid gossip of the Maer\u2019s court.\n\u201cWhat of my hat?\u201d she asked, touching it with a hand. \u201cIs it beautiful because it is used?\u201d\nIt was knitted from a thick homespun wool and dyed a bright cornsilk yellow. It was slightly lopsided, and its stitching was uneven in places. \u201cIt seems very warm,\u201d I said carefully.\nShe gestured small amusement, and her eyes twinkled ever so slightly. \u201cIt is that,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd to me it is beautiful, as it was made for me by my daughter\u2019s daughter.\u201d\n\u201cThen it is beautiful as well.\u201d Agreement.\nThe woman hand-smiled at me. Her hand tilted differently than Tempi\u2019s when she made the gesture, and I decided to take it as a fond, motherly smile. Keeping my face blank, I gestured a smile in return, doing my best to make it both warm and polite.\n\u201cYou speak well for a barbarian,\u201d she said and reached out to grip my arms in a friendly gesture. \u201cVisitors are rare, especially those so courteous. Come with me and I will show you beauty, and you will speak to me of what its use might be.\u201d\nI looked down. Regret. \u201cI cannot. I am waiting.\u201d\n\u201cFor one inside?\u201d\nI nodded.\n\u201cIf they have gone inside, I suspect you will be waiting some time.\nCertainly they would be pleased if you came with me. I may prove more entertaining than a wall.\u201d The old woman lifted her arm and caught the attention of a young boy. He trotted over and looked up at her expectantly, his eyes darting briefly to my hair.\nShe made several gestures to the boy, but I only understood quietly. \u201cTell those inside I am taking this man for a walk so he need not stand alone in the wind. I will return him shortly.\u201d", "She tapped my lute case, then did the same to my travelsack and the sword on my hip. \u201cGive these to the boy and he will take them inside for you.\u201d\nWithout waiting for me to reply, she began to tug my travelsack off my shoulder, and I couldn\u2019t think of a graceful way of disengaging myself without seeming terribly impolite. Every culture is different, but one thing is always true: the surest way to give offense is to refuse the hospitality of your host.\nThe boy scurried off with my things and the old woman took my arm, leading me away. I resigned myself somewhat gratefully to her company, and we walked quietly until we came to a deep valley that opened suddenly in front of us. It was green, with a stream at the bottom, and sheltered from the persistent wind.\n\u201cWhat would you say of such a thing?\u201d she asked, gesturing to the hidden valley.\n\u201cIt is much like Ademre.\u201d\nShe patted my arm affectionately. \u201cYou have the gift of saying without saying. That is rare for one as you are.\u201d She began to make her way down into the valley, keeping one hand on my arm for support as she stepped carefully along a narrow rocky path that twisted along the valley wall. I spotted a young boy with a herd of sheep not too far off. He waved to us, but did not call out.\nWe made our way to the valley bottom where the stream rolled white over stones. It made clear pools where I could see the ripples of fish stirring in the water.\n\u201cWould you call this beautiful?\u201d she asked after we had looked a while. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nUncertainty. \u201cPerhaps its movement.\u201d\n\u201cThe stone moved not at all, and you called it beautiful as well.\u201d Questioning.\n\u201cIt is not the nature of stone to move. Perhaps it is beauty to move according to your nature.\u201d\nShe nodded as if my answer pleased her. We continued to watch the water. \u201cHave you heard of the Latantha?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Regret. \u201cBut perhaps I simply do not know the word.\u201d\nShe turned and we made our way along the valley floor until we came to a\nwider spot with the carefully groomed look of a garden. In the center of it", "was a tall tree the like of which I had never seen before.\nWe stopped at the edge of the clearing. \u201cThis is the sword tree,\u201d she said,\nand made a gesture I did not recognize, brushing the back of her hand against her cheek. \u201cThe Latantha. Would you say it is beautiful?\u201d\nI watched it for a moment. Curiosity.\u201cI would enjoy seeing it more closely.\u201d\n\u201cThat is not allowed.\u201d Emphatic.\nI nodded and watched it as well as I could from this distance. It had high, arching branches like an oak, but its leaves were broad, flat, and spun in odd circles when they caught the wind. \u201cYes.\u201d I answered after a long while.\n\u201cWhy did it take you so long to decide?\u201d\n\u201cI was considering the reason for its beauty,\u201d I admitted.\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\n\u201cI could say it both moves and doesn\u2019t move according to its nature, and\nthat grants it beauty. But I do not think that is the reason.\u201d\n\u201cWhy then?\u201d\nI watched it for a long time. \u201cI do not know. What do you consider the\nreason?\u201d\n\u201cIt simply is,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is enough.\u201d\nI nodded, feeling slightly foolish about the elaborate answers I had given\nbefore.\n\u201cDo you know of the Ketan?\u201d she asked, surprising me.\nI now had an inkling of how important such things were to the Adem. So I\nhesitated to give an open answer. However I did not want to lie either. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d Apology.\nShe nodded. \u201cYou are cautious.\u201d\n\u201cYes. Are you Shehyn?\u201d\nShehyn nodded. \u201cWhen did you suspect me of being who I am?\u201d \u201cWhen you asked of the Ketan,\u201d I said. \u201cWhen did you suspect me of\nknowing more than a barbarian should?\u201d\n\u201cWhen I saw you set your feet.\u201d\nAnother silence.\n\u201cShehyn, why do you not wear the red like other mercenaries?\u201d\nShe made a pair of unfamiliar gestures. \u201cHas your teacher told you why\nthey wear the red?\u201d\n\u201cI did not think to ask,\u201d I said, not wanting to imply Tempi had neglected\nmy training.", "\u201cI ask you then.\u201d\nI thought a moment. \u201cSo their enemies will not see them bleed?\u201d Approval. \u201cWhy then do I wear white?\u201d\nThe only answer I could think of chilled me. \u201cBecause you do not bleed.\u201d She gave a partial nod. \u201cAlso because if an enemy draws my blood, she\nshould see it as her fair reward.\u201d\nI fretted silently, doing my best to mimic proper Adem composure. After\nan appropriately polite pause, I asked. \u201cWhat will become of Tempi?\u201d\n\u201cThat remains to be seen.\u201d She gestured something close to irritation, then\nasked, \u201cAre you not concerned for yourself?\u201d\n\u201cI am more concerned for Tempi.\u201d\nThe sword tree spun patterns on the wind. It was almost hypnotic. \u201cHow far have you come in your training?\u201d Shehyn asked.\n\u201cI have studied the Ketan for a month.\u201d\nShe turned to face me and raised her hands. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d\nI could not help but think that she was shorter than me by six inches and\nold enough to be my grandmother. Her lopsided yellow hat didn\u2019t make her look terribly intimidating either. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d I said, and raised my hands as well.\nShehyn came toward me slowly, making Hands like Knives. I countered with Catching Rain. Then I made Climbing Iron and Fast Inward, but could not touch her. She quickened slightly, made Turning Breath and Striking Forward at the same time. I stopped one with Fan Water, but couldn\u2019t escape the other. She touched me below my ribs then on my temple, softly as you would press a finger to someone\u2019s lips.\nNothing I tried had any effect on her. I made Thrown Lighting, but she simply stepped away, not even bothering to counter. Once or twice I felt the brush of cloth against my hands as I came close enough to touch her white shirt, but that was all. It was like trying to strike a piece of hanging string.\nI set my teeth and made Threshing Wheat, Pressing Cider, and Mother at the Stream, moving seamlessly from one to the other in a flurry of blows.\nShe moved like nothing I had ever seen. It wasn\u2019t that she was fast, though she was fast, but that was not the heart of it. Shehyn moved perfectly, never taking two steps when one would do. Never moving four inches when she only needed three. She moved like something out of a story, more fluid and graceful than Felurian dancing.\nHoping to catch her by surprise and prove myself, I moved as fast as I", "dared. I made Maiden Dancing, Catching Sparrows, Fifteen Wolves . . . Shehyn took one single, perfect step.\n\u201cWhy do you weep?\u201d Shehyn asked as she made Heron Falling. \u201cAre you\nashamed? Are you in fear?\u201d\nI blinked my eyes to clear them. My voice was harsh from the exertion and\nemotion. \u201cYou are beautiful, Shehyn. For in you is the stone of the wall, the water of the stream, and the motion of the tree in one.\u201d\nShehyn blinked, and in her moment of surprise I found myself firmly gripping her shoulder and arm. I made Thunder Upward, but instead of being thrown, Shehyn stood still and solid as a stone.\nAlmost absentmindedly, she freed herself with Break Lion and made Threshing Wheat. I flew six feet and hit the ground.\nI was up quickly with no harm done. It was a gentle throw on soft turf, and Tempi had taught me how to fall without hurting myself. But before I could advance again Shehyn stopped me with a gesture.\n\u201cTempi has both taught you and not taught you,\u201d she said, her expression unreadable. I forced my eyes away from her face again. So hard to break that lifetime\u2019s worth of habit. \u201cWhich is both bad and good. Come.\u201d She turned and walked closer to the tree.\nIt was bigger than I had thought. The smaller branches moved in wild, curving patterns as the wind tossed them about.\nShehyn picked up a fallen leaf and handed it to me. It was broad and flat, the size of a small plate, and surprisingly heavy. My hand stung and I saw a thin line of blood trailing down my thumb.\nI examined the edge of the leaf and saw it was rigid, its edge as sharp as a blade of grass. Sword tree indeed. I looked up at the spinning leaves. Anyone standing near the tree when the wind was high would be cut to ribbons.\nShehyn said, \u201cIf you were to attack this tree, what would you do? Would you strike the root? No. Too strong. Would you strike the leaf? No. Too fast. Where then?\u201d\n\u201cThe branch.\u201d\n\u201cThe branch.\u201d Agreement. She turned to me. \u201cThat is what Tempi has not taught you. It would have been wrong for him to teach you that. Nevertheless, you have suffered for it.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\nShe gestured for me to begin the Ketan. Automatically I fell into Catch Sparrows.", "\u201cStop.\u201d I froze in position. \u201cIf I am to attack you, where should it be? Here, at the root?\u201d She pushed my leg and found it unyielding. \u201cHere at the leaf?\u201d She pushed at my upheld hand, moving it easily, but accomplishing little else. \u201cHere. The branch.\u201d She pushed gently against one of my shoulders, moving me easily. \u201cAnd here.\u201d She added pressure to my hip, spinning me around. \u201cDo you see? You find the place to spend your strength, or it is wasted. Wasting strength is not of the Lethani.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Shehyn.\u201d\nShe raised her hands, falling into the position where I had caught her before, midway through Heron Falling. \u201cMake Thunder Upward. Where is my root?\u201d\nI pointed to her solidly planted feet.\n\u201cWhere is the leaf?\u201d\nI pointed to her hands.\n\u201cNo. From here to here is the leaf.\u201d She indicated her whole arm and\ndemonstrated how she could freely strike with her hands, elbows or shoulders. \u201cWhere is the branch?\u201d\nI thought for a long moment, then tapped her knee.\nThough she gave no sign of it, I sensed her surprise. \u201cAnd?\u201d\nI tapped her opposite side under her armpit, then her shoulder. \u201cShow me.\u201d\nI came in close to her, set one leg close against her knee, and made\nThunder Upward, throwing her to the side. I was surprised at how little force was required.\nHowever, instead of being thrown into the air to tumble to the ground, Shehyn gripped my forearm. I felt a jolt run up my arm and was pulled one staggering step to the side. Rather than being thrown Shehyn used her grip as leverage so her feet came down beneath her. She took a single perfect step and had her balance again.\nShehyn looked me straight in the eye for a long, speculative moment, then turned to leave, gesturing for me to follow.", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN\nA Liar and a Thief\nSHEHYN AND I RETURNED to the complex of stone buildings to find Tempi standing outside, shifting nervously from foot to foot. That confirmed my suspicion. He hadn\u2019t sent Shehyn to test me. She had found me on her own.\nWhen we came close enough, Tempi held his sword out in his right hand, point down. His left hand gestured elaborate respect. \u201cShehyn,\u201d he said, \u201cI \u2014\u201d\nShehyn motioned for him to follow as she entered the low stone building. She motioned to a young boy. \u201cFetch Carceret.\u201d The boy took off running.\nCuriosity. I gestured to Tempi.\nHe didn\u2019t look at me. Profound seriousness. Attend. It didn\u2019t reassure me that these were the same gestures he had made on the road to Crosson when he thought we were walking into an ambush. His hands, I noticed, were shaking slightly.\nShehyn led us to an open doorway where a woman in mercenary reds joined us. I recognized the thin scars on her eyebrow and jaw. This was Carceret, the mercenary we had met while heading to Severen, the one who had pushed me.\nShehyn motioned the two mercenaries inside, but held up a hand to me. \u201cWait here. What Tempi has done is not good. I will listen. Then I will decide what is to be done with you.\u201d\nI nodded, and she closed the door behind her.\nI waited for an hour, then two. I strained my ears, but I couldn\u2019t hear anything from the other side of the door. A few people walked past in the hallway: two in mercenary reds, and another in simple grey homespun. Each\n \nof them looked at my hair, though none of them stared.\nInstead of smiling and nodding as would have been sociable among\nbarbarians, I kept my face blank, returned their small gestures of greeting, and avoided touching eyes.\nSomewhere past the third hour, the door opened and Shehyn waved me inside.\nIt was a well-lit room with walls of finished stone. It was the size of a large bedroom at an inn, but seemed even larger due to the lack of any significant furniture. There was a small iron stove radiating gentle heat near one wall, and four chairs facing each other in a rough circle. Tempi, Shehyn, and Carceret filled three of them. At a gesture from Shehyn, I took the fourth.\n\u201cHow many have you killed?\u201d Shehyn asked. Her tone was different than before. Peremptory. It was the same tone Tempi used during our discussions of the Lethani.\n\u201cMany.\u201d I responded without any hesitation. I might be thick at times, but I know when I\u2019m being tested.\n\u201cHow many is many?\u201d Not a request for clarification. It was a new question.\n\u201cIn killing men, one is many.\u201d\nShe nodded slightly. \u201cHave you killed men outside of the Lethani?\u201d \u201cPerhaps.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you not say yes or no?\u201d\n\u201cBecause the Lethani has not always been clear to me.\u201d\n\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d\n\u201cBecause the Lethani is not always clear.\u201d\n\u201cWhat makes the Lethani clear?\u201d\nI hesitated, though I knew it wasn\u2019t the right thing to do. \u201cThe words of a\nteacher.\u201d\n\u201cCan one teach the Lethani?\u201d\nI began to gesture uncertainty, then remembered hand-talk wasn\u2019t\nappropriate. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d I said. \u201cI cannot.\u201d\nTempi shifted slightly in his chair. This wasn\u2019t going well. For lack of any\nother ideas, I took a deep breath, relaxed, and tipped my mind gently into Spinning Leaf.\n\u201cWho knows the Lethani?\u201d Shehyn asked.\n\u201cThe windblown leaf,\u201d I responded, though I cannot honestly say what I meant by it.", "\u201cWhere does the Lethani come from?\u201d\n\u201cThe same place as laughing.\u201d\nShehyn hesitated slightly, then said, \u201cHow do you follow the Lethani?\u201d \u201cHow do you follow the moon?\u201d\nMy time with Tempi had taught me to appreciate the different sorts of\npauses that can punctuate a conversation. Ademic is a language that says as much with silence as with words. There is a pregnant pause. A polite pause. A confused pause. There is a pause that implies much, a pause that apologizes, a pause that adds emphasis....\nThis pause was a sudden gape in the conversation. It was the empty space of an indrawn breath. I sensed I had said something very clever or something very stupid.\nShehyn shifted in her seat, and the air of formality evaporated. Sensing we were moving on, I let my mind settle out of Spinning Leaf.\nShehyn turned to look at Carceret. \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d\nCarceret had sat like a statue through all of this, expressionless and still. \u201cI say as I have said before. Tempi has netinad us all. He should be cut away. This is the reason we have laws. To ignore a law is to erase it.\u201d\n\u201cTo blindly follow law is to be a slave,\u201d Tempi said quickly.\nShehyn gestured sharp rebuke, and Tempi flushed with embarrassment. \u201cAs for this.\u201d Carceret gestured at me. Dismissal. \u201cHe is not of Ademre. At\nbest he is a fool. At worst a liar and a thief.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what he said today?\u201d Shehyn asked.\n\u201cA dog can bark three times without counting.\u201d\nShehyn turned to Tempi. \u201cBy speaking out of turn you refuse your turn to\nspeak.\u201d Tempi flushed again, his lips growing pale as he struggled to maintain his composure.\nShehyn drew a deep breath and let it out slowly. \u201cThe Ketan and the Lethani are what make us Ademre,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no way a barbarian can know of the Ketan.\u201d Both Tempi and Carceret stirred, but she held up a hand. \u201cAt the same time, to destroy one who has understanding of the Lethani is not correct. The Lethani does not destroy itself.\u201d\nShe said \u201cdestroy\u201d very casually. I hoped I might be mistaken as to the true meaning of the Ademic word.\nShehyn continued. \u201cThere are those who might say, \u2018This one has enough. Do not teach him the Lethani, because whoever has knowledge of the Lethani overcomes all things.\u2019 \u201d", "Shehyn gave a severe look to Carceret. \u201cBut I am not one who would say that. I think the world would be better if more were of the Lethani. For while it brings power, the Lethani also brings wisdom in the use of power.\u201d\nThere was a long pause. My stomach knotted itself as I tried to maintain a calm appearance. \u201cI think,\u201d Shehyn said at last, \u201cit is possible Tempi did not make a mistake.\u201d\nThis seemed a long way from a ringing endorsement, but from the sudden stiffness in Carceret\u2019s back and Tempi\u2019s slow, relieved exhalation, I guessed it was the news we were hoping for.\n\u201cI will give him to Vashet,\u201d Shehyn said.\nTempi went motionless. Carceret made a gesture of approval wide as a madman\u2019s smile.\nTempi\u2019s voice was strained. \u201cYou will give him to the Hammer?\u201d His hand flickered. Respect. Negation. Respect.\nShehyn got to her feet, signaling an end to the discussion. \u201cWho better? The Hammer will show if he is iron worth striking.\u201d\nWith this, Shehyn pulled Tempi aside and spoke to him for a brief moment. Her hands brushed his arms lightly. Her voice was too soft for even my finely tuned eavesdropper\u2019s ears.\nI stood politely near my chair. All the fight seemed to have left Tempi, and his gestures were a steady rhythm of agreement and respect.\nCarceret stood apart from them as well, staring at me. Her expression was composed, but her eyes were angry. At her side, out of sight of the other two, she made several small gestures. The only one I understood was disgust, but I could guess the general meaning of the others.\nIn return, I made a gesture that was not Ademic. By the narrowing of her eyes, I suspected she managed to glean my meaning fairly well.\nThere was the high sound of a bell ringing three times. A moment later, Tempi kissed Shehyn\u2019s hands, the peak of her forehead, and her mouth. Then he turned and motioned for me to follow.\nTogether we walked to a large, low-ceilinged room filled with people and the smell of food. It was a dining hall, full of long tables and dark wooden benches worn smooth with time.\nI followed Tempi, gathering food onto a wide wooden plate. Only then did I realize how terribly hungry I was.\nDespite my expectations, this dining hall didn\u2019t resemble the Mess at the University in the least. It was quieter for one thing, and the food was far", "better. There was fresh milk and lean tender meat that I suspected was goat. There was hard, sharp cheese and soft, creamy cheese and two kinds of bread still warm from the oven. There were apples and strawberries for the taking. Saltboxes sat open on all the tables, and everyone could take as much as they liked.\nIt was strange being in a room full of Adem talking. They spoke so softly I couldn\u2019t make out any words, but I could see their hands flickering. I could only understand one gesture in ten, but it was odd being able to see all the flickering emotions around me: Amusement. Anger. Embarrassment. Negation. Disgust. I wondered how much of it was about me, the barbarian among them.\nThere were more women than I\u2019d expected, and more young children. There were a handful of the familiar blood-red mercenaries, but more wore the simple grey I\u2019d seen during my walk with Shehyn. I saw a white shirt as well, and was surprised to see it was Shehyn herself, eating elbow to elbow with the rest of us.\nNone of them stared at me, but they were looking. A lot of attention was being paid to my hair, which was understandable. There were fifty sandy heads in the room, a few darker, a few lighter or grey with age. I stood out like a single burning candle.\nI tried to draw Tempi into a conversation, but he would have none of it and focused on his food instead. He hadn\u2019t loaded his plate nearly as full as mine and ate only a fraction of what he took.\nWith no conversation to slow things, I finished quickly. When my plate was empty, Tempi quit pretending to eat and led us away. I could feel dozens of eyes on my back as we left the room.\nHe took me down a series of passages until we came to a door. Tempi opened it, revealing a small room with a window and a bed. My lute and travelsack were there. My sword was not.\n\u201cYou are to have another teacher,\u201d Tempi spoke at last. \u201cDo your best. Be civilized. Your teacher will decide much.\u201d Regret. \u201cYou will not see me.\u201d\nHe was obviously troubled, but I couldn\u2019t think of anything to say that might reassure him. Instead I gave him a comforting hug, which he seemed to appreciate. Then he turned and left without another word.\nInside my room, I undressed and lay on the bed. It seems like I should say I tossed and turned, nervous about what was to come. But the simple truth is that I was exhausted and slept like a happy baby at his mother\u2019s breast.", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWELVE\nThe Hammer\nI SAT IN A TINY park composed of nothing more than two smooth stone benches, a handful of trees, and a small path running through the long grass. You could walk from one edge to the other in a minute. There were cliffs close on two sides, sheltering it from the wind. Not out of the wind, mind you. There didn\u2019t seem to be anywhere in all of Haert entirely out of the wind.\nAs Vashet approached, the first thing I noticed was that she didn\u2019t wear her sword on her hip. Instead she slung it over her shoulder, just as I carried my lute. She walked with the most subtle, solid confidence I have ever seen, as if she knew she ought to swagger, but couldn\u2019t quite be bothered.\nShe had the same moderate build I\u2019d come to expect from the Adem along with the pale, creamy complexion and grey eyes. Her hair was lighter than Tempi\u2019s by a fine shade, and she wore it pulled back into a horsetail. When she came closer, I could see her nose had been broken at some point, and while it wasn\u2019t crooked, the slight crimp looked strangely incongruous on her otherwise delicate face.\nVashet smiled at me, a wide pink smile that showed her white teeth. \u201cSo,\u201d she said in flawless Aturan. \u201cYou are mine now.\u201d\n\u201cYou speak Aturan,\u201d I said stupidly.\n\u201cMost of us do,\u201d she said. There were a few lines around the mouth and the corners of her eyes, so I guessed she was perhaps ten years older than me. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to make your way in the world if you don\u2019t have a good grip on the language. Hard to do business.\u201d\nI remembered myself too late. Formal. Respect. \u201cAm I correct in assuming you are Vashet?\u201d\nThe smile tugged back onto her mouth. Vashet returned my gesture broadly, exaggerating it so I couldn\u2019t help but feel I was being mocked. \u201cI am. I am to be your teacher.\u201d\n\u201cWhat of Shehyn? I understood she was the teacher here.\u201d", "Vashet arched an eyebrow at me, the extravagant expression startling on an Adem face. \u201cIn a general sense that is true. But in a more practical sense, Shehyn is far too important to be spending her time with someone like you.\u201d\nI gestured, polite. \u201cI was quite happy with Tempi,\u201d I said.\n\u201cAnd if your happiness were our goal, that might matter,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, Tempi is closer to being a sailboat than a teacher.\u201d\nI bristled a little at that. \u201cHe is my friend, you realize.\u201d\nHer eyes narrowed. \u201cThen as his friend you may fail to realize his faults. He is a competent fighter, but no more than that. He barely speaks your language, has little experience with the real world, and, to be completely frank, he is not terribly bright.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. Regret. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to offend you.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t show me humility unless you mean it,\u201d she said, still looking me over with narrow eyes. \u201cEven when you make your face a mask, your eyes are like glittering windows.\u201d\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d I said earnestly. Apology. \u201cI\u2019d hoped to make a good first impression.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cI would rather you thought well of me.\u201d\n\u201cI would rather have reason to think well of you.\u201d\nI decided to take another tack, hoping to steer the conversation into safer\nwater. \u201cTempi called you the Hammer. Why is that?\u201d\n\u201cThat is my name. Vashet. The Hammer. The Clay. The Spinning Wheel.\u201d\nShe pronounced her name three separate ways, each with its own cadence. \u201cI am that which shapes and sharpens, or destroys.\u201d\n\u201cWhy the clay?\u201d\n\u201cThat is also what I am,\u201d Vashet said. \u201cOnly that which bends can teach.\u201d I felt a growing excitement as she spoke, \u201cI will admit,\u201d I said. \u201cIt will be\npleasant to share a language with my teacher. There are a thousand questions I have not asked because I knew Tempi could not understand. Or even if he did, I wouldn\u2019t be able to make sense of his answers.\u201d\nVashet nodded and sat down on one of the benches. \u201cKnowing how to communicate is also the way of a teacher,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, go find a long piece of wood and bring it back to me. Then we will begin the lesson.\u201d\nI headed off into the trees. Her request had a ritual air about it, so I didn\u2019t want to run back with any odd branch I found on the ground. Eventually I found a willow tree and snapped off a supple branch longer than my arm and", "big around as my little finger.\nI returned to where Vashet sat on the bench. I handed her the willow\nbranch, and she pulled her sword over her shoulder and began to trim the smaller nubs of the remaining branches away.\n\u201cYou said only that which bends can teach,\u201d I said. \u201cSo I thought this would be appropriate.\u201d\n\u201cIt will serve for today\u2019s lesson,\u201d she said as she stripped the last of the bark away, leaving nothing but a slender white rod. She wiped her sword on her shirt, sheathed it, and came to her feet.\nHolding the willow branch in one hand, Vashet swung it back and forth, making a low whop whop noise as it skimmed through the air.\nNow that she was closer to me, I noticed that while Vashet wore the familiar mercenary reds, unlike Tempi and many of the others, her clothes weren\u2019t held tight with leather straps. Her shirt and pants were bound snugly to her arms and legs and chest by bands of blood-red silk instead.\nShe met my eye. \u201cI am going to hit you now,\u201d she said seriously. \u201cStand still.\u201d\nVashet began to walk around me in a slow circle, still swinging the willow rod. Whop whop. She moved behind me, and not being able to see her was worse. Whop whop. She swung the rod faster and the noise changed. Viiiip. Viiiip. I didn\u2019t flinch.\nShe circled again, moved behind me, then hit me twice. Once on each arm just below the shoulder. Viiiip. Viiiip. At first it merely felt like she\u2019d tapped me, then pain blossomed across my arms, blazing like fire.\nThen, before I could react, she struck me across the back so hard I felt the impact in my teeth. The only reason the rod didn\u2019t break is because it was supple green willow.\nI didn\u2019t cry out, but only because she had caught me between breaths. I gasped though, sucking in air so quickly I choked and coughed. My back screamed with pain as if it had been set afire.\nShe came around to the front of me again, giving me that same serious look. \u201cHere is your lesson,\u201d she said matter-of-factly. \u201cI do not think well of you. You are a barbarian. You are not clever. You are not welcome. You do not belong here. You are a thief of our secrets. Your presence is an embarrassment and a complication this school does not need.\u201d\nVashet contemplated the end of the willow rod, then turned her eyes back to me. \u201cWe will meet here again, an hour after lunch. You will pick another", "stick, and I will try to teach you this lesson again.\u201d She gave me a pointed look. \u201cIf the stick you bring me does not please me, I will choose my own.\n\u201cWe will do the same after dinner. Then the same the next day. This is the only lesson I have to teach you. When you learn it, you will leave Haert and never return.\u201d She looked at me, her face cool. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d\n\u201cWhat will\u2014\u201d Her hand flicked out, and the tip of the rod caught me on the cheek. This time I had the breath for it, and I gave a high, startled yelp.\nVashet looked at me. I\u2019d never thought anything so simple as eye contact could be so intimidating. But her pale grey eyes were hard as ice. \u201cSay to me, \u2018Yes, Vashet. I understand.\u2019 \u201d\nI glared. \u201cYes, Vashet. I understand.\u201d The right side of my upper lip felt huge and unwieldy as I spoke.\nShe searched my face, as if trying to decide something, then shrugged and tossed the stick aside.\nOnly then did I risk speaking again. \u201cWhat would happen to Tempi if I were to leave?\u201d\n\u201cWhen you leave,\u201d she said, stressing the first word. \u201cThe few that doubt it will know he was wrong to teach you. Doubly wrong to bring you here.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what will . . .\u201d I paused and backtracked. \u201cWhat would become of him in that case?\u201d\nShe shrugged and turned away. \u201cThat is not for me to decide,\u201d she said, and walked away.\nI touched my cheek and lip, then looked at my hand. No blood, but I could feel the red welt rising on my skin, plain as a brand for anyone to see.\nNot sure what else I should do, I returned to the school for lunch. After making my way to the dining hall, I looked around but didn\u2019t see Tempi among the blood-red mercenaries there. I was glad for that. As much as I would have enjoyed some friendly company, I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of him knowing how badly things had gone. I wouldn\u2019t even need to tell him. The mark on my face said it plainly for everyone in the room to see.\nI kept my face impassive and my eyes low as I moved through the line and filled my plate. Then I chose an empty section of table, not wanting to force my company on anyone.\n \nI have been alone for most of my life. But rarely have I felt it so much as at that moment. I knew one person within four hundred miles, and he\u2019d been ordered to keep away from me. I was unfamiliar with the culture, barely competent with the language, and the burning all across my back and face was a constant reminder of how much I was unwelcome.\nThe food was good though. Roasted chicken, crisp longbeans, and a slice of sweet molasses pudding. Better fare than I could usually afford for myself at the University, and hotter than the food at the Maer\u2019s estate. I wasn\u2019t particularly hungry, but I\u2019ve been hungry enough in my life that I have a hard time walking away from an easy meal.\nThere was a shadow of movement on the edge of my vision as someone sat down across the table from me. I felt my mood lighten. At least one person was brave enough to visit the barbarian. Someone was kind enough to comfort me, or at least curious enough to come and talk.\nLifting my head I saw Carceret\u2019s lean, scarred face. She set her wide wooden plate down across from me.\n\u201cHow do you like our town?\u201d she said quietly, her left hand resting on the surface of the table. Her gestures were different, as we were sitting, but I could still recognize curious and polite. To anyone watching, it would seem like we were having a pleasant conversation. \u201cHow do you like your new teacher? She thinks as I think. That you do not belong.\u201d\nI chewed another mouthful of chicken and swallowed mechanically, not looking up.\nConcern. \u201cI heard you cry out,\u201d she continued softly. She spoke slower now, as if talking to a child. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was meant as an insult, or to ensure I understood her. \u201cIt was like a tiny bird.\u201d\nI took a drink of warm goat\u2019s milk and wiped my mouth. The motion of my arm pulled my shirt across the welt on my back, stinging like a hundred wasps.\n\u201cWas it a cry of love?\u201d she asked, making a gesture I didn\u2019t recognize. \u201cDid Vashet embrace you? Does your cheek bear the mark of her tongue?\u201d\nI took a bit of pudding. It wasn\u2019t as sweet as I remembered.\nCarceret took a bite of her own pudding. \u201cEveryone gambles on when you will leave,\u201d she continued, still speaking slow and low, for my ears only. \u201cI have two talents wagered that you will not last a second day. If you leave in the night, as I hope, I win silver. If I am wrong and you stay, I win in bruises and listening to your cries.\u201d Entreaty. \u201cStay.\u201d", "I looked up at her. \u201cYou speak as a dog barks,\u201d I said. \u201cWith no end. With no sense.\u201d\nI spoke quietly enough to be polite. But not so quietly that my voice didn\u2019t reach the ears of everyone sitting close to us. I know how to make a soft voice carry. We Ruh invented the stage whisper.\nI saw her face flush, making the pale scars on her jaw and eyebrow stand out.\nI looked down and continued to eat, the very picture of calm unconcern. It\u2019s tricky, insulting someone from a different culture. But I\u2019d chosen my words carefully, based on things I\u2019d heard Tempi say. If she responded in any way, it would only seem to prove my point.\nI finished the rest of my meal slowly and methodically, imagining I could feel the rage rolling off her like waves of heat. This small battle, at least, I could win. It was a hollow victory, of course. But sometimes you have to take what you can get.\nWhen Vashet returned to the small park, I was already sitting on one of the stone benches, waiting for her.\nShe stood before me and sighed gustily. \u201cLovely. A slow learner,\u201d she said in her perfect Aturan. \u201cGo fetch your stick then. We\u2019ll see if I can make my point more clearly this time.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve already found my stick,\u201d I said. I reached behind the bench and brought out a wooden training sword I\u2019d borrowed from the school.\nIt was old, oiled wood, worn smooth by countless hands, hard and heavy as a bar of iron. If she used this to strike my shoulders as she had with the willow rod, it would break bones. If she struck my face, it would shatter my jaw.\nI set it on the bench beside me. The wood didn\u2019t clatter against the stone. It was so hard it almost rang like a bell.\nAfter I set down the training sword, I began to pull my shirt up over my head, sucking a breath through my teeth when it dragged against the hot welt on my back.\n\u201cAre you hoping to sway me with the offer of your tender young body?\u201d Vashet asked. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty, but not so pretty as that.\u201d\n \nI laid my shirt carefully on the bench. \u201cI just thought it would be best if I showed you something.\u201d I turned so she could see my back.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been whipped,\u201d she said. \u201cI cannot say I\u2019m surprised. I already knew you to be a thief.\u201d\n\u201cThese are not from thieving,\u201d I said. \u201cThese are from the University. I was brought up on charges and sentenced to be whipped. When this happens, many students simply leave and take their education elsewhere. I decided to stay. It was only three lashes, after all.\u201d\nI waited, still facing away. After a moment she took the bait. \u201cThere are more scars here than three lashes can account for.\u201d\n\u201cSome time after that,\u201d I said, \u201cI was brought up on charges again. Six lashes this time. Still I stayed.\u201d I turned back to face her. \u201cI stayed because there was no other place I could learn what I desired. Mere whipping could not keep me away from it.\u201d\nI picked up the heavy wooden sword from the bench. \u201cI thought it only fair that you should know this. I cannot be frightened away with the threat of pain. I will not abandon Tempi after the trust he has shown me. There are things I desire to learn, and I can only learn them here.\u201d\nI handed her the hard, dark piece of wood. \u201cIf you want me to leave, you must do worse than welts.\u201d\nI stepped back and let my hands hang at my sides. I closed my eyes.", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTEEN\nBarbarian Tongue\nI\u2019D LIKE TO SAY I kept my eyes closed, but that wouldn\u2019t be the truth. I heard the gritty sound of dirt beneath the soles of Vashet\u2019s shoes and couldn\u2019t help but open them.\nI didn\u2019t peek. That would only make me seem childish. I simply opened my eyes and looked at her. She stared back, making more eye contact than I would get from Tempi in a span of days. Her pale grey eyes were hard in her delicate face. Her broken nose no longer looked out of place. It was a grim warning to the world.\nThe wind swirled between us, raising gooseflesh on my naked arms.\nVashet drew a resigned breath and shrugged, then flipped the wooden rod to grip the handle end. She hefted it thoughtfully with both hands, getting a feel for its weight. Then she brought it up to her shoulder and swung.\nExcept she didn\u2019t.\n\u201cFine!\u201d she said, exasperated, throwing up her hands. \u201cYou twiggy little skeeth. Fine! Shit and onions. Put your shirt back on. You\u2019re making me cold.\u201d\nI sank down until I was sitting on the bench. \u201cThank God,\u201d I said. I started to put my shirt back on, but it was difficult, as my hands were shaking. It wasn\u2019t from the cold.\nVashet saw. \u201cI knew it!\u201d she said triumphantly, pointing a finger at me. \u201cYou standing there like you\u2019re ready to be hanged. I knew you were ready to run like a rabbit!\u201d She stamped her foot in frustration. \u201cI knew I should have taken a swing at you!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t,\u201d I said. I managed to get my shirt on, then realized it was inside out. I decided to leave it rather than drag it across my stinging back again.\n\u201cWhat gave me away?\u201d she demanded.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d I said. \u201cIt was a masterful performance.\u201d\n\u201cThen how\u2019d you know I wasn\u2019t going to crack your skull open?\u201d", "\u201cI thought it through,\u201d I said. \u201cIf Shehyn had really wanted me driven off, she could have just sent me packing. If she wanted me dead, she could have done that too.\u201d\nI rubbed my sweaty hands on my pants. \u201cThat meant you were really meant to be my teacher. So there were only three sensible options.\u201d I held up a finger. \u201cThis was a ritual initiation.\u201d A second finger. \u201cIt was test of my resolve . . .\u201d\n\u201cOr I was really trying to run you off,\u201d Vashet finished as she sat on the bench opposite me. \u201cWhat if I\u2019d been telling the truth and thumped you bloody?\u201d\nI shrugged. \u201cAt least I\u2019d have known. But it seemed like long odds that Shehyn would choose someone like that. If she\u2019d wanted me beaten she could have let Carceret do it.\u201d I cocked my head. \u201cOut of curiosity, which was it? Initiation or test of resolve? Does everyone go through this?\u201d\nShe shook her head. \u201cResolve. I needed to make sure of you. I wasn\u2019t going to waste my time teaching a coward or someone afraid of a little smack or two. I also needed to know you were dedicated.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cThat seemed the most likely. I thought I\u2019d save myself several days of welts and force the issue.\u201d\nVashet gave me a long look, curiosity plain on her face. \u201cI will admit, I\u2019ve never had a student offer himself up for a vicious beating in order to prove he\u2019s worth my time.\u201d\n\u201cThis was nothing,\u201d I said nonchalantly. \u201cOnce I jumped off a roof.\u201d\nWe spent an hour talking about small things, letting the tension between us slowly bleed away. She asked how exactly I\u2019d come to be whipped, and I gave her the bones of the story, glad to have the chance to explain myself. I didn\u2019t want her thinking of me as a criminal.\nVashet examined my scars more closely afterward. \u201cWhoever tended to you certainly knew their physic,\u201d she said admiringly. \u201cThis is very clean work. As good as any I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll pass along your compliments,\u201d I said.\nHer hand brushed gently along the edge of the hot welt that ran across the whole length of my back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for this, by the way.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt hurts worse than the whipping ever did, I\u2019ll tell you that for free.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be gone in a day or two,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich isn\u2019t to say you won\u2019t be sleeping on your stomach tonight.\u201d She helped me settle my shirt, then moved back to the other bench, facing me.\nI hesitated before saying, \u201cNo offense, Vashet. But you seem different from the other Adem I\u2019ve met. Not that I\u2019ve met many, mind you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re just hungry for familiar body language,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThere is that,\u201d I said. \u201cBut you seem more . . . expressive than the other Adem I\u2019ve seen.\u201d I pointed at my face.\nVashet shrugged. \u201cWhere I\u2019m from, we grow up speaking your language. And I spent four years as bodyguard and captain for a poet in the Small Kingdoms who also happened to be a king. I probably speak Aturan better than anyone in Haert. Including you.\u201d\nI ignored the last. \u201cYou didn\u2019t grow up here?\u201d\nShe shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m from Feant, a town farther north. We\u2019re more . . . cosmopolitan. Haert only has the one school, and everyone is tied very tightly to it. The sword tree is one of the old paths, too. Rather formal. I grew up following the path of joy.\u201d\n\u201cThere are other schools?\u201d\nVashet nodded. \u201cThis is one of the many schools that follow the Latantha, the path of the sword tree. It\u2019s one of the oldest, behind the Aethe and Aratan. There are other paths, maybe three dozen. But some of those are very small, with only one or two schools teaching their Ketan.\u201d\n\u201cIs that why your sword is different?\u201d I asked. \u201cDid you bring it from your other school?\u201d\nVashet gave me a narrow look. \u201cWhat do you know of my sword?\u201d\n\u201cYou brought it out to trim the willow switch,\u201d I said. \u201cTempi\u2019s sword was well-made, but yours is different. The handle is worn, but the blade looks new.\u201d\nShe gave me a curious look. \u201cWell you certainly have your eyes open, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nI shrugged.\n\u201cStrictly speaking, it\u2019s not my sword,\u201d Vashet said. \u201cIt\u2019s merely in my keeping. It is an old sword, and the blade is the oldest part of it. It was given to me by Shehyn herself.\u201d\n\u201cIs that why you came to this school?\u201d\nVashet shook her head. \u201cNo. Shehyn gave me the sword much later.\u201d She", "reached back and touched the hilt fondly. \u201cNo. I came here because while the Latantha might be rather formal, they excel in the use of the sword. I had learned as much as I could from the path of joy. Three other schools refused me before Shehyn brought me in. She is a clever woman and realized there was something to be gained in teaching me.\u201d\n\u201cI guess we\u2019re both lucky she has an open mind,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou more than me,\u201d Vashet said. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain amount of one- upsmanship among the different paths. When I joined the Latantha, it was a bit of a feather in Shehyn\u2019s cap.\u201d\n\u201cIt must have been hard,\u201d I said. \u201cComing here and being the stranger to everyone.\u201d\nVashet shrugged, making her sword rise and fall on her shoulder. \u201cAt first,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut they recognize talent, and I have that to spare. Among those who study the path of joy, I was viewed as rather stiff and stodgy. But here I\u2019m seen as somewhat wild.\u201d She grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s pleasant, like having a new set of clothes to wear.\u201d\n\u201cDoes the path of joy also teach the Lethani?\u201d I asked.\nVashet laughed. \u201cThat is a matter of some considerable debate. The simple answer is yes. All Adem study the Lethani to some degree. Those in the schools especially. That said, the Lethani is open to a broad interpretation. What some schools cling to, others spurn.\u201d\nShe gave me a thoughtful look. \u201cIs it true you said the Lethani comes from the same place as laughing?\u201d\nI nodded.\n\u201cThat is a good answer,\u201d she said. \u201cMy teacher in the path of joy once said that very thing to me.\u201d Vashet frowned. \u201cYou look pensive when I say that. Why?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d tell you,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want you to think less of me.\u201d\n\u201cI think less of you for keeping something from your teacher,\u201d she said seriously. \u201cThere must be trust between us.\u201d\nI sighed. \u201cI am glad you like my answer. But honestly, I don\u2019t know what it means.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you what it means,\u201d she said easily.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a nonsense answer,\u201d I said. \u201cI know you all place great stock in the Lethani, but I don\u2019t really understand it. I\u2019ve just found a way to fake it.\u201d\nVashet smiled indulgently. \u201cThere is no pretending to understand the Lethani,\u201d she said confidently. \u201cIt is like swimming. It is obvious to anyone", "watching if you really know the way of it.\u201d\n\u201cA person can pretend to swim too,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cI\u2019ve simply been\nmoving my arms and walking on the bottom of the river.\u201d\nShe gave me a curious look. \u201cVery well then. How have you managed to\nfool us?\u201d\nI explained Spinning Leaf to her. How I had learned to tip my thoughts\ninto a light, empty, floating place where the answers to their questions came easily.\n\u201cSo you have stolen the answers from yourself,\u201d she said with mock seriousness. \u201cYou have cleverly fooled us by pulling the answers from your own mind.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d I said, growing irritated. \u201cI don\u2019t have the slightest idea what the Lethani really is! It\u2019s not a path, but it helps choose a path. It\u2019s the simplest way, but it is not easy to see. Honestly, you people sound like drunk cartographers.\u201d\nI regretted saying it as soon as it was out of my mouth, but Vashet merely laughed. \u201cThere are many drunks who are quite conversant with the Lethani,\u201d she said. \u201cSeveral legendarily so.\u201d\nSeeing I was still agitated, she made a motion to calm me. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the Lethani either, not in a way that can be explained to another. The teaching of the Lethani is an art I do not possess. If Tempi has managed to instill the Lethani in you, it is a great mark in his favor.\u201d\nVashet leaned forward seriously. \u201cPart of the problem is with your language,\u201d she said. \u201cAturan is very explicit. It is very precise and direct. Our language is rich with implication, so it is easier for us to accept the existence of things that cannot be explained. The Lethani is the greatest of these.\u201d\n\u201cCan you give me an example of one other than the Lethani?\u201d I asked. \u201cAnd please don\u2019t say \u2018blue,\u2019 or I might go absolutely mad right here on this bench.\u201d\nShe thought for a moment. \u201cLove is such a thing.You have knowledge of what it is, but it defies careful explication.\u201d\n\u201cLove is a subtle concept,\u201d I admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s elusive, like justice, but it can be defined.\u201d\nHer eyes sparkled. \u201cDo so then, my clever student. Tell me of love.\u201d\nI thought for a quick moment, then for a long moment.\nVashet grinned. \u201cYou see how easy it will be for me to pick holes in any\ndefinition you give.\u201d", "\u201cLove is the willingness to do anything for someone,\u201d I said. \u201cEven at detriment to yourself.\u201d\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d she said. \u201cHow is love different from duty or loyalty?\u201d \u201cIt is also combined with a physical attraction,\u201d I said.\n\u201cEven a mother\u2019s love?\u201d Vashet asked.\n\u201cCombined with an extreme fondness then,\u201d I amended.\n\u201cAnd what exactly do you mean by \u2018fondness\u2019?\u201d she asked with a maddening calm.\n\u201cIt is . . .\u201d I trailed off, racking my brain to think how I could describe love without resorting to other, equally abstract terms.\n\u201cThis is the nature of love.\u201d Vashet said. \u201cTo attempt to describe it will drive a woman mad. That is what keeps poets scribbling endlessly away. If one could pin it to the paper all complete, the others would lay down their pens. But it cannot be done.\u201d\nShe held up a finger. \u201cBut only a fool claims there is no such thing as love. When you see two young ones staring at each other with dewy eyes, there it is. So thick you can spread it on your bread and eat it. When you see a mother with her child, you see love. When you feel it roil in your belly, you know what it is. Even if you cannot give voice to it in words.\u201d\nVashet made a triumphant gesture. \u201cThus also is the Lethani. But as it is greater, it is more difficult to point toward. That is the purpose of the questions. Asking them is like asking a young girl about the boy she fancies. Her answers may not use the word, but they reveal love or the lack of it within her heart.\u201d\n\u201cHow can my answers reveal a knowledge of the Lethani when I don\u2019t truly know what it is?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cYou obviously understand the Lethani,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is rooted deep inside you. Too deep for you to see. Sometimes it is the same with love.\u201d\nVashet reached out and tapped me on the forehead. \u201cAs for this Spinning Leaf. I have heard of similar things practiced by other paths. There is no Aturan word for it that I know. It is like a Ketan for your mind. A motion you make with your thoughts, to train them.\u201d\nShe made a dismissive gesture. \u201cEither way, it is not cheating. It is a way of revealing that which is hidden in the deep waters of your mind. The fact that you found it on your own is quite remarkable.\u201d\nI nodded to her. \u201cI bow to your wisdom, Vashet.\u201d \u201cYou bow to the fact that I am unarguably correct.\u201d", "She clapped her hands together. \u201cNow, I have much to teach you. However, as you are still welted and flinching, let us forbear the Ketan. Show me your Ademic instead. I want to hear you wound my lovely language with your rough barbarian tongue.\u201d\nI learned a great deal about Ademic over the next several hours. It was refreshing to be able to ask detailed questions and receive clear, specific answers in return. After a month of dancing about and drawing in the dirt, learning from Vashet was so easy it felt dishonest.\nOn the other hand, Vashet made it clear that my hand-language was embarrassingly crude. I could get my point across, but what I was doing was, at best, baby talk. At worst, it resembled the rantings of a deranged maniac.\n\u201cRight now you speak like this.\u201d She got to her feet, waved both hands over her head, and pointed to herself with both thumbs. \u201cI want to make good fight.\u201d She gave a wide, insipid grin. \u201cWith sword!\u201d She thumped her chest with both fists, then jumped into the air like an excited child.\n\u201cCome now,\u201d I said, embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019m not that bad.\u201d\n\u201cYou are close,\u201d Vashet said seriously as she sat back down on the bench. \u201cIf you were my son, I would not let you leave the house. As my student, it is only tolerable because you are a barbarian. It\u2019s as if Tempi brought home a dog that can whistle. The fact that you are out of tune stands quite beside the point.\u201d\nVashet made as if she would get to her feet. \u201cThat said, if you are happy speaking like a simpleton, just say the word and we can move to other things. . . .\u201d\nI reassured her I wanted to learn.\n\u201cFirst, you say too much, and you speak too loudly,\u201d she said. \u201cThe heart of Adem is stillness and silence. Our language reflects this.\n\u201cSecond, you must be much more careful with your gestures,\u201d she said. \u201cWith their placement and timing. They modify specific words and thoughts. They do not always reinforce what you say, sometimes they run purposely counter to your surface meaning.\u201d\nShe made seven or eight different gestures in quick succession. All of them said amusement, but each of them was slightly different. \u201cYou must also\n \ncome to understand the fine shades of meaning. The difference between slim and slender, as my poet king used to say. Right now you only have one smile, and that cannot help but make a person look a fool.\u201d\nWe worked for several hours, and Vashet made clear something Tempi could only hint at. Aturan was like a wide, shallow pool; it had many words, all very specific and precise. Ademic was like a deep well. There were fewer words, but they each had many meanings. A well-spoken sentence in Aturan is a straight line pointing. A well-spoken sentence in Adem is like a spiderweb, each strand with a meaning of its own, a piece of something greater, more complex.\nI arrived in the dining hall for supper in a considerably better mood than before. My welts still stung, but my fingers told me the swelling on my cheek was much reduced. I still sat alone, but I didn\u2019t keep my head down as I had before. Instead I watched the hands of everyone around me, trying to note the subtle shades of difference between excitement and interest, between denial and refusal.\nAfter supper, Vashet brought a small pot of salve which she smeared liberally across my back and upper arms, then more sparingly on my face. It tingled at first, then burned, then settled down to a dull, numb heat. Only after the pain along my back faded did I realize how tense my entire body had been.\n\u201cThere,\u201d Vashet said, twisting the stopper back into the bottle. \u201cHow is that?\u201d\n\u201cI could kiss you,\u201d I said gratefully.\n\u201cYou could,\u201d she said. \u201cBut your lip is swollen, and you would doubtless make a mess of it. Instead, show me your Ketan.\u201d\nI hadn\u2019t stretched, but not wanting to make excuses, I fell into Open Hands and began to move slowly through the rest.\nAs I\u2019ve already mentioned, Tempi usually stopped me when I made the slightest mistake in the Ketan. So when I reached the twelfth position without interruption, I felt rather smug. Then I misplaced my foot badly in Grandmother Gathers. When Vashet said nothing, I realized she was merely watching and withholding judgment until the end. I began to sweat, and\n \ndidn\u2019t stop until I reached the end of the Ketan ten minutes later.\nAfter I\u2019d finished, Vashet stood stroking her chin. \u201cWell,\u201d she said slowly.\n\u201cIt certainly could be worse . . .\u201d I felt a flicker of pride until she continued. \u201cYou could, for instance, be missing a leg.\u201d\nThen she walked in a circle around me, looking me up and down. She reached out to prod at my chest and stomach. She gripped at my upper arm and the thick muscle above my leg. I felt like a suckling pig brought to market.\nLastly she took hold of my hands, turning them over to examine them. She looked pleasantly surprised. \u201cYou never fought before Tempi taught you?\u201d she asked.\nI shook my head.\n\u201cYou have good hands,\u201d she said, her fingers running up my forearms, feeling at the muscles there. \u201cHalf of you barbarians have soft, weak hands from doing nothing. The other half have strong, stiff hands from cutting wood or working behind a plow.\u201d She turned my hands over in her own. \u201cBut you have strong, clever hands with good motion in your wrists.\u201d She looked up at me questioningly. \u201cWhat do you do for a living?\u201d\n\u201cI am a student at the University where I work with fine tools, shaping metal and stone.\u201d I explained. \u201cBut I\u2019m also a musician. I play the lute.\u201d\nVashet looked startled, then burst into laughter. She let my hands fall and shook her head in dismay. \u201cA musician on top of everything else,\u201d she said. \u201cPerfect. Does anyone else know?\u201d\n\u201cWhat does it matter?\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of who I am.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course you\u2019re not. That\u2019s part of the problem.\u201d She drew in a deep breath and let it out again. \u201cOkay. You should know about this as soon as possible. It will save us both trouble in the long run.\u201d She looked me in the eye. \u201cYou\u2019re a whore.\u201d\nI blinked. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cPay attention for a moment. You\u2019re not thick. You must have realized there are huge cultural differences between here and where you grew up in . . .\u201d\n\u201cThe Commonwealth,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re right. The cultural divide between Tempi and myself was huge compared to the other mercenaries from Vintas.\u201d\nShe nodded. \u201cPart of that is because Tempi has fewer wits than tits,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he is as fresh as a baby chick when it comes to making his way in", "the world.\u201d She waved a hand. \u201cAll that aside, you\u2019re right. There are huge differences.\u201d\n\u201cI noticed,\u201d I said. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to have a nudity taboo for one thing. Either that or Tempi is a bit of an exhibitionist.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d be curious how you found that out,\u201d she chuckled. \u201cBut you\u2019re right. Strange as it may seem to you, we have no particular fear of a naked body.\u201d\nVashet looked thoughtful for a moment, then seemed to reach some kind of decision. \u201cHere. It will be simpler to show you. Watch.\u201d\nI watched the familiar Adem impassivity slide over her face, leaving her face blank as new paper. Her voice lost most of its inflection at the same time, shedding its emotional content. \u201cTell me what I mean when I do this,\u201d she said.\nVashet stepped close, making no eye contact. Her hand said, respect. \u201cYou fight like a tiger.\u201d Her face was expressionless, her voice flat and calm. She grabbed hold of the top of my shoulder with one hand, and gripped my arm with the other, giving it a squeeze.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a compliment,\u201d I said.\nVashet nodded and stepped back. Then she changed. Her face grew animated. She smiled and met my eyes. She stepped close to me. \u201cYou fight like a tiger,\u201d she said, her voice glowing with admiration. One of her hands rested on the top of my shoulder while the other slipped around my biceps. She squeezed.\nI was suddenly embarrassed at how close we were standing. \u201cIt\u2019s a sexual advance,\u201d I said.\nVashet stepped away and nodded. \u201cYour folk view certain things as intimate. Naked skin. Physical contact. The nearness of a body. Loveplay. To the Adem, these are nothing remarkable.\u201d\nShe looked me in the eye. \u201cCan you think of a single time you have heard one of us shout? Raise our voice? Or even speak loudly enough we can be overheard?\u201d\nI thought for a moment, then shook my head.\n\u201cThat is because for us, speaking is private. Intimate. Facial expression too. And this . . .\u201d She pressed her fingers to her throat. \u201cThe warmth a voice can make. The emotion it reveals. That is a very private thing.\u201d\n\u201cAnd nothing carries more emotion than music,\u201d I said, understanding. It was a thought too strange for me to cope with all at once.\nVashet nodded gravely. \u201cA family might sing together if they are close. A", "mother might sing to her child. A woman might sing to her man.\u201d A slight flush rose on Vashet\u2019s cheeks as she said this. \u201cBut only if they are very much in love, and very much alone.\n\u201cBut you?\u201d She gestured to me. \u201cA musician? You do this to a whole room full of people. All at once. And for what? A few pennies? The price of a meal?\u201d She gave me a grave look. \u201cAnd you do it again and again. Night after night. With anyone.\u201d\nVashet shook her head in dismay and shuddered a bit, while her left hand unconsciously clenched in rough gestures: Horror, disgust, rebuke. It was rather intimidating getting both sets of emotional signals from her at the same time.\nI fought off the mental image of standing naked on the stage of the Eolian, then moving through the crowd, pressing my body to everyone there. Young and old. Fat and thin. Rich noble and penniless commoner. It was a sobering thought.\n\u201cBut Play Lute is the thirty-eighth position in the Ketan,\u201d I protested. I was grasping at straws and I knew it.\n\u201cAnd Sleeping Bear is twelfth.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cBut you will find no bears here, or lions, or lutes. Some names reveal. The names in the Ketan are meant to hide the truth, that we may speak of it without spilling its secrets to the open air.\u201d\n\u201cI understand,\u201d I said at last. \u201cBut many of you have been out in the world. You yourself speak Aturan beautifully and with much warmth in your voice. Surely you know there is nothing inherently wrong with a person singing.\u201d\n\u201cYou have been out in the world as well,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cAnd surely you know there is nothing inherently wrong with having sex with three people in a row on the broad hearth of a busy inn.\u201d She looked me in the eye pointedly.\n\u201cI imagine the stone would be rather rough. . . .\u201d I said.\nShe chuckled. \u201cVery well, assume they had use of a blanket too. What would you call that person?\u201d\nIf she\u2019d asked me two span ago, when I\u2019d been fresh out of the Fae, I might not have understood her. If I\u2019d stayed with Felurian any longer, it\u2019s entirely possible that having sex on the hearth wouldn\u2019t have seemed odd to me. But I\u2019d been back in the mortal world for a while now....\nA whore, I thought silently to myself. And a cheap and shameless whore to boot. I was glad I hadn\u2019t mentioned Tempi\u2019s desire to learn the lute to", "anyone. How ashamed he must have felt for such an innocent impulse. I thought of a young Tempi wanting to make music but never telling anyone because he knew it was dirty. It broke my heart.\nMy face must have given away quite a bit, because Vashet reached out to grip my hand gently. \u201cI know this is hard for you folk to understand. So much harder because you have never even entertained the possibility of thinking otherwise.\u201d Caution.\nI struggled with everything this implied. \u201cHow do you get your news?\u201d I asked. \u201cWith no troupers wandering from town to town, how do you keep in touch with the outside world?\u201d\nVashet smirked a bit at this, and made a gesture to the windswept landscape. \u201cDoes this seem to be a place that concerns itself overmuch with the turning of the world?\u201d She dropped her arm. \u201cBut it is not so bad as you think. Traveling peddlers are more welcome here than in most places. Tinkers doubly so. And we ourselves travel quite a bit. Those who take the red come and go, bringing news with them.\u201d\nShe laid a reassuring hand on my shoulder. \u201cAnd, occasionally, a rare singer or musician will travel through. But they do not play for a whole town at once. They will visit a single family. Even then, they perform while sitting behind a screen so they cannot be seen. You can tell an Adem musician because when they travel they carry their tall screens on their backs.\u201d Her mouth pursed a bit. \u201cBut even these are not viewed in an entirely favorable light. It is a valuable occupation, but not a respectable one.\u201d\nI relaxed a bit. The thought of a place where no performer was welcome struck me as profoundly wrong, sick even. But a place with strange customs I could understand. Adapting to fit your audience is common as changing costumes to the Edema Ruh.\nVashet continued. \u201cThis is the way of things, and you would do well to accept it sooner rather than later. I say this as a well-traveled woman. I have spent eight years among the barbarians. I have even listened to music in a group of people.\u201d She said this proudly, with a defiant tilt to her head. \u201cI have done it more than once.\u201d\n\u201cHave you ever sung in public?\u201d I asked.\nVashet\u2019s face went stony. \u201cThat is not a polite question to ask,\u201d she said, stiffly. \u201cAnd you will make no friends with it here.\u201d\n\u201cAll I mean,\u201d I said quickly, \u201cis that if you tried it, you might find it is nothing shameful. It is a great joy to everyone.\u201d", "Vashet gave me a severe look and made a hard gesture of refusal and finality. \u201cKvothe, I have traveled much and seen much. Many of the Adem here are worldly. We know of musicians. And, to be completely forthright, many of us have a secret, guilty fascination with them. Much the same way your folk are enamored with the skill of the Modegan courtesans.\u201d\nShe gave me a hard look. \u201cBut for all that, I would not want my daughter to bring one home, if you catch my meaning. Neither would it improve anyone\u2019s opinion of Tempi if others knew he had shared the Ketan with such as you. Keep it to yourself. You have enough to overcome without all Ademre knowing you are a musician on top of everything.\u201d", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FOURTEEN\nHis Sharp and Single Arrow\nRELUCTANTLY, I TOOK VASHET\u2019S advice. And though my fingers itched for it, I did not bring out my lute that night and fill my small corner of the school with music. I even went so far as to slide my lute case underneath my bed, lest the mere sight of it fill the school with rumor.\nFor several days I did little but study under Vashet. I ate alone and made no attempt to speak with anyone, as I was suddenly self-conscious of my language. Carceret kept her distance, but she was always there, watching me, her eyes flat and angry as a snake\u2019s.\nI took advantage of Vashet\u2019s excellent Aturan and asked a thousand questions that would have been too subtle for Tempi to understand.\nI waited three entire days until I asked her the question that had been slowly smoldering inside me since I\u2019d climbed the foothill of the Stormwal. Personally, I thought this showed exceptional restraint.\n\u201cVashet,\u201d I asked. \u201cDo your people have stories of the Chandrian?\u201d\nShe looked at me, her normally expressive face gone suddenly impassive. \u201cAnd what does this have to do with your hand-talk?\u201d Her hand flickered through several different variations of the gesture that indicated disapproval and reproach.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d I said.\n\u201cDoes it have something to do with your fighting, then?\u201d she asked. \u201cNo,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSurely it relates to the Ketan?\u201d Vashet said. \u201cOr to the Lethani? Or\nperhaps it touches on some subtle shade of meaning you have difficulty grasping in Ademic.\u201d\n\u201cI am merely curious.\u201d\nVashet sighed. \u201cCan I persuade you to focus your curiosity on more pressing matters?\u201d She asked, gesturing exasperated. Firm rebuke.\nI quickly let the matter drop. Not only was Vashet my teacher, she was my only companion. The last thing I wanted to do was irritate her, or give the", "impression that I was less than attentive to her lessons.\nWith that one disappointing exception, Vashet was a sparkling font of\ninformation. She answered my endless questions quickly and clearly. As a result, I couldn\u2019t help but feel that my skill in speaking and fighting was progressing in great leaps and bounds.\nVashet did not share my enthusiasm, and was not bashful about saying so. Eloquently. In two languages.\nVashet and I were down in the hidden valley that contained the sword tree. We had been practicing our hand fighting for about an hour, and were now sitting in the long grass, catching our breath.\nRather, I was catching my breath. Vashet was not winded at all. Fighting me was nothing to her, and there was no time when she couldn\u2019t chide me for sloppiness by reaching lazily past my defenses to cuff me on the side of the head.\n\u201cVashet,\u201d I said, mustering the courage to ask a question that had been bothering me for some time. \u201cMay I ask a question that is perhaps presumptuous?\u201d\n\u201cI prefer a presumptuous student,\u201d she said. \u201cI had hoped we were beyond the point of worrying about such things.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is the purpose of all of this?\u201d I gestured between the two of us.\n\u201cThe purpose of this,\u201d she mimicked my gesture, \u201cis to teach you enough so that you no longer fight like a little boy, drunk on his mother\u2019s wine.\u201d\nToday her sandy hair was tied in two short braids that hung down her back on either side of her neck. This made her look oddly girlish, and had not done wonders for my self-esteem over the last hour as she had repeatedly thrown me to the ground, forced me into submission, and struck me with countless solid but generously pulled punches and kicks.\nAnd once, laughing, she had stepped easily behind me and slapped me firmly on the ass, as if she were a lecherous taproom drunk and I some low- bodiced serving girl.\n\u201cBut why?\u201d I asked. \u201cTo what purpose are you teaching me? If Tempi was wrong to teach me, why continue to teach me more?\u201d\nVashet nodded approvingly. \u201cI\u2019ve been wondering how long it would take\n \nyou to ask that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt should have been one of your first questions.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been told I ask too many questions,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to step\na little more carefully here.\u201d\nVashet sat forward, suddenly businesslike. \u201cYou know things you should\nnot. Shehyn does not mind that you know of the Lethani, though others feel differently. But there is agreement on the subject of our Ketan. It is not for barbarians. It is only for the Adem, and only for those who follow the path of the sword tree.\u201d\nVashet continued, \u201cShehyn\u2019s thought is thus. If you were part of the school, you would be part of Ademre. If you are part of Ademre, you are no longer a barbarian. And if you are no longer a barbarian, it would not be wrong for you to know these things.\u201d\nIt had a certain convoluted logic to it. \u201cThat also means Tempi would not be wrong for teaching me.\u201d\nShe nodded. \u201cExactly. Instead of bringing home an unwanted puppy, it would be as if he had returned a lost lamb to the fold.\u201d\n\u201cMust I be a lamb or a puppy?\u201d I sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s undignified.\u201d\n\u201cYou fight as a puppy fights,\u201d she said. \u201cEager and clumsy.\u201d\n\u201cBut aren\u2019t I already part of the school?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou are teaching me,\nafter all.\u201d\nVashet shook her head. \u201cYou sleep in the school and eat our food, but that\ndoes not make you a student. Many children study the Ketan with hopes of entering the school and someday wearing the red. They live and study with us. They are in the school, but not of the school, if you follow me.\u201d\n\u201cIt seems odd to me that so many want to become mercenaries,\u201d I said as gently as possible.\n\u201cYou seem eager enough,\u201d she said with an edge to her voice.\n\u201cI am eager to learn,\u201d I said, \u201cnot take the life of a mercenary. I mean no offense.\u201d\nVashet stretched her neck, working out some stiffness. \u201cIt is your language getting in the way. In the barbarian lands, mercenaries are the lowest rung of society. No matter how thick or useless a man might be, he can carry a cudgel and earn a ha\u2019penny a day guarding a caravan. Am I right?\u201d\n\u201cThe lifestyle does tend to attract a rough sort of person,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWe are not mercenaries of that kind. We are paid, but we choose which jobs we take.\u201d She paused. \u201cIf you fight for your purse, you are a mercenary. What are you called if you fight out of duty for your country?\u201d", "\u201cA soldier.\u201d\n\u201cIf you fight for the law?\u201d\n\u201cA constable or a bailiff.\u201d\n\u201cIf you fight for your reputation?\u201d\nI had to think a bit on that one. \u201cA duelist, perhaps?\u201d\n\u201cIf you fight for the good of others?\u201d\n\u201cAn Amyr,\u201d I said without thinking.\nShe cocked her head at me. \u201cThat is an interesting choice,\u201d she said. Vashet held up her arm, displaying the red sleeve proudly. \u201cWe Adem are\npaid to guard, to hunt, to protect. We fight for our land and our school and our reputations. And we fight for the Lethani. With the Lethani. In the Lethani. All of these things together. The Adem word for one who takes the red is Cethan.\u201d She looked up at me. \u201cAnd it is a very proud thing.\u201d\n\u201cSo becoming a mercenary is quite high on the Adem social ladder,\u201d I said.\nShe nodded. \u201cBut barbarians do not know this word, and wouldn\u2019t understand even if they did. So \u2018mercenary\u2019 must suffice.\u201d\nVashet pulled two long strands of grass from the ground and began to twist them together into a cord. \u201cThis is why Shehyn\u2019s decision is not an easy one to make. She must balance what is right against what is best for her school. All the while taking into consideration the good of the entire path of the sword tree. Rather than make a rash decision, she is playing a more patient game. Personally, I think she\u2019s hoping the problem will take care of itself.\u201d\n\u201cHow would this take care of itself?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cYou could have run off,\u201d she said simply. \u201cMany assumed you would. If I\u2019d decided you were not worth teaching, that would have taken it out of her hands as well. Or you could die during your training, or become crippled.\u201d\nI stared at her.\nShe shrugged. \u201cAccidents happen. Not often, but sometimes. If Carceret had been your teacher . . .\u201d\nI grimaced. \u201cSo how does one officially become a member of the school? Is there some sort of test?\u201d\nShe shook her head, \u201cFirst, someone must stand on your behalf, saying you are worthy of joining the school.\u201d\n\u201cTempi?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cSomeone of consequence,\u201d she clarified.\n\u201cSo that would be you,\u201d I said slowly.\nVashet grinned, tapping the side of her crimped nose, then pointing at me.", "\u201cOnly took you two guesses. If you ever progress to the point I feel you won\u2019t embarrass me, I\u2019ll stand on your behalf and you can take the test.\u201d\nShe continued to twist the blades of grass together, her hands moving in a steady, complicated pattern. I\u2019d never seen another Adem idly toy with something like this while talking. They couldn\u2019t, of course. They needed one hand free to talk. \u201cIf you pass this test, you are no longer a barbarian. Tempi is vindicated, and everyone goes home happy. Except for those who aren\u2019t, of course.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t pass this test?\u201d I asked. \u201cOr what if you decide I\u2019m not good enough to take it?\u201d\n\u201cThen things grow complicated.\u201d She came to her feet. \u201cCome, Shehyn has asked to speak with you today. It would not be polite of us to be late.\u201d\nVashet led the way back to the small cluster of low stone buildings. When I\u2019d first seen them I\u2019d assumed they were the town itself. Now I knew they composed the school. The group of buildings was like a tiny University, except there was none of the scheduled regimen I was used to.\nThere was no formal ranking system, either. Those with their reds were treated with deference, and Shehyn was obviously in charge. Other than that, all I had was a vague impression of a social pecking order. Tempi was obviously rather low and not well-thought-of. Vashet was rather high and respected.\nWhen we arrived for our meeting, Shehyn was midway through performing the Ketan. I watched silently as she moved at the speed of honey spreading on a tabletop. The Ketan grows more difficult the slower it is done, but she performed it flawlessly.\nIt took her half an hour to finish, after which she opened a window. A curl of wind brought in the sweet smell of summer grass and the sound of leaves.\nShehyn sat. She wasn\u2019t breathing hard, though a sheen of sweat covered her skin. \u201cDid Tempi tell you of the nine-and-ninety tales?\u201d she asked without preamble. \u201cOf Aethe and the beginning of the Adem?\u201d\nI shook my head.\n\u201cGood,\u201d Shehyn said. \u201cIt is not his place to do such a thing, and he could not do it properly.\u201d She looked at Vashet. \u201cHow is language coming?\u201d\n \n\u201cQuickly, as these things go,\u201d she said. However.\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Shehyn said, switching to precise, slightly accented Aturan. \u201cI will tell it like this, so there will be less interruption, and less room for misunderstanding.\u201d\nI did my best to gesture respectful gratitude.\n\u201cThis is a story of years ago,\u201d Shehyn said formally. \u201cBefore this school. Before the path of the sword tree. Before any Adem knew of the Lethani. This is a story of the beginning of such things.\n\u201cThe first Adem school was not a school that taught sword-work. Surprisingly, it was founded by a man named Aethe who sought mastery over the arrow and the bow.\u201d\nShehyn paused in her tale and gave a word of explanation. \u201cYou should know that in those days, use of the bow was very common. The skill of it was much prized. We were shepherds, and much set on by our enemies, and the bow was the best tool we had to defend ourselves.\u201d\nShehyn leaned back in her chair and continued. \u201cAethe did not set out to found a school. There were no schools in those days. He merely sought to improve his skill. All his will he bent upon this, until he could shoot an apple from a tree one hundred feet away. Then he strove until he could shoot the wick of a burning candle. Soon the only target that challenged him was a piece of hanging silk blowing in the wind. Aethe strove until he could anticipate the turning of the wind, and once he had mastered this thing, he could not miss.\n\u201cStories of his talent spread, and others came to him. Among them was a young woman named Rethe. At first Aethe doubted she possessed the strength to draw the bow. But she was soon regarded as his finest student.\n\u201cAs I have said, this was long years and distant miles from where we sit. In those days, the Adem did not have the Lethani to guide us, and so it was a rough and bloody time. In those days it was not uncommon for one Adem to kill another out of pride, or from an argument, or as a proof of skill.\n\u201cSince Aethe was the greatest of archers, many challenged him. But a body is nothing of a target when one can strike silk blowing in the wind. Aethe slew them easily as cutting wheat. He took only a single arrow with him to a duel, and claimed if that single arrow was not enough, he deserved to be struck down.\n\u201cAethe grew older, and his fame spread. He put down roots and began the first of the Adem schools. Years passed, and he trained many Adem to be", "deadly as knives. It became well known that if you gave Aethe\u2019s students three arrows and three coins, your three worst enemies would never bother you again.\n\u201cSo the school grew rich and famous and proud. And so did Aethe.\n\u201cIt was then that Rethe came to him. Rethe, his best student. Rethe who stood nearest his ear and closest to his heart.\n\u201cRethe spoke to Aethe, and they disagreed. Then they argued. Then they shouted loud enough that all the school could hear it through the thick stone walls.\n\u201cAnd at the end of it, Rethe challenged Aethe to a duel. Aethe accepted, and it was known that the winner would control the school from that day forth.\n\u201cAs the challenged, Aethe chose his place first. He chose to stand among a grove of young and swaying trees that gave him shifting cover. Normally he would not bother with precautions such as this, but Rethe was his finest student, and she could read the wind just as well as he. He took with him his bow of horn. He took with him his sharp and single arrow.\n\u201cThen Rethe chose her place to stand. She walked to the top of a high hill, her outline clear against the naked sky. She carried neither bow nor arrow. And when she reached the top of the hill, she sat calmly on the ground. This was perhaps the oddest thing of all, as Aethe was known to sometimes strike a foe through the leg rather than kill them.\n\u201cAethe saw his student do this, and he was filled with anger. Aethe took his single arrow and fitted it to his bow. Aethe drew the string against his ear. The string Rethe had made for him, woven from the long, strong strands of her own hair.\u201d\nShehyn met my eye. \u201cFull of anger, Aethe shot his arrow. It struck Rethe like a thunderbolt. Here.\u201d She pointed with two fingers at the inner curve of her left breast.\n\u201cStill seated, arrow sprouting from her chest, Rethe drew a long ribbon of white silk from beneath her shirt. She took a white feather from the arrow\u2019s fletching, dipped it in her blood, and wrote four lines of poetry.\n\u201cThen Rethe held the ribbon aloft for a long moment, waiting as the wind pulled first one way, then another. Then Rethe loosed it, the silk twisting through the air, rising and falling on the breeze. The ribbon twisted in the wind, wove its way through the trees, and pressed itself firmly against Aethe\u2019s chest.", "\u201cIt read:\nAethe, near my heart. Without vanity, the ribbon. Without duty, the wind. Without blood, the victory.\nI heard a low noise and looked over to see Vashet weeping quietly to herself. Her head was lowered, and tears ran down her face to drip deeper spots of red onto the front of her shirt.\nShehyn continued. \u201cOnly after Aethe read these lines did he recognize the deep wisdom his student possessed. He hurried to tend Rethe\u2019s wounds, but the head of the arrow was lodged too close to her heart to be removed.\n\u201cRethe lived only three days after that, with the grief-stricken Aethe tending her. He gave her control of the school, and listened to her words, all the while the head of the arrow riding close to her heart.\n\u201cDuring those days, Rethe dictated nine-and-ninety stories, and Aethe wrote them down. These tales were the beginning of our understanding of the Lethani. They are the root of all Ademre.\n\u201cLate in the third day Rethe finished telling the ninety-ninth story to Aethe, who now held himself to be his student\u2019s student. After Aethe finished writing, Rethe said to him, \u2018There is one final story, more important than all the rest, and that one shall be known when I awake.\u2019\n\u201cThen Rethe closed her eyes and slept. And sleeping, she died.\n\u201cAethe lived forty years after that, and it is said he never killed again. In the years that followed, he was often heard to say, \u2018I won the only duel I ever lost.\u2019\n\u201cHe continued to run the school and train his students to be masters of the bow. But now he also trained them to be wise. He told them the nine-and- ninety tales, and thus it was the Lethani first came to be known by all Ademre. And that is how we came to be that which we are.\u201d\nThere was a long pause.\n\u201cI thank you, Shehyn,\u201d I said doing my best to gesture respectful gratitude.\u201cI would very much like to hear these nine-and-ninety stories.\u201d\n\u201cThey are not for barbarians,\u201d she said. But she didn\u2019t seem offended at my request, gesturing a combination of reproach and regret. She changed the subject. \u201cHow is your Ketan coming?\u201d", "\u201cI struggle to improve, Shehyn.\u201d\nShe turned to Vashet. \u201cDoes he?\u201d\n\u201cThere is certainly struggle,\u201d Vashet said, her eyes still red with tears. Wry\namusement. \u201cBut there is improvement, too.\u201d\nShehyn nodded. Reserved approval. \u201cSeveral of us will be fighting\ntomorrow. Perhaps you could bring him to watch.\u201d\nVashet made an elegant motion that made me appreciate how little I knew\nof the subtleties of hand-language: Gracious thankful slightly submissive acceptance.\n\u201cYou should be flattered,\u201d Vashet said cheerfully. \u201cA conversation with Shehyn and an invitation to watch her fight.\u201d\nWe were making our way back to a sheltered box valley where we typically practiced the Ketan and our hand fighting.\nHowever, my mind kept spinning back to several unavoidable and unpleasant thoughts. I was thinking about secrets and how people longed to keep them. I wondered what Kilvin would do if I brought someone into the Fishery and showed them the sygaldry for blood and bone and hair.\nThe thought of the big artificer\u2019s anger was enough to make me shiver. I knew the sort of trouble I would face. That was clearly laid out in the University\u2019s laws. But what would he do to the person I had taught these things to?\nVashet slapped my chest with the back of her hand to get my attention. \u201cI said you should be flattered,\u201d she repeated.\n\u201cI am,\u201d I said.\nShe took hold of my shoulder, turning me to face her. \u201cYou\u2019ve gone all pensive on me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat will be done with Tempi if all of this ends badly?\u201d I asked bluntly.\nHer cheerful expression faded. \u201cHis reds will be taken away, and his sword, and his name, and he will be cut away from the Latantha.\u201d She drew a slow breath. \u201cIt is unlikely any other school would take him after such a thing, so this would effectively exile him from all Ademre.\u201d\n\u201cBut exile won\u2019t work for me,\u201d I said. \u201cForcing me back into the world would only make the problem worse, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\n \nVashet didn\u2019t say anything.\n\u201cWhen all of this started,\u201d I said. \u201cYou encouraged me to leave. If I had run, would I have been allowed to go?\u201d\nThere was a long silence that told me the truth of it. But she said it aloud, too. \u201cNo.\u201d\nI appreciated not being lied to about it. \u201cAnd what is my punishment to be?\u201d I asked. \u201cImprisonment?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cNo. It\u2019s not practical to keep me locked up here for years.\u201d I looked up at her. \u201cSo what?\u201d\n\u201cPunishment is not our concern,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are a barbarian, after all. You did not know you were doing anything wrong. The main concern is to prevent you from teaching others what you have stolen, to keep you from using it to your own profit.\u201d\nShe hadn\u2019t answered my question. I gave her a long look.\n\u201cSome say killing you would be the best way,\u201d she said frankly. \u201cBut most believe killing is not in keeping with the Lethani. Shehyn is among these. As am I.\u201d\nI relaxed slightly, that was something at least. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t suppose a promise on my part would reassure anyone?\u201d\nShe gave me a sympathetic smile. \u201cIt speaks well of you that you came back with Tempi. And you stayed when I tried to drive you away. But the promise of a barbarian amounts for little in this.\u201d\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d I asked, suspecting the answer and knowing I wasn\u2019t going to like it.\nShe took a deep breath. \u201cYou could be prevented from teaching by removing your tongue or putting out your eyes,\u201d she said frankly. \u201cTo keep you from using the Ketan you might be hobbled. Your ankle tendon cut, or the knee of your favored leg lamed.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cBut one can still be a good fighter even with a damaged leg. So it would be more effective to remove the two smallest fingers from your right hand. This would be . . .\u201d\nVashet kept speaking in her matter-of-fact tone. I think she intended it to be reassuring, calming. But it had the opposite effect. All I could think of was her cutting off my fingers as calmly as you would pare away a piece of apple. Everything grew bright around the edges of my vision, and the vivid mental picture made my stomach roll over. I thought for a moment I might be sick.\nThe light-headedness and nausea passed. As I came to my senses, I realized Vashet had finished talking and was staring at me.\nBefore I could say anything, she waved a hand dismissively. \u201cI see I will", "get no more use of you today. Take the rest of the evening for yourself. Get your thoughts in order or practice the Ketan. Go watch the sword tree. Tomorrow we will continue.\u201d\nI walked aimlessly for a while, trying not to think about my fingers being cut away. Then, coming over a hill, I stumbled almost literally onto a naked Adem couple tucked away in a grove of trees.\nThey didn\u2019t scramble for their clothes when I burst out of the trees, and rather than try to apologize with my poor language and fuddled wits, I simply turned and left, face burning with embarrassment.\nI tried to practice the Ketan but couldn\u2019t keep my mind on it. I went to watch the sword tree, and for a while the sight of it moving gracefully in the wind calmed me. Then my mind drifted and I was confronted with the image of Vashet paring off my fingers again.\nI heard the three high bells and went to dinner. I was standing in line, half stupid with the mental effort of not thinking of someone maiming my hands, when I noticed the Adem standing nearby were staring at me.A young girl of about ten wore an expression of open amazement on her face, and a man in his mercenary reds looked at me as if he had just seen me wipe my ass with a piece of bread and eat it.\nOnly then did I realize I was humming. Not loud, exactly, but loud enough for those nearby to hear. I couldn\u2019t have been doing it for long, as I was only six lines into \u201cLeave the Town, Tinker.\u201d\nI stopped, then lowered my eyes, took my food, and spent ten minutes trying to eat. I managed a few bites, but that was all. Eventually I gave up and headed to my room.\nI lay in bed, running through the options in my mind. How far could I run? Could I lose myself in the surrounding countryside? Could I steal a horse? Had I even seen a horse since I\u2019d been in Haert?\nI brought out my lute and practiced my chording a bit, all five of my clever fingers flicking up and down the long neck of the lute. But my right hand ached to strum and pick notes from the strings. It was as frustrating as trying to kiss someone using only one lip, and I soon gave up.\nAt last I brought out my shaed and wrapped it around myself. It was warm\n \nand comforting. I drew the hood over my head as far as it would go and thought of the dark piece of Fae where Felurian had gathered its shadows.\nI thought of the University, of Wil and Sim. Of Auri and Devi and Fela. I had never been popular at the University, and my circle of friends had never seemed particularly large. But the truth was I\u2019d simply forgotten what it was like to be truly alone.\nI thought of my family then. I thought of the Chandrian, of Cinder. His fluid grace. His sword held easy in his hand like a piece of winter ice. I thought of killing him.\nI thought of Denna and what the Cthaeh had told me. I thought of her patron and the things I had said during our fight. I thought about the time she had slipped on the road and I had caught her, how the gentle curve above her hip had felt against my hand. I thought about the shape of her mouth, the sound of her voice, the smell of her hair.\nAnd, eventually, I stepped softly through the doors of sleep.", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN\nStorm and Stone\nI WOKE THE NEXT MORNING knowing the truth. My only way out of this situation was through the school. I needed to prove myself. That meant I needed everything Vashet could teach me as quickly as possible.\nSo the next morning I rose in the pale blue light of dawn. And when Vashet emerged from her small stone house I was waiting for her. I was not particularly bright-eyed or bushy-tailed, as my sleep had been filled with troubling dreams, but I was ready to learn.\nI realize now that I may have given an inaccurate impression of Haert.\nIt was no thriving metropolis, obviously. And it couldn\u2019t be considered a\ncity by any stretch of the imagination. In some ways it was barely a town. I do not say this disparagingly. I spent the majority of my young life\ntraveling with my troupe, moving from small town to small town. Half the world is made of tiny communities that have grown up around nothing more than a crossroads market, or a good clay pit, or a bend of river strong enough to turn a mill wheel.\nSometimes these towns are prosperous. Some have rich soil and generous weather. Some thrive on the trade moving through them. The wealth of these places is obvious. The houses are large and well-mended. People are friendly and generous. The children are fat and happy. There are luxuries for sale: pepper and cinnamon and chocolate. There is coffee and good wine and music at the local inn.\nThen there are the other sort of towns. Towns where the soil is thin and tired. Towns where the mill burned down, or the clay was mined out years ago. In these places the houses are small and badly patched. The people are lean and suspicious, and wealth is measured in small, practical ways. Cords\n \nof firewood. A second pig. Five jars of blackberry preserve.\nAt first glance, Haert seemed to be this sort of town. It was little more than\ntiny homes, broken stone, and the occasional penned goat.\nIn most parts of the Commonwealth, or anywhere in the Four Corners for\nthat matter, a family living in a small cottage with only a few sticks of furniture would be viewed as unfortunate. One step away from paupers.\nBut while most of the Adem homes I had seen were relatively small, they weren\u2019t the same sort you would find in a desperate Aturan town, made of sod and logs chinked with mud.\nThe Adem homes were all snug stone, fit together as cunningly as anything I had ever seen. There were no cracks letting in the endless wind. No leaking roofs. No cracking leather hinges on the doors. The windows weren\u2019t oiled sheepskin or empty holes with wooden shutters. They were fitted glass, tight as any you\u2019d find in a banker\u2019s manor.\nI never saw a fireplace in all my time in Haert. Don\u2019t get me wrong, fireplaces are better than freezing to death by a long step. But most of the rough ones folk can build for themselves out of loose fieldstone or cinder- brick are drafty, dirty, and inefficient. They fill your house with soot and your lungs with smoke.\nInstead of fireplaces, each Adem home had its own iron stove. The sort of stove that weighs hundreds of pounds. The sort of stove made of thick drop- iron so you can stoke it until it glows with heat. The sort of stove that lasts a century and costs more than a farmer earns from an entire year of hard harvesting. Some of these stoves were small, good for heating and cooking. But I saw more than a few that were larger and could be used for baking too. One of these treasures was tucked away in a low stone house of only three rooms.\nThe rugs on the Adem floors were mostly simple, but they were of thick, soft wool, deeply dyed. The floors beneath those rugs were smooth-sanded wood, not dirt. There were no guttering tallow tapers or reedlights. There were beeswax candles or lamps that burned a clean white oil. And once, through a distant window, I recognized the unwavering red light of a sympathy lamp.\nIt was this last that made me realize the truth. This was not a scattered handful of desperate folk, scratching out a lean existence on the bare mountainside. They were not living hand-to-mouth, eating cabbage soup and living in fear of winter. This community was comfortably, quietly", "prosperous.\nMore than that. Despite the lack of glittering banquet halls and fancy\ngowns, despite the absence of servants and statuary, each of these homes was like a tiny manor house. They were each of them wealthy in a quiet, practical way.\n\u201cWhat did you think?\u201d Vashet said, laughing at me. \u201cThat a handful of us win our reds and run off to lives of mad luxury while our families drink their own bathwater and die of scurvy?\u201d\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t though of it at all, really,\u201d I said, looking around. Vashet was beginning to show me how to use a sword. We had been at it for two hours, and she had done little more than explain the different ways of holding it. As if it were a baby and not a piece of steel.\nNow that I knew what to look for, I could see dozens of the Adem houses worked cunningly into the landscape. Heavy wooden doors were dug into bluffs. Others looked like little more than tumbles of stone. Some had grass growing on their roofs and could only be recognized by the stovepipes peeping out. A fat nanny goat grazed atop one of these, her udder swinging as she stretched out her neck to crop a mouthful of grass.\n\u201cLook at the land around you,\u201d she said, spinning in a slow circle to take in the landscape. \u201cThe ground is too thin for the plow, too jagged for horses. The summer too wet for wheat, too harsh for fruit. Some mountains hold iron, or coal, or gold. But not these mountains. In winter the snow will pile higher than your head. In spring the storms will push you from your feet.\u201d\nShe looked back at me. \u201cThis is our land because no one else wants it.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cOr rather, it became ours for that reason.\u201d\nVashet adjusted her sword on her shoulder, then eyed me speculatively. \u201cSit and listen,\u201d she said formally. \u201cAnd I will tell a story of a time long gone.\u201d\nI sat on the grass, and Vashet took her place on a nearby stone. \u201cLong ago,\u201d she said, \u201cthe Adem were upheaved from our rightful place. Something we cannot remember drove us out. Someone stole our land, or ruined it, or made us flee in fear. We were forced to wander endlessly. Our whole nation mendicant, like beggars. We would find a place, and settle, and rest our\n \nflocks. Then those who lived nearby would drive us off.\n\u201cThe Adem were fierce back then. If we had not been fierce, there would\nbe none of us left today. But we were few, so we were always driven forth. Finally we found this thin and windy place, unwanted by the world. We dug our roots deep into the stone and made it ours.\u201d\nVashet\u2019s eyes wandered the landscape. \u201cBut this land had little to give us, a place for our flocks to graze, stone, and endless wind. We could not find a way to sell the wind, so we sold our fierceness to the world. So we lived, and slowly we sharpened ourselves into the thing we are today. No longer only fierce, but dangerous and proud. Unceasing as the wind and strong as stone.\u201d\nI waited a moment to make sure she was finished. \u201cMy people are wanderers too,\u201d I said. \u201cIt is our way. Nowhere and everywhere is where we live.\u201d\nShe shrugged, smiling. \u201cIt is a story, mind you. And an old one. Take from it what you will.\u201d\n\u201cI am fond of stories,\u201d I said.\n\u201cA story is like a nut,\u201d Vashet said. \u201cA fool will swallow it whole and choke. A fool will throw it away, thinking it of little worth.\u201d She smiled. \u201cBut a wise woman finds a way to crack the shell and eat the meat inside.\u201d\nI got to my feet and walked to where she was sitting. I kissed her hands and her forehead and her mouth. \u201cVashet,\u201d I said. \u201cI am glad Shehyn gave me to you.\u201d\n\u201cYou are a foolish boy.\u201d She looked down, but I could see a faint blush rising on her face as she spoke. \u201cCome. We should go. You do not want to miss the chance to see Shehyn fight.\u201d\nVashet led me to an unmarked piece of meadow where the thick grass had been grazed close to the ground. A few other Adem already stood nearby, waiting. Some folk had brought small stools or rolled pieces of log to use as benches. Vashet simply sat on the ground. I joined her.\nA crowd slowly gathered. Only thirty people or so, but it was the most Adem I\u2019d ever seen together other than in the dining hall. They gathered in twos and threes, moving from one conversation to another. Rarely did a group of five coalesce for any length of time.\n \nThough there were a dozen conversations all within a stone\u2019s throw of me, I couldn\u2019t hear more than a murmur. The speakers stood close enough to touch, and the wind in the grass made more noise than their voices.\nBut I could tell the tone of each conversation from where I sat. Two months ago this gathering would have seemed eerily subdued. A gathering of fidgety, emotionless, near-mutes. But now I could plainly see one pair of Adem were teacher and student by how far apart they stood, by the deference in the younger woman\u2019s hands. The cluster of three red-shirted men were friends, easy and joking as they jostled at each other. That man and woman were fighting. She was angry. He was trying to explain.\nI suddenly wondered how I ever could have thought of these people as restless or fidgety. Every motion was to a purpose. Every shifting of the feet implied a change in attitude. Every gesture spoke volumes.\nVashet and I sat close to each other and kept our voices low, continuing our discussion in Aturan. She explained how each school had standing accounts with the Cealdish moneylenders. That meant far-flung mercenaries could deposit the school\u2019s share of their earnings anywhere people used Cealdish currency, which meant anywhere in the entire civilized world. That money was then tallied to the appropriate account so the school could make use of it.\n\u201cHow much does a mercenary send back to the school?\u201d I asked, curious. \u201cEighty percent,\u201d she said.\n\u201cEight percent?\u201d I asked, holding up all my fingers but two, sure I had\nmisheard.\n\u201cEighty,\u201d Vashet said firmly. \u201cThat is the proper amount, though many\npride themselves on giving more. The same would be true for you,\u201d she said dismissively, \u201cif you stood a fiddler\u2019s chance in hell of ever wearing the red.\u201d Seeing my astonishment, she explained. \u201cIt is not so much, when you think\nof it. For years, the school feeds and clothes you. It gives you a place to sleep. It gives you your sword, your training. After this investment, the mercenary supports the school. The school supports the village. The village produces children who hope to someday take the red.\u201d She made a circle with her finger. \u201cThus all Ademre thrives.\u201d\nVashet gave me a grave look. \u201cKnowing this, perhaps you can begin to understand what you have stolen,\u201d she said. \u201cNot just a secret but the major export of the Adem. You have stolen the key to this entire town\u2019s survival.\u201d\nIt was a sobering thought. Suddenly Carceret\u2019s anger made much better", "sense.\nI caught a glimpse of Shehyn\u2019s white shirt and roughly knitted yellow cap\nthrough the crowd. The scattered conversations grew still, and everyone began to gather into a large, loose circle.\nIt wasn\u2019t just Shehyn fighting today, apparently. The first to fight were two boys a few years younger than myself, neither of them wearing red. They circled each other warily, then fell on each other in a flurry of blows.\nIt was too fast for my eye to follow, and I saw a dozen half-formed pieces of the Ketan scattered and discarded. It finally ended when one boy caught the other\u2019s wrist and shoulder in Sleeping Bear. It was only when I saw the boy twist his opponent\u2019s arm and force him to the ground that I recognized it as the grip Tempi had used in the bar fight in Crosson.\nThe boys separated, and two red-shirted mercenaries came out to talk to them, presumably their teachers.\nVashet leaned her head close to mine. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re very quick,\u201d I said.\nShe looked at me. \u201cBut ...\u201d\n\u201cThey seem rather sloppy,\u201d I said, being careful to speak quietly. \u201cNot at\nfirst, but after they started.\u201d I pointed at one. \u201cHis feet were too close together. And the other kept leaning forward so his balance was off. That\u2019s how he got caught in Sleeping Bear.\u201d\nVashet nodded, pleased. \u201cThey fight like puppies. They are young, and boys. They are full of anger and impatience. Women have less trouble with these things. It\u2019s part of what makes us better fighters.\u201d\nI was more than slightly surprised to hear her say that. \u201cWomen are better fighters?\u201d I asked carefully, not wanting to contradict her.\n\u201cGenerally speaking,\u201d she said matter-of-factly. \u201cThere are exceptions, of course, but as a whole women are better.\u201d\n\u201cBut men are stronger,\u201d I said. \u201cTaller. They have better reach.\u201d\nShe turned to look at me, slightly amused. \u201cAre you stronger and taller than me then?\u201d\nI smiled. \u201cObviously not. But as a whole, you have to admit, men are bigger and stronger.\u201d\nVashet shrugged. \u201cAnd that would matter if fighting were the same as splitting wood or hauling hay. That is like saying a sword is better the longer and heavier it is. Foolishness. Perhaps for thugs this is true. But after taking the red, the key is knowing when to fight. Men are full of anger, so they have", "trouble with this. Women less so.\u201d\nI opened my mouth, then thought of Dedan and closed it.\nA shadow fell over us, and I looked up to see a tall man in his reds\nstanding at a polite distance. He held his hand poised near the hilt of his sword. Invitation.\nVashet gestured back. Gentle regret and refusal.\nI watched as he walked away. \u201cWon\u2019t they think less of you for not fighting?\u201d\nVashet sniffed disdainfully. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to fight,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would only embarrass him and waste my time. He merely wanted to show he was brave enough to fight me.\u201d She sighed and gave me a pointed look. \u201cIt is that sort of foolishness that leads men from the Lethani.\u201d\nThe next match was between two red-shirted mercenaries, and the difference was obvious. Everything was much cleaner and crisper. The two boys had been frantic as sparrows flapping in the dust, but the fights that followed were elegant as dances.\nMany of the bouts were hand fighting. These lasted until one person submitted or was visibly stunned by a blow.\nOne fight stopped immediately when a man bloodied his opponent\u2019s nose. Vashet rolled her eyes at this, though I couldn\u2019t tell if she thought less of the woman for allowing herself to be struck, or the man for being reckless enough to hurt her.\nThere were several bouts with wooden swords, too. These tended to go more quickly, as even a light touch was considered enough for a victory.\n\u201cWho won that one?\u201d I asked. After a quick exchange of clacking swordplay ended with both women scoring hits at the same time.\n\u201cNeither,\u201d she said, frowning.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t they fight again if it was a tie?\u201d I asked.\nVashet frowned at me. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a tie, strictly speaking. Drenn would have\ndied in minutes, struck through the lung. Lasrel would have died in days when the wound in her gut soured.\u201d\n\u201cSo Lasrel won?\u201d\nVashet gave me a look of withering contempt and turned her attention back to the next fight.\nThe tall Adem man who had asked Vashet to fight was bouting with a thin whip of a woman. Strangely, he used a wooden sword while she was barehanded. He won by a narrow margin after catching two solid kicks to the", "ribs.\n\u201cWho won there?\u201d Vashet asked me.\nI could tell she wasn\u2019t looking for the obvious answer. \u201cIt\u2019s not much of a\nvictory,\u201d I said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t even have a sword.\u201d\n\u201cShe is of the third stone and far outstrips him as a fighter. It was the only\nway for things to be balanced between them unless he were to bring a companion to fight by his side,\u201d Vashet pointed out. \u201cSo I ask again. Who won?\u201d\n\u201cHe won the bout,\u201d I said. \u201cBut he\u2019ll have some impressive bruises tomorrow. Also, his swings seemed somewhat reckless.\u201d\nVashet turned to look at me. \u201cSo who won?\u201d\nI thought about it for a moment. \u201cNeither,\u201d I decided.\nShe nodded. Formal approval. The gesture warmed me, as everyone facing\nus could see it.\nAt long last, Shehyn stepped into the circle. She had removed her lopsided\nyellow hat, and her greying hair swirled about in the wind. Seeing her among the other Adem, I realized how small she was. She carried herself with such confidence that I had come to think of her as taller, but she barely came up to the shoulder of some of the taller Adem.\nShe carried a straight wooden sword with her. Nothing ornate, but it was carved to have the shape of a hilt and blade. Many of the other practice swords I had seen were barely more than smoothed sticks that gave the impression of being swords. Her white shirt and pants were tied tightly to her body with thin white chords.\nAlongside Shehyn came a much younger woman. She was shorter than Shehyn by an inch or so. Her frame was more delicate, too, her small face and shoulders making her look almost childlike. But the pronounced curve of her high breasts and round hips beneath her tight mercenary reds made it obvious she was no child.\nHer wooden sword was also carved. It was curved slightly, unlike most of the others I had seen. Her sandy hair was braided into a long, narrow plait that hung down to the small of her back.\nThe two of them raised their swords and began to circle each other.\nThe young woman was amazing. She struck so fast I could barely see the motion of her hand, let alone the blade of her sword. But Shehyn brushed it away casually with Drifting Snow, taking half a step in retreat. Then, before Shehyn could respond with an attack of her own, the young woman spun", "away, her long braid swinging.\n\u201cWho is she?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cPenthe,\u201d Vashet said admiringly. \u201cShe is a fury, is she not? Like one of\nour old ancestors.\u201d\nPenthe closed with Shehyn again, feinting and thrusting. She darted in, low\nto the ground. Impossibly low. Her back leg thrust out for balance, not even touching the ground. Her sword arm licked out in front of her, her knee bent so deeply that her entire body was below the level of my head, even though I was sitting cross-legged on the ground.\nPenthe unfurled all this sinuous motion as quickly you can snap your fingers. The tip of her sword came in low under Shehyn\u2019s guard and angled up toward her knee.\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d I asked softly, not even expecting an answer. \u201cYou never showed me that.\u201d But it was just astonished noise. Never in a hundred years could my body do that.\nBut Shehyn somehow avoided the attack. Not leaping away with any sudden motion. Not darting out of reach. She was quick, but that was not the heart of how she moved. Instead she was deliberate and perfect. She was already halfway gone before Penthe\u2019s sword had begun to flick toward her leg. The tip of Penthe\u2019s sword must have come within an inch of her knee. But it was not a close thing. Shehyn had only moved as much as was needed, no more.\nThis time Shehyn did manage to counterattack, stepping forward with Sparrow Strikes the Hawk. Penthe rolled sideways, touched the grass briefly, then pushed herself up off the ground. No, she threw herself away from the ground using only her left hand. Her body snapped like a steel spring, arcing away while her sword licked out twice, driving Shehyn back.\nPenthe was full of passion and fury. Shehyn was calm and steady. Penthe was a storm. Shehyn a stone. Penthe was a tiger and Shehyn a bird. Penthe danced and wove madly. Shehyn turned and took one single perfect step.\nPenthe slashed and spun and whirled and struck and struck and struck....\nAnd then they stopped, the tip of Penthe\u2019s wooden sword pressed to Shehyn\u2019s white shirt.\nI gasped, though not loudly enough to draw any attention. Only then did I realize my heart was racing. My entire body was covered in sweat.\nShehyn lowered her sword, gesturing irritation, admiration, and a mingling of other things I couldn\u2019t identify. She bared her teeth a little in a", "grimace and used her hand to chafe roughly at her ribs where Penthe had struck her. The same way you rub your shin when you bark it against a chair. Horrified, I turned to Vashet. \u201cWill she be the new leader of the school?\u201d I\nasked.\nVashet looked at me, puzzled.\nI gestured to the open circle in front of us where the two women stood\ntalking. \u201cThis Penthe. She\u2019s beaten Shehyn . . .\u201d\nVashet looked at me for a moment, uncomprehending, then burst out in a\nlong, delighted laugh. \u201cShehyn is old,\u201d she said. \u201cShe is a grandmother.You cannot expect her to always win against a limber young thing like Penthe, all full of fire and fresh wind.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d I said. \u201cI see. I thought . . .\u201d\nVashet was kind enough not to laugh at me again. \u201cShehyn is not the head of the school because no one can beat her. What an odd notion. What chaos that would be, everything tipping this way and that, changing with the luck of one fight or another.\u201d\nShe shook her head. \u201cShehyn is the head because she is a marvelous teacher, and because her understanding of the Lethani is deep. She is the head because she is wise in the ways of the world, and because she is clever at dealing with troublesome problems.\u201d She tapped me pointedly on the chest with two fingers.\nThen Vashet made a conciliatory gesture. \u201cShe is also an excellent fighter, of course. We would not have a leader who could not fight. Shehyn\u2019s Ketan is without equal. But a leader is not a muscle. A leader is a mind.\u201d\nI looked up in time to see Shehyn approaching. One of the cords holding her sleeve in place had come loose during the fight, and the cloth was fluttering in the wind like a luffing sail. She had donned her lopsided yellow cap again and gestured formal greeting to both of us.\nThen Shehyn turned to me. \u201cAt the end,\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy was I struck?\u201d Curiosity.\nFrantically, I thought back to the final moments of the fight, looking them over in my mind\u2019s eye.\nI tried to gesture with the subtlety Vashet had been teaching me: respectful uncertainty. \u201cYou misplaced your heel slightly,\u201d I said. \u201cYour left heel.\u201d\nShehyn nodded. \u201cGood.\u201d She gestured pleased approval widely enough so anyone who happened to be watching could see it. And, of course, everyone was.", "Giddy with praise, but conscious of the fact I was being watched, I kept my face locked in the proper impassivity as Shehyn walked away with Penthe in tow.\nI leaned my head close to Vashet\u2019s. \u201cI like Shehyn\u2019s little hat,\u201d I said.\nVashet shook her head and sighed. \u201cCome.\u201d She jostled my shoulder with her own and got to her feet. \u201cWe should leave before you spoil the good impression you have made today.\u201d\nThat night at supper, I sat in my customary place at the corner of one table by the wall farthest from the food. Since no one was willing to sit within ten feet of me, there was no sense my taking up space where people might actually want to sit.\nMy good mood still buoyed me, so I was not surprised when I saw a flicker of red slide into the seat across from me. Carceret again. Once or twice a day she made a point to come close enough to hiss a few words at me. She was overdue.\nBut looking up, I was surprised. Vashet sat across from me. She nodded, her impassive face staring into my astonished one. Then I composed myself, nodded back, and we ate for a while in companionable silence. After we were finished eating, we passed some time pleasantly, speaking softly of small things.\nWe left the dining hall together, and when we stepped into the evening air, I switched back into Aturan so I could properly articulate something I\u2019d been thinking for several hours.\n\u201cVashet,\u201d I said. \u201cIt occurs to me it would be nice to fight someone whose ability is somewhat closer to my own.\u201d\nVashet laughed, shaking her head. \u201cThat is like throwing two virgins into a bed. Enthusiasm, passion, and ignorance are not a good combination. Someone is likely to get hurt.\u201d\n\u201cI hardly think it\u2019s fair to call my fighting virginal,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not near your level, but you yourself said my Ketan is remarkably good.\u201d\n\u201cI said your Ketan was remarkably good considering the amount of time you have been studying,\u201d she corrected me. \u201cWhich is less than two months. Which is no time at all.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating,\u201d I admitted. \u201cIf I strike a blow against you, it\u2019s because you let me. There is no substance to it. You\u2019ve given it to me. I haven\u2019t earned it for myself.\u201d\n\u201cAny strike or throw you make against me is earned,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if I offer it to you. But I understand. There is something to be said for honest competition.\u201d\nI started to say something else, but she put her hand over my mouth. \u201cI\u2019ve said I understand. Stop fighting after you have won.\u201d Hand still over my mouth, she tapped a finger thoughtfully. \u201cVery well. Continue your progress and I will find you someone at your own level to fight.\u201d", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN\nHeight\nI WAS ALMOST BEGINNING TO feel comfortable in Haert. My language was improving and I felt less isolated now that I was able to exchange brief pleasantries with others. Vashet occasionally shared meals with me, helping me feel like slightly less of a pariah.\nWe had done sword-work this morning, which meant an easy start to the day. Vashet was still showing me how the sword was incorporated into the Ketan, and the moments we fought were few and far between. After a few hours of this, we worked on my Ademic, then more sword-work.\nAfter lunch, we moved on to hand fighting. I couldn\u2019t help but feel that here, at least, I was progressing well. After half an hour, not only was Vashet breathing harder, but she began to sweat a bit. I was still no sort of challenge to her, of course, but after days of humiliating nonchalance on her part, she was finally having to put forth a shred of effort to keep ahead of me.\nSo we continued to fight, and I noticed that\u2014How can I say this delicately ? She smelled wonderful. Not like perfume or flowers or anything like that. She smelled like clean sweat and oiled metal and crushed grass from when I\u2019d thrown her to the ground some time before. It was a good smell. She . . .\nI can\u2019t describe this delicately, I suppose. What I mean to say is that she smelled like sex. Not as if she\u2019d been having it, as if she was made of it. When she came in close to grapple me, the smell of her combined with her body pressing against mine ... For a second it was like someone had thrown a switch in my head. All I could think of was kissing her mouth, biting the soft skin of her neck, tearing at her clothes and licking the sweat off her\u2014\nI did none of these things, of course. But at the moment I wanted nothing more. This is embarrassing to look back on, but I will not bother defending myself except to point out that I was in the full flower of my youth, fit and healthy. And she was quite an attractive woman, though ten years my senior.\nAdd to this the simple fact that I had gone from the loving arms of Felurian, to the eager arms of Losine, and from thence to a long, barren", "stretch of training with Tempi as we traveled to Haert. That meant for three span, I had been constantly exhausted, anxious, confused, and terrified by turns.\nNow I was none of these things. Vashet was a good teacher and made sure I was well-rested and relaxed as possible. I was growing more confident in my abilities and more comfortable around her.\nGiven all of this, it\u2019s no great surprise I had the reaction I did.\nAt the time, however, I was startled and embarrassed as only a young man can be. I stepped away from Vashet, blushing and fumbling an apology. I tried to hide my obvious arousal, and in doing so only drew more attention to it.\nVashet looked down at what my hands were trying vainly to conceal. \u201cWell then, I suppose I will take that as a compliment and not a curious new avenue of attack.\u201d\nIf a person could die from shame, I would have.\n\u201cWould you like to take care of it yourself?\u201d Vashet asked easily. \u201cOr would you prefer a partner?\u201d\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d I said stupidly.\n\u201cCome now.\u201d She gestured to my hands. \u201cEven if you could keep your mind away from that, it would doubtless throw your balance off.\u201d She gave a low, throaty chuckle. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to tend to it before we continue your lessons. I can leave you to it, or we can find a soft spot and see who can pin the other best two of three.\u201d\nThe casual tone of her voice convinced me I\u2019d misunderstood her. Then she gave me a knowing smirk, and I realized I\u2019d understood her perfectly well.\n\u201cWhere I come from, a teacher and a student would never . . .\u201d I stumbled, trying to think of a polite way to defuse the situation.\nVashet rolled her eyes at me, the exasperated expression looking odd on an Adem face. \u201cDo your teachers and students also never fight? Never talk? Never eat together?\u201d\n\u201cBut this,\u201d I said, \u201cThis . . .\u201d\nShe sighed. \u201cKvothe, you need to remember. You come from a barbarous place. Much of what you grew up thinking is quite wrongheaded and foolish. None of it as much as the strange customs you barbarians have built around your sexplay.\u201d\n\u201cVashet,\u201d I said. \u201cI . . .\u201d", "She cut me off with a sharp gesture. \u201cWhatever you are about to say, I have doubtless heard before from my poet king. But there are only so many hours of light in the day. So I ask you this: are you desirous of sex?\u201d\nI gave a helpless shrug, knowing it would be pointless to deny it. \u201cWould you like to have sex with me?\u201d\nI could still smell her. At that moment, I wanted it more than anything.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cAre you free of disease?\u201d she asked seriously.\nI nodded, too off balance to be startled by the frankness of the question. \u201cVery well then. If I remember correctly, there is a nice patch of moss out\nof the wind not too far from here.\u201d She began to walk up a nearby hill, her fingers working the buckle that fastened her sword\u2019s scabbard over her shoulder. \u201cCome with me.\u201d\nHer memory did serve her well. Two trees arched their branches over a thick bed of soft moss that was snugged up against a small stony bluff, sheltered from the wind by some convenient bushes.\nIt quickly became obvious that what Vashet had in mind was not an afternoon of twining idly in the shade. To say she was businesslike would be a great disservice to her, as Vashet\u2019s laughter always ran very close to the surface. But she was not flirtatious or coy.\nShe stripped off her mercenary reds without the least fanfare or teasing, revealing a few scars, and a body hard and lean and corded with muscle. Which isn\u2019t to say that she wasn\u2019t also round and soft as well. Then she teased me for staring as if I\u2019d never seen a naked woman before, when the truth was I\u2019d simply never seen one standing full naked in the sunlight.\nWhen I didn\u2019t undress fast enough to suit her, Vashet laughed and mocked my bashfulness. Stepping close, she stripped me naked as a plucked chicken, then kissed me on the mouth, her warm skin pressing against the entire front of my body.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never kissed a woman my own height before,\u201d I mused when we stopped for a breath. \u201cIt\u2019s a different experience.\u201d\n\u201cSee how I continue to be your teacher in all things?\u201d she said. \u201cYour next lesson is this: all women are the same height lying down. The same cannot be said for your sort, of course. Too much depends on a man\u2019s mood and his natural gifts.\u201d\nVashet took my hand and brought us both to lie on the soft moss. \u201cThere,\u201d she said. \u201cAs I suspected. Now you are taller than me. Does this set you at", "your ease?\u201d It did.\nI was prepared for things to be awkward after Vashet and I returned from the bushes, and was surprised to find they were nothing of the sort. She did not suddenly grow flirtatious, which I wouldn\u2019t have known how to cope with. Neither did she feel obliged to treat me with any newfound tenderness. This became clear somewhere around the fifth time she managed to lure me off my guard, catch me with Thunder Upward, and throw me roughly to the ground.\nIn all, she acted as if nothing odd at all had happened. Which meant either nothing odd had happened or something very odd had happened and she was pointedly ignoring it.\nWhich meant that everything was lovely, or everything was going terribly wrong.\nLater, as I ate supper alone, I rolled what I knew of the Adem around in my head. No nudity taboo. They didn\u2019t consider physical contact particularly intimate. Vashet had been very casual both before, during, and after our encounter.\nI thought back to the naked couple I had stumbled onto several days ago. They had been startled, but not embarrassed.\nSex was viewed differently here, obviously. But I didn\u2019t know any of the specific differences. That meant I didn\u2019t have the first idea of how to conduct myself properly. And that meant what I was doing was dangerous as walking around blind. More like running blind, really.\nNormally if I had a question about the Adem culture, I asked Vashet. She was my touchstone. But I could imagine too many ways for that conversation to go astray, and her goodwill was all that stood between me and the loss of my fingers.\nBy the time I finished eating, I\u2019d decided it would be best to simply follow Vashet\u2019s lead. She was my teacher, after all.\n \nCHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN\nBarbarian Cunning\nTHE DAYS PASSED QUICKLY, as days tend to do when there is much to fill them. Vashet continued to teach me, and I turned the whole of my attention toward being a clever and attentive student.\nOur amorous encounters continued, punctuating my training. I never initiated them directly, but Vashet could tell when I was unproductively distracted and was quick to pull me down into the bushes. \u201cIn order to clear your foolish barbarian head,\u201d as she said.\nBefore and afterward I still found these encounters troubling. During, however, I was far from anxious. Vashet seemed to enjoy herself as well.\nThat said, she didn\u2019t seem the least interested in much of what I had learned from Felurian. She had no interest in playing ivy, and while she did enjoy thousand hands, she had little patience for it, and it usually ended up being more like seventy-five hands. Generally speaking, as soon as we had caught our breath, Vashet was tying on her mercenary reds and reminding me that if I kept forgetting to turn my heel out, I would never be able to hit any harder than a boy of six.\nNot all my time was spent training with Vashet. When she was busy, she set me to practice the Ketan, consider the Lethani, or watch the other students spar.\nThere were a few afternoons or evenings when Vashet simply sent me on my way. So I explored the surrounding town and discovered Haert was much larger than I\u2019d originally assumed. The difference was that all its houses and shops weren\u2019t huddled together in a knot. They were scattered over several square miles of rocky hillside.\nI found the baths early on. By which I mean, I was pointedly directed there\n \nby Vashet with instructions to wash off my barbarian stink.\nThey were a marvel. A sprawling stone building built on the top of what I\nguessed was either a natural hot spring or some marvelously engineered plumbing. There were large rooms full of water and small rooms full of steam. Rooms with deep pools for soaking, and rooms with great brass tubs for scrubbing. There was even one room with a pool big enough for swimming.\nAll through the building, the Adem mingled without any regard for age, gender, or state of undress. This didn\u2019t surprise me nearly as much as it would have a month ago, but it still took a great deal of getting used to.\nAt first I found it hard not to stare at the breasts of the naked women. Then, when some of that novelty faded, I found it hard not to stare at the scars that crossed the bodies of mercenaries. It was easy to tell who had taken the red even when their clothes were off.\nRather than fight my urge to gawk, I found it easier to go early in the morning or late at night when the baths were largely empty. Coming and going at odd hours wasn\u2019t difficult, as there was no lock on the door. It was open at all hours for anyone to use. Soap and candles and towels were available for the taking. The baths, Vashet told me, were maintained by the school.\nI found the smithy by following the noise of ringing iron. The man working there was pleasantly talkative. He was glad to show me his tools and tell me the names for them in Ademic.\nOnce I knew to look, I saw there were signs above the doors of the stores. Pieces of wood carved or painted to show what was sold inside: bread, herbs, barrel staves.... None of the signs had words, which was fortunate for me, as I had no idea how to read Ademic.\nI visited an apothecary where I was told I was not welcome, and a tailor where I was greeted warmly. I spent some of the three royals I\u2019d stolen to buy two new sets of clothes, as those I had with me were showing their miles. I bought shirts and pants in muted colors after the local fashion, hoping they might help me fit in just a little better.\nI also spent many hours watching the sword tree. At first I did this under Vashet\u2019s direction, but before long I found myself drawn back when I had time of my own to spend. Its motions were hypnotic, comforting. At times it seemed the branches wrote against the sky, spelling the name of the wind.", " True to her word, Vashet found me a sparring partner.\n\u201cHer name is Celean,\u201d Vashet told me over breakfast. \u201cYour first meeting\nwill be at the sword tree at midday. You should take this morning to prepare yourself however you think is best.\u201d\nAt last. A chance to prove myself. A chance to match wits with someone at my own level of skill. A real contest.\nI was at the sword tree early, of course, and when I first saw them approaching, I had a moment of confused panic when I thought the small figure at Vashet\u2019s side was Penthe, the woman who had beaten Shehyn.\nThen I realized it couldn\u2019t be Penthe. The figure approaching with Vashet was short, but the wind revealed a straight, lean body with none of Penthe\u2019s curves. What\u2019s more, the figure wore a shirt of bright cornsilk yellow, not mercenary red.\nI fought down a stab of disappointment, even though I knew it was foolish. Vashet had said she had found a fair fight for me. Obviously it couldn\u2019t be someone who had already taken the red.\nThey came closer still, and my excitement guttered and died.\nIt was a little girl. Not even a young girl of fourteen or so. It was a little girl, no more than ten by my best guess. She was skinny as a twig and so short her head barely made it up to my breastbone. Her grey eyes were huge in her tiny face.\nI was humiliated. The only thing that kept me from crying out in protest was the fact that I knew Vashet would find it unspeakably rude.\n\u201cCelean, this is Kvothe,\u201d Vashet said in Ademic.\nThis young girl looked me up and down appraisingly, then took an unconscious half-step closer. A compliment. She considered me enough of a threat that she wanted to be close enough to strike at me if necessary. It was closer than an adult would have stood, because she was shorter.\nPolite greeting, I gestured.\nCelean returned my gesture. It might have been my imagination, but it seemed the angle of her hands implied polite nonsubordinate greeting.\nIf Vashet saw it, she made no comment. \u201cIt is my desire that the two of you fight.\u201d\nCelean looked me over again, her narrow face set in the typical Adem impassivity. The wind blew at her hair, and I could see a half-healed cut", "running from above her eyebrow up into her hairline.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d the girl asked calmly. She didn\u2019t seem afraid. It sounded more as\nif she couldn\u2019t think of the least reason she would want to fight me. \u201cBecause there are things you can learn from each other,\u201d Vashet said.\n\u201cAnd because I say you will.\u201d\nVashet gestured to me: Attend. \u201cCelean\u2019s Ketan is quite exceptional. She\nhas years of experience, and is easily the match of any two girls her size.\u201d Vashet tapped Celean on the shoulder twice. Caution. \u201cKvothe, on the\nother hand, is new to the Ketan and has much to learn. But he is stronger than you, and taller, with a better reach. He also possesses a barbarian\u2019s cunning.\u201d\nI looked at Vashet, unsure if she were poking fun at me or not.\n\u201cAlso,\u201d Vashet continued to Celean, \u201cyou will very likely have your mother\u2019s height when you are grown, so you should practice fighting those larger than yourself.\u201d Attend. \u201cLastly, he is new to our language, and for this you will not mock him.\u201d\nThe girl nodded. I noticed Vashet hadn\u2019t specified I couldn\u2019t be mocked for other reasons.\nVashet straightened and spoke formally. \u201cNothing with the intention to injure.\u201d She held up fingers, marking the rules she had taught me when we started hand fighting. \u201cYou may strike hard, but not viciously. Be careful of the head and neck, and nothing at all toward the eyes. You are each responsible for the other\u2019s safety. If one of you gains a solid submission against the other, do not attempt to break it. Signal fairly and count it the end of the bout.\u201d\n\u201cI know this,\u201d Celean said. Irritation.\n\u201cIt bears repeating,\u201d Vashet said. Stern rebuke. \u201cLosing a fight is forgivable. Losing your temper is not. This is why I have brought you here instead of some little boy. Did I choose wrongly?\u201d\nCelean looked down. Apologetic regret. Embarrassed acceptance.\nVashet addressed us both. \u201cInjuring another through carelessness is not of the Lethani.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t see how my beating up a ten-year-old girl was of the Lethani either, but I knew better than to say so.\nAnd with that, Vashet left us alone, walking to a stone bench some forty feet away where another woman in mercenary reds was sitting. Celean made a complicated gesture I didn\u2019t recognize toward Vashet\u2019s back.\nThen the young girl turned to face me, looking me up and down. \u201cYou are", "the first barbarian I have fought,\u201d she said after a long moment. \u201cAre you all red?\u201d She lifted her hand to her own hair to clarify her meaning.\nI shook my head. \u201cNot many of us.\u201d\nShe hesitated, then reached out her hand. \u201cCan I touch it?\u201d\nI almost smiled at this, but caught myself. I ducked my head a bit and bent\ndown so she could reach.\nCelean ran her hand through my hair, then rubbed some between her\nthumb and forefinger. \u201cIt\u2019s soft.\u201d She gave a little laugh. \u201cBut it looks like metal.\u201d\nShe let go of my hair and stepped back to a formal distance again. She gestured polite thanks, then brought up her hands. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d\nI nodded uncertainly, bringing up my own hands.\nI wasn\u2019t ready. Celean darted forward, catching me flat-footed. Her arm drove out in a punch straight toward my groin. Raw instinct made me crouch so it struck my stomach instead.\nLuckily, by this point I knew how to take a punch, and a month of hard training had made my stomach a sheet of muscle. Still, it felt like someone had thrown a rock at me, and I knew I\u2019d have a bruise by dinner.\nI got my feet under me and flicked an exploratory kick at her. I wanted to see how skittish she was, and hoped to make her back away so I could get my balance settled and make better use of my longer reach.\nIt turned out Celean wasn\u2019t skittish at all. She didn\u2019t back away. Instead she slipped alongside my leg and struck me squarely in the thick knot of muscle directly above the knee.\nBecause of this I couldn\u2019t help but stagger when my foot came back down, leaving me off balance with Celean close enough to climb me if she wanted. She set her hands together, braced her feet, and struck me with Threshing Wheat. The force of it knocked me over backward.\nGiven the thick grass, it wasn\u2019t a hard landing. I rolled to get some distance and came back to my feet. Celean chased me and made Thrown Lightning. She was fast, but I had longer legs, and managed to back away or block everything she threw. She faked a kick and I fell for it, giving her the opportunity to hit me right above the knee in the same place as before.\nIt hurt, but I didn\u2019t stagger this time, instead stepping sideways and away. Still she followed me, relentless and overeager. And in her haste she left an opening.\nBut despite the bruises and the fall she\u2019d already given me, I couldn\u2019t bring", "myself to throw a punch at such a tiny girl. I knew how solidly I could hit Tempi or Vashet. But Celean was such a tiny twig of a thing. I worried I would hurt her. Hadn\u2019t Vashet said we were responsible for each other\u2019s safety?\nSo instead I grabbed her with Climbing Iron. My left hand missed, but the long, strong fingers of my right hand wrapped all the way around her slender wrist. I didn\u2019t have her in the proper submission, but now it was a game of strength, and I couldn\u2019t help but win. I already had her wrist, all that remained was to grip her shoulder and I\u2019d have her in Sleeping Bear before\u2014\nCelean made Break Lion. But it wasn\u2019t the version I had learned. Hers used both hands, striking and twisting so quickly that my hand was stinging and empty before I could think. Then she grabbed my wrist and pulled, lashing out to kick my leg in a fluid motion. I leaned, buckled, and she stretched me out flat above the ground.\nThis landing wasn\u2019t soft, more a jarring flop onto the grass. It didn\u2019t completely stun me, but that didn\u2019t matter because Celean simply reached out and tapped my head twice. Signaling that if she\u2019d wanted to, she could easily have knocked me unconscious.\nI rolled into a sitting position, aching in several places and with a sprained pride. It wasn\u2019t badly sprained though. My time with Tempi and Vashet had taught me to appreciate skill, and Celean\u2019s Ketan truly was excellent.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen that version of Break Lion before,\u201d I said.\nCelean grinned. It was only a small grin, but it still showed a glimpse of her white teeth. In the world of Adem impassivity, it was like the sun coming from behind a cloud. \u201cThat is mine,\u201d she said. Extreme pride. \u201cI made it. I am not strong enough to use regular Break Lion against my mother or anyone your size.\u201d\n\u201cWould you show it to me?\u201d I asked.\nCelean hesitated, then nodded and stepped forward, holding out her hand. \u201cGrab my wrist.\u201d\nI took hold of it, gripping firmly but not fiercely.\nShe did it again, like a magic trick. Both of her hands moved in a flurry of motion, and I was left with a stinging, empty hand.\nI reached out again. Amusement. \u201cI have slow barbarian eyes. Could you make it again so I can learn it?\u201d\nCelean stepped back, shrugging. Indifference. \u201cAm I your teacher? Should I give something of mine to a barbarian who cannot even strike me in a", "fight?\u201d She lifted her chin and looked off toward the spinning sword tree, but her eyes darted back to me, playfully.\nI chuckled and came to my feet, bringing up my hands again.\nShe laughed and turned to face me. \u201cGo!\u201d\nThis time I was ready, and I knew what Celean was capable of. She was no\nsort of delicate flower. She was quick and fearless and aggressive.\nSo I went on the offensive, taking advantage of my long arms and legs. I\nstruck out with Dancing Maiden, but she skipped away. No. It would be better to say she slid away from me, never compromising her balance in the least, her feet weaving smoothly through the long grass.\nThen she changed directions suddenly, catching me between steps and slightly off my stride. She feigned a punch at my groin, then pushed me slightly off balance with Turning Millstone. I staggered but managed to keep my feet beneath me.\nI tried to regain my balance, but she brushed me again with Turning Millstone, then again. And again. Each time only shoving me a few inches, but it kept me in a helpless stumbling retreat until she managed to plant her foot behind mine, tripping me and sending me flat onto my back.\nBefore I\u2019d finished striking the ground she already had hold of my wrist, and soon had my arm tangled firmly in Ivy on the Oak. This pressed my face into the grass while putting uncomfortable pressure against my wrist and shoulder.\nFor a second I considered trying to struggle free, but only for a second. I was stronger than she was, but the whole point of positions like Ivy on the Oak and Sleeping Bear is to put pressure on the fragile parts of the body. You did not need a great deal of strength to attack the branch.\n\u201cI submit,\u201d I said. This is easier to say in Ademic: Veh. An easy noise to make when you are winded, tired, or in pain. I\u2019d become rather used to saying it lately.\nCelean let go of me and stepped away, watching as I sat up.\n\u201cYou really aren\u2019t very good,\u201d she said with brutal honesty.\n\u201cI am not used to striking young girls,\u201d I said.\n\u201cHow could you become used to it?\u201d She laughed. \u201cTo grow used to a\nthing, you must do it over and again. I expect you have never struck a woman even once.\u201d\nCelean extended a hand. I took it in what I hoped was a gracious manner, and she helped pull me to my feet. \u201cI mean where I come from, it is not right", "to fight with women.\u201d\n\u201cI do not understand,\u201d she said. \u201cDo they not let the men fight in the same\nplace as the women?\u201d\n\u201cI mean, for the most part, our women do not fight,\u201d I explained.\nCelean rolled her wrist over, opening and closing her hand as if there were\nsome dirt on the palm and she was absentmindedly trying to rub it off. It was the hand-talk equivalent of puzzlement, a confused frown of sorts. \u201cHow do they improve their Ketan if they do not practice?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cWhere I come from, the women have no Ketan at all.\u201d\nHer eyes narrowed, then brightened. \u201cYou mean to say they have a secret Ketan,\u201d she said, using the Aturan word for \u201csecret.\u201d Though her face was composed, her body vibrated with excitement. \u201cA Ketan only they know, that the men are not allowed to see.\u201d\nCelean pointed over to the bench where our teachers sat ignoring us. \u201cVashet has such a thing. I have asked her to show it to me many times, but she will not.\u201d\n\u201cVashet knows another Ketan?\u201d I asked.\nCelean nodded. \u201cShe was schooled in the path of joy before she came to us.\u201d She looked over at her, her face serious, as if she would pull the secret out of the other woman by sheer force of will. \u201cSomeday I will go there and learn it. I will go everywhere, and I will learn all the Ketans there are. I will learn the hidden ways of the ribbon and the chain and of the moving pool. I will learn the paths of joy and passion and restraint. I will have all of them.\u201d\nWhen she spoke, Celean didn\u2019t say this in a tone of childish fancy, as if she were daydreaming of eating an entire cake. Neither was she boastful, as if she were describing a plan she had put together on her own and thought very clever.\nCelean said it with a quiet intensity. It was almost as if she were simply explaining who she was. Not to me. She was telling herself.\nShe turned back to look at me. \u201cI will go to your land too,\u201d she said. Absolute . \u201cAnd I will learn the barbarian Ketan your women keep secret from you.\u201d\n\u201cYou will be disappointed,\u201d I said. \u201cI did not misspeak. I know the word for secret. What I meant to say is that where I come from, many women do not fight.\u201d\nCelean rolled her wrist again in puzzlement, and I knew I had to be more clear. \u201cWhere I come from, most women spend their whole lives without", "holding a sword. Most grow up not knowing how to strike another with a fist or the blade of their hand. They know nothing of any sort of Ketan. They do not fight at all.\u201d I stressed the last two words with strong negation.\nThat finally seemed to get the point across to her. I had half expected her to look horrified, but instead she simply stood there blankly, hands motionless, as if at a loss for what to think. It was as if I\u2019d just explained to her that the women where I came from didn\u2019t have any heads.\n\u201cThey do not fight?\u201d she asked dubiously. \u201cNot with the men or with each other or with anyone at all?\u201d\nI nodded.\nThere was a long, long pause. Her brow furrowed and I could actually see her struggling to come to grips with this idea. Confusion. Dismay. \u201cThen what do they do?\u201d she said at last.\nI thought of the women I knew: Mola, Fela, Devi. \u201cMany things,\u201d I said, having to improvise around the words I didn\u2019t know. \u201cThey make pictures out of stones. They buy and sell money. They write in books.\u201d\nCelean seemed to relax as I recited this list, as if relieved to hear these foreign women, empty of any Ketan, weren\u2019t strewn around the countryside like boneless corpses.\n\u201cThey heal the sick and mend wounds. They play ...\u201d I almost said play music and sing songs, but caught myself in time. \u201cThey play games and plant wheat and make bread.\u201d\nCelean thought for a long moment. \u201cI would rather do those things and fight as well,\u201d she said decisively.\n\u201cSome women do, but for many it is considered not of the Lethani.\u201d I used the phrase \u201cof the Lethani\u201d because I could not think of how to say \u201cproper behavior\u201d in Ademic.\nCelean gestured sharp disdain and reproach. I was amazed how much more it stung coming from this young girl in her bright yellow shirt than it ever had from Tempi or Vashet. \u201cThe Lethani is the same everywhere,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cIt is not like the wind, changing from place to place.\u201d\n\u201cThe Lethani is like water,\u201d I responded without thinking. \u201cIt is itself unchanging, but it shapes itself to fit all places. It is both the river and the rain.\u201d\nShe glared at me. It was not a furious glare, but coming from one of the Adem, it had the same effect. \u201cWho are you to say the Lethani is like one thing and not another?\u201d", "\u201cWho are you to do the same?\u201d\nCelean looked at me for a moment, the hint of a serious line between her pale eyebrows. Then she laughed brightly and brought up her hands. \u201cI am Celean,\u201d she proclaimed. \u201cMy mother is of the third stone. I am Adem born, and I am the one who will throw you to the ground.\u201d\nShe was as good as her word.", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN\nPurpose\nVASHET AND I FOUGHT, moving back and forth across the foothills of Ademre.\nAfter all this time, I barely noticed the wind anymore. It was as much a part of the landscape as the uneven ground beneath my feet. Some days it was gentle, and did little more than make patterns in the grass or flick my hair into my eyes. Other days it was strong enough to make the loose fabric of my clothes crack and snap against my skin. It could come at you from unexpected directions without a moment\u2019s warning, pushing you as firmly as a hand between your shoulder blades.\n\u201cWhy do we spend so much time on my hand fighting?\u201d I asked Vashet as I made Picking Clover.\n\u201cBecause your hand fighting is sloppy,\u201d Vashet said, blocking me with Fan Water. \u201cBecause you embarrass me every time we fight. And because three times of four you lose to a child half your size.\u201d\n\u201cBut my sword fighting is even worse,\u201d I said as I circled, looking for an opening.\n\u201cIt is worse,\u201d she acknowledged. \u201cThat is why I do not let you fight anyone but me. You are too wild. You could hurt someone.\u201d\nI smiled. \u201cI thought that was the point of this.\u201d\nVashet frowned, then reached out casually to grip my wrist and shoulder, twisting me into Sleeping Bear. Her right hand held my wrist over my head, stretching my arm at an awkward angle, while her left pressed firmly against my shoulder. Helpless, I was forced to bend at the waist, staring at the ground.\n\u201cVeh,\u201d I said in submission.\nBut Vashet didn\u2019t release me. She twisted, and the pressure against my shoulder increased. The small bones of my wrist began to ache.\n\u201cVeh,\u201d I said a little louder, thinking she hadn\u2019t heard me. But still she held me, twisting a little harder at my wrist. \u201cVashet?\u201d I tried to turn my head", "to look at her, but from this angle all I could see was her leg.\n\u201cIf the point of this is to hurt someone,\u201d she said, \u201cwhy should I let you\ngo?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant . . .\u201d Vashet pushed down harder, and I stopped\ntalking.\n\u201cWhat is the purpose of Sleeping Bear?\u201d she asked calmly.\n\u201cTo incapacitate your opponent,\u201d I said.\n\u201cVery well.\u201d Vashet began to bear down with the slow, relentless force of\na glacier. Dull pain began to build in my shoulder as well as my wrist. \u201cSoon your arm will be twisted from the cup of your shoulder. Your tendons will stretch and pull free of the bone. Your muscles will tear and your arm will hang like a wet rag at your side. Then will Sleeping Bear have served its purpose?\u201d\nI struggled a bit out of pure animal instinct. But it only turned the burning pain into something sharper, and I stopped. Over the course of my training, I had been put into inescapable positions before. Every time I had been helpless, but this was the first time I had truly felt that way.\n\u201cThe purpose of Sleeping Bear is control,\u201d Vashet said calmly. \u201cRight now, you are mine to do with as I wish. I can move you, or break you, or let you free.\u201d\n\u201cI would prefer free,\u201d I said, trying to sound more hopeful than desperate.\nThere was a pause. Then she asked, calmly, \u201cWhat is the purpose of Sleeping Bear?\u201d\n\u201cControl.\u201d\nI felt her hands release me, and I stood, slowly rolling my shoulder to ease the ache.\nVashet stood there, frowning at me. \u201cThe point of all of this is control. First you must have control of yourself. Then you can gain control of your surroundings. Then you gain control of whoever stands against you. This is the Lethani.\u201d\nAfter the better part of a month in Haert, I could not help but feel that things were going well. Vashet acknowledged that my language was improving, congratulating me by saying I sounded like a child, rather than just an\n \nimbecile.\nI continued to meet with Celean in the grassy field next to the sword tree. I\nlooked forward to these encounters despite the fact that she thrashed me with cheerful ruthlessness every time we fought. It took three days before I finally managed to beat her.\nThat\u2019s an interesting verse to add to the long story of my life, isn\u2019t it?\nCome listen all, and I will tell\nA tale of brave and daring deeds.\nOf wonders Kvothe the Bloodless wrought, And of the time he bravely fought\nA twigling girl no more than ten.\nAnd listen how it came to pass,\nThe mighty blow he bravely dealt\nThat knocked her sprawling to the grass, And of the glow of joy he felt.\nAwful as it might sound, I was proud. And justifiably so. Celean herself congratulated me when it happened, seeming more than a little surprised that I had managed it. There, in the long shadow of the sword tree, she showed me her two-handed variant of Breaking Lion as a reward, flattering me with the familiarity of an impish grin.\nThat same day we finished our prescribed number of bouts early. I went to sit on a nearby lump of stone that had been smoothed into a comfortable seat. I nursed my dozen small hurts from the fight and prepared to watch the sword tree until Vashet returned to fetch me.\nCelean, however, was not the sort to sit and wait. She skipped over to the sword tree, standing only a few feet from where the longest branches bobbed and danced in the wind, sending the round, razor-sharp leaves turning in wild circles.\nThen she lowered her shoulders and darted under the canopy, in among the thousand madly spinning leaves.\nI was too startled to cry out, but I did come halfway to my feet before I heard her laughing. I watched as she darted and jigged and spun, her tiny body dodging out of the way of the wind-tossed leaves as if she were playing tag. She made it halfway to the trunk and stopped. She ducked her head, reached out, and swatted away a leaf that otherwise would have cut her.", "No. She didn\u2019t just lash out. She used Drifting Snow. Then I watched her move even closer to the trunk, weaving back and forth and protecting herself. First she used Maiden Combs Her Hair, then Dance Backwards.\nThen she skipped to one side, the Ketan abandoned. She crouched and sprinted through a gap in the leaves and made her way to the trunk of the tree, slapping it with one hand.\nAnd she was back among the leaves. She made Pressing Cider, ducked and spun and ran until she was clear of the canopy. She didn\u2019t shout out in triumph as a Commonwealth child might have, but she jumped into the air, hands raised in victory. Then, still laughing, she did a cartwheel.\nBreathless, I watched Celean play her game again and again, moving in and out of the tree\u2019s dancing leaves. She didn\u2019t always make it to the trunk. Twice she scampered back out of the reach of the leaves without making it, and it was obvious even from where I sat that she was angry. Once she slipped and was forced to crawl out under the reach of the leaves.\nBut she made it to the trunk and back four times, each time celebrating her escape with upraised hands, laughter, and a single perfect cartwheel.\nShe only stopped when Vashet returned. I watched from a distance as Vashet stormed over and gave the girl a stern telling off. I couldn\u2019t hear what was said, but their body language spoke volumes. Celean looked down and shuffled her feet. Vashet shook a finger and cuffed the young girl on the side of her head. It was the same scolding any child receives. Stay out of the neighbor\u2019s garden. Don\u2019t tease the Bentons\u2019 sheep. Don\u2019t play tag among the thousand spinning knives of your people\u2019s sacred tree.", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN\nHands\nONCE VASHET JUDGED MY language only moderately embarrassing, she arranged for me to talk with an odd handful of people scattered around Haert.\nThere was a garrulous old man who spun silk thread while chattering endlessly, telling strange, pointless, half-delirious stories. There was a story of a boy who put shoes on his head to keep a cat from being killed, another where a family swore to eat a mountain stone by stone. I could never make any sense of them, but I listened politely and drank the sweet beer he offered me.\nI met with twin sisters who made candles and showed me the steps of strange dances. I spent an afternoon with a woodcutter who spoke for hours of nothing but splitting wood.\nAt first I thought these were important members of the community. I thought Vashet might be parading me in front of them in order to show how civilized I had become.\nIt wasn\u2019t until I spent the morning with Two-fingers that I realized she sent me to each of these people with the hope I would learn something.\nTwo-fingers was not his real name. I\u2019d merely come to think of him as that. He was a cook at the school, and I saw him at every meal. His left hand was whole, but his right was viciously crippled, with only his thumb and forefinger remaining.\nVashet sent me to him in the morning, and together we prepared lunch and talked. His name was Naden. He told me he had spent ten years among the barbarians. What\u2019s more, he had brought more than two hundred and thirty silver talents back into the school before he was injured and could no longer fight. He mentioned the last several times, and I could tell that it was a particular point of pride with him.\nThe bells rang and folk filtered into the dining hall. Naden ladled up the stew we\u2019d made, hot and thick with chunks of beef and carrot. I cut slices of warm white bread for those who wanted it. I exchanged nods and occasional", "polite gestures with those who moved through the line. I was careful to make only the briefest eye contact, and tried to convince myself it was just a coincidence so few people seemed interested in bread today.\nCarceret made a show of her feelings for everyone to see. First she made it to the front of the line, then made a widely visible gesture of abhorrent disgust before walking away, leaving her wooden plate behind.\nLater Naden and I tended to the washing up. \u201cVashet tells me your swordplay is progressing poorly,\u201d he said without preamble. \u201cShe says you fear too much for your hands, and this makes you hesitant.\u201d Firm reproach.\nI froze at the abruptness of it, fighting the urge to stare at his ruined hand. I nodded, not trusting myself to speak.\nHe turned from the iron pot he was scrubbing and held out his hand in front of him. It was a defiant gesture, and his face was hard. I looked then, as ignoring it would be rude. Only his thumb and forefinger remained, enough to grip at things, but not enough for any delicate work. The half of his hand that remained was a mass of puckered scar.\nI kept my face even, but it was hard. In some ways I was looking at my worst fear. I felt very self-conscious of my uninjured hands and fought the urge to make a fist or hide them behind my back.\n\u201cIt has been a dozen years since this hand held a sword,\u201d Naden said. Proud anger. Regret. \u201cI have thought long on that fight where my fingers were lost. I did not even lose them to a skilled opponent. They fell to some barbarian whose hands were better suited to a shovel than the sword.\u201d\nHe flexed his two fingers. In some ways, he was lucky. There were other Adem in Haert who were missing entire hands, or eyes, or limbs to the elbow or knee.\n\u201cI have thought a long time. How could I have saved my hand? I have thought about my contract, protecting a baron whose lands were in rebellion. I think: What if I had not taken that contract? I think: What if I had lost my left hand? I could not talk, but I could hold a sword.\u201d He let his hand drop to his side. \u201cBut holding a sword is not enough. A proper mercenary requires two hands. I could never make Lover out the Window or Sleeping Bear with only one. . . .\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cIt is the luxury of looking backward. You can do it forever, and it is useless. I took the red proudly. I brought over two hundred and thirty talents to the school. I was of the second stone, and I would have made the third in time.\u201d", "Naden held up his ruined hand again. \u201cI could have gained none of these things if I had lived in fear of losing my hand. If I flinched and cringed, I would never have been accepted into the Latantha. Never made the second stone. I would be whole, but I would be less than I am now.\u201d\nHe turned back and began to scrub the pots again. After a moment I joined him.\n\u201cIs it bad?\u201d I asked quietly, unable to help myself.\nNaden didn\u2019t answer for a long moment. \u201cWhen it first happened, I thought to myself it was not so bad. Others have had worse wounds. Others have died. I was luckier than them.\u201d\nHe drew in a deep breath, then let it out slowly. \u201cI tried to think it was not bad. My life would continue on. But no. Life stops. Much is lost. Everything is lost.\u201d\nThen he said, \u201cWhen I dream, I have two hands.\u201d\nWe finished the dishes together, sharing silence between us. Sometimes that is all you can share.\nCelean had a lesson of her own to teach me. Namely that there are opponents who will not hesitate to punch, kick, or elbow a man directly in his genitals.\nNever hard enough to permanently injure me, mind you. She\u2019d been fighting her entire young life and had the control Vashet valued so highly. But that meant she knew exactly how hard to strike to leave me stunned and reeling, making her victory utterly unquestionable.\nSo I sat on the grass, feeling grey and nauseous. After incapacitating me, Celean had given me a comforting pat on the shoulder before skipping blithely away. No doubt going to dance among the wind-tossed branches of the sword tree again.\n\u201cYou were doing well until the end,\u201d Vashet said, lowering herself onto the ground across from me.\nI said nothing. Like a child playing find-and-catch, it was my sincere hope that if I closed my eyes and remained perfectly still, the pain wouldn\u2019t be able to find me.\n\u201cCome now, I saw her kick,\u201d Vashet said dismissively. \u201cIt was not so hard as that.\u201d I heard her sigh. \u201cStill, if you need someone to look at them and\n \nmake sure they are still intact. . . .\u201d\nI chuckled slightly. It was a mistake. Unbelievable pain uncoiled in my\ngroin, radiating down to my knee and up to my sternum. Nausea rolled over me, and I opened my eyes to steady myself.\n\u201cShe will grow out of it,\u201d Vashet said.\n\u201cI should hope so,\u201d I said through gritted teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s a noxious habit.\u201d \u201cThat is not what I meant,\u201d Vashet said. \u201cI mean she will grow taller.\nHopefully then she will distribute her attentions more evenly across the body. Right now she attacks the groin too regularly. It makes her easy to predict and defend against.\u201d She gave me a pointed look. \u201cTo anyone with a shred of wit.\u201d\nI closed my eyes again. \u201cNo lessons right now, Vashet,\u201d I begged. \u201cI\u2019m ready to vomit up yesterday\u2019s breakfast.\u201d\nShe climbed to her feet. \u201cIt sounds like the perfect time for a lesson. Stand up. You should learn how to fight while wounded. This is an invaluable skill Celean has given you the chance to practice. You should thank her.\u201d\nKnowing it was pointless to argue, I climbed to my feet and began to walk gingerly toward my training sword.\nVashet caught me by the shoulder. \u201cNo. Hands only.\u201d\nI sighed. \u201cMust we, Vashet?\u201d\nShe raised an eyebrow at me. \u201cMust we what?\u201d\n\u201cMust we focus always on hand fighting?\u201d I said. \u201cMy swordplay is falling\nfarther and farther behind.\u201d\n\u201cAm I not your teacher?\u201d she asked. \u201cWho are you to say what is best?\u201d \u201cI am the one who will have to use these skills out in the world,\u201d I said\npointedly. \u201cAnd out in the world, I would rather fight with a sword than a fist.\u201d\nVashet lowered her hands, her expression blank. \u201cAnd why is that?\u201d\n\u201cBecause other people have swords,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd if I\u2019m in a fight, I intend to win.\u201d\n\u201cIs winning a fight easier with a sword?\u201d she asked.\nVashet\u2019s outward calm should have warned me I was stepping onto thin conversational ice, but I was distracted by the nauseating pain radiating from my groin. Though honestly, even if I hadn\u2019t been distracted, it\u2019s possible I wouldn\u2019t have noticed. I had grown comfortable with Vashet, too comfortable to be properly careful.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy else carry a sword?\u201d", "\u201cThat is a good question,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy does one carry a sword?\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you carry anything? So you can use it.\u201d\nVashet gave me a look of raw disgust. \u201cWhy do we bother to work on your\nlanguage, then?\u201d She asked angrily, reaching out to grab my jaw, pinching my cheeks and forcing my mouth open as if I were a patient in the Medica refusing my medicine. \u201cWhy do you need this tongue if a sword will do? Tell me that?\u201d\nI tried to pull away, but she was stronger than me. I tried to push her away, but she shrugged my flailing hands away as if I were a child.\nVashet let go of my face, then caught my wrist, jerking my hand up in front of my face. \u201cWhy do you have hands at all and not knives at the ends of your arms?\u201d\nThen she let go of my wrist and struck me hard across the face with the flat of her hand.\nIf I say she slapped me, you will take the wrong impression. This wasn\u2019t the dramatic slap of the sort you see on a stage. Neither was it the offended, stinging slap a lady-in-waiting makes against the smooth skin of a too- familiar nobleman. It wasn\u2019t even the more professional slap of a serving girl defending herself from the unwelcome attention of a grabby drunk.\nNo. This was hardly any sort of slap at all. A slap is made with the fingers or the palm. It stings or startles. Vashet struck me with her open hand, but behind that was the strength of her arm. Behind that was her shoulder. Behind that was the complex machinery of her pivoting hips, her strong legs braced against the ground, and the ground itself beneath her. It was like the whole of creation striking me through the flat of her hand, and the only reason it didn\u2019t cripple me is that even in the middle of her fury, Vashet was always perfectly in control.\nBecause she was in control, Vashet didn\u2019t dislocate my jaw or knock me unconscious. But it made my teeth rattle and my ears ring. It made my eyes roll in my head and my legs go loose and shaky. I would have fallen if Vashet hadn\u2019t gripped me by the shoulder.\n\u201cDo you think I am teaching you the secrets of the sword so you can go out and use them?\u201d she demanded. I dimly realized she was shouting. It was the first time I had ever heard one of the Adem raise their voice. \u201cIs that what you think we are doing here?\u201d\nAs I lolled in her grip, stupefied, she struck me again. This time her hand caught more of my nose. The pain of it was amazing, as if someone had", "driven a sliver of ice directly into my brain. It jolted me out of my daze so I was fully alert when she hit me the third time.\nVashet held me for a moment while the world spun, then let go. I took one unsteady step and crumpled to the ground like a puppet with its strings cut. Not unconscious, but profoundly dazed.\nIt took me a long time to collect myself. When I was finally able to sit up, my body felt loose and unwieldy, as if it had been taken apart and put back together again in a slightly different way.\nBy the time I gathered my wits enough to look around, I was alone.", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY\nKindness\nTWO HOURS LATER I sat alone in the dining hall. My head ached, and the side of my face was hot and swollen. I\u2019d bitten my tongue at some point, so it hurt to eat and everything tasted of blood. My mood was exactly what you might imagine, except worse.\nWhen I saw a red form slide onto the bench across from me, I dreaded looking up. If it was Carceret, it would be bad. But Vashet would be even worse. I had waited until the dining hall was almost empty before coming to eat, hoping to avoid them both.\nBut glancing up, I saw it was Penthe, the fierce young woman who had beaten Shehyn.\n\u201cHello,\u201d she said in lightly accented Aturan.\nI gestured, polite formal greeting. Considering the way my day was going, I thought it best to be as careful as possible. Vashet\u2019s comments led me to believe Penthe was a high-ranking and well-respected member of the school.\nFor all that, she wasn\u2019t very old. Perhaps it was her small frame or her heart-shaped face, but she didn\u2019t look much more than twenty.\n\u201cCould we speak your language?\u201d she asked in Aturan. \u201cIt would be a kindness. I am in need of practice with my talking.\u201d\n\u201cI will gladly join you,\u201d I said in Aturan. \u201cYou speak very well. I am jealous. When I speak Ademic, I feel I am a great bear of a man, stomping around in heavy boots.\u201d\nPenthe gave a small, shy smile, then covered her mouth with her hand, blushing slightly. \u201cIs that correct, to smile?\u201d\n\u201cIt is correct, and polite. A smile such as that shows a small amusement. Which is perfect, as mine was a very small joke.\u201d\nPenthe removed her hand and repeated the shy smile. She was charming as spring flowers. It eased my heart to look at her.\n\u201cNormally,\u201d I said, \u201cI would smile in answer to yours. But here, I worry others would view it as impolite.\u201d", "\u201cPlease,\u201d she said, making a series of gestures wide enough for anyone to see. Bold invitation. Imploring entreaty. Familiar welcome. \u201cI must practice.\u201d\nI smiled, though not quite as widely as I would have ordinarily. Partly out of caution, and partly because my face hurt. \u201cIt feels good to smile again,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI have anxiousness about my smiling.\u201d She started to gesture and stopped herself. Her expression shifted, her eyes narrowing a bit, as if she were irritated.\n\u201cThis?\u201d I asked, gesturing mild worry.\nShe nodded. \u201cHow do you make that with the face?\u201d\n\u201cIt is like this,\u201d I drew my brows together slightly. \u201cAlso, as a woman, you\nwould do this,\u201d I pursed my lips slightly. \u201cI would do this, as I am a man.\u201d I drew my lips down into a small frown instead.\nPenthe looked at me blankly. Aghast. \u201cIt is different for men and women?\u201d she asked, disbelief creeping into her tone.\n\u201cOnly some,\u201d I reassured her. \u201cAnd only small things.\u201d\n\u201cThere is so much,\u201d she said, allowing a note of despair into her voice. \u201cWith one\u2019s family one knows what every small movement of face means. You grow up watching. You know the all of what is in them. Those friends you are young with, before you know better than to grin at everything. It is easy with them. But this . . .\u201d She shook her head. \u201cHow can one possibly remember when to correctly show one\u2019s teeth? How often am I supposed to touch eyes?\u201d\n\u201cI understand,\u201d I said. \u201cI am very good at speaking in my language. I can make the cleverest meanings. But here that is useless.\u201d I sighed. \u201cKeeping my face still is very hard. I feel I am always holding my breath.\u201d\n\u201cNot always,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not always still of the face. When you are with . . .\u201d She trailed off, then quickly gestured, apology.\n\u201cI have none I am close to,\u201d I said. Gentle regret. \u201cI had hoped I was growing close to Vashet, but I fear I ruined that today.\u201d\nPenthe nodded. \u201cI saw.\u201d She reached out and ran her thumb along the side of my face. It felt cool against the swelling. \u201cYou must have angered her very.\u201d\n\u201cI can tell that by the ringing of my ears,\u201d I said.\nPenthe shook her head. \u201cNo. Your marks.\u201d She gestured to her own face this time. \u201cWith another, it might be a mistake, but Vashet would not leave such if she did not wish everyone to see.\u201d", "The bottom dropped out of my stomach and my hand went unconsciously to my face. Of course. This wasn\u2019t mere punishment. It was a message to all of Ademre.\n\u201cFool that I am,\u201d I said softly. \u201cI did not realize this until now.\u201d\nWe ate quietly for several minutes, before I asked, \u201cWhy did you come to sit with me today?\u201d\n\u201cWhen I saw you today, I thought I had heard many people speak about you. But I knew nothing of you from personal knowing.\u201d A pause.\n\u201cAnd what do others say?\u201d I said with a small, wry smile.\nShe reached out to touch the corner of my mouth with her fingertips. \u201cThat,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is the bent smile?\u201d\nGentle mocking, I gestured in explanation. \u201cBut of myself, not you. I can guess what they say.\u201d\n\u201cNot all is bad,\u201d she said gently.\nPenthe looked up at me and met my eyes then. They were huge in her small face, slightly darker grey than usual. They were so bright and clear that when she smiled, the sight of it almost broke my heart. I felt tears well up in my eyes and I quickly looked down, embarrassed.\n\u201cOh!\u201d she said softly, and gestured a hurried distressed apology. \u201cNo. I am wrong with my smiling and eye touching. I meant this.\u201d Kind encouragement.\n\u201cYou are right with your smiling,\u201d I said without looking up, blinking furiously in an attempt to clear the tears away. \u201cIt is an unexpected kindness on a day when I do not deserve such a thing. You are the first to speak with me from your own desire. And there is a sweetness in your face that hurts my heart.\u201d I made gratitude with my left hand, glad that I didn\u2019t need to meet her eyes to show her how I felt.\nHer left hand crossed the table and caught hold of mine. Then she turned my hand face up and pressed comfort softly into my palm.\nI looked up and gave her what I hoped was a reassuring smile.\nShe mirrored it almost exactly, then covered her mouth again. \u201cI maintain anxiousness about my smiling.\u201d\n\u201cYou should not. You have the perfect mouth for smiling.\u201d\nPenthe looked up at me again, her eyes meeting mine for a heartbeat before darting away. \u201cTrue?\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cIn my own language, it is a mouth I would write a\u2014\u201d I brought myself up short, sweating a bit when I realized I\u2019d almost said \u201csong.\u201d", "\u201cPoem?\u201d she suggested helpfully.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cIt is a smile worthy of a poem.\u201d\n\u201cMake one then,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my language.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cIt would be a bear\u2019s poem. Too clumsy for you.\u201d This just seemed to spur her on, and her eyes grew eager. \u201cDo. If it is\nclumsy, it will make me feel better of my own stumbling.\u201d\n\u201cIf I do,\u201d I threatened, \u201cyou must, too. In my language.\u201d\nI\u2019d thought this would scare her away, but after only a moment\u2019s hesitation\nshe nodded.\nI thought of the only Ademic poetry I had heard: a few snippets from the\nold silk spinner and the piece from the story Shehyn had told about the archer. It wasn\u2019t much to go on.\nI thought of the words I knew, the sounds of them. I felt the absence of my lute sharply here. This is why we have music, after all. Words cannot always do the work we need them to. Music is there for when words fail us.\nFinally I looked around nervously, glad there were only a scattered handful of people left in the dining hall. I leaned toward her and said:\nDouble-weaponed Penthe\nNo sword in hand,\nHer flower-mouth curves,\nAnd cuts a heart a dozen steps away.\nShe gave the smile again, and it was just as I said. I felt the sharpness of it in my chest. Felurian had had a beautiful smile, but it was old and knowing. Penthe\u2019s smile was bright as a new penny. It was like cool water on my dry, tired heart.\nThe sweet smile of a young woman. There is nothing better in the world. It is worth more than salt. Something in us sickens and dies without it. I am sure of this. Such a simple thing. How strange. How wonderful and strange.\nPenthe closed her eyes for a moment, her mouth moving silently as she chose the words of her own poem.\nThen she opened her eyes and spoke in Aturan.\nBurning as a branch,\nKvothe speaks.\nBut the mouth that threatens boots", "reveals a dancing bear.\nI smiled wide enough to make my face hurt. \u201cIt is lovely,\u201d I said honestly. \u201cIt is the first poem anyone has ever made for me.\u201d\nAfter my conversation with Penthe, I felt considerably better. I was uncertain as to whether or not we had been flirting, but that hardly mattered. It was enough for me to know there was at least one person in Haert who didn\u2019t want me dead.\nI walked to Vashet\u2019s house as I usually did after meals. Half of me hoped she would greet me, smiling and sarcastic, the morning\u2019s unpleasantness put wordlessly behind us. The other half of me feared she would refuse to speak with me at all.\nAs I came over the rise, I saw her sitting on a wooden bench outside her door. She leaned against the rough stone wall of her house, as if she were merely enjoying the afternoon sun. I drew a deep breath and let it out, feeling myself relax.\nBut as I came closer, I saw her face. She was not smiling. Neither did she wear the impassive Adem mask. She watched me approach, her expression hangman grim.\nI spoke as soon as I came close enough. \u201cVashet,\u201d I said earnestly. \u201cI\u2019m \u2014\u201d\nStill sitting, Vashet held up her hand, and I stopped speaking as quickly as if she had struck me across the mouth. \u201cApology now is of little consequence,\u201d she said, her voice flat and chill as slate. \u201cAnything you say at this point cannot be trusted. You know I am well and truly angry, so you are in the grip of fear.\n\u201cThis means I cannot trust any word you say, as it comes from fear. You are clever, and charming, and a liar. I know you can bend the world with your words. So I will not listen.\u201d\nShe shifted her position on the bench, then continued. \u201cEarly on I noticed a gentleness in you. It is a rare thing in one so young, and it was a large piece of what convinced me you were worth teaching. But as the days pass, I glimpse something else. Some other face that is far from gentle. I have\n \ndismissed these as flickers of false light, thinking them the brags of a young man or the odd jokes of a barbarian.\n\u201cBut today as you spoke, it came to me that the gentleness was the mask. And this other half-seen face, this dark and ruthless thing, that is the true face hiding underneath.\u201d\nVashet gave me a long look. \u201cThere is something troubling inside you. Shehyn has seen it in your conversations. It is not a lack of the Lethani. But this makes my unease more, not less. That means there is something in you deeper than the Lethani. Something the Lethani cannot mend.\u201d\nShe met my eye. \u201cIf this is the case, then I have been wrong to teach you. If you have been clever enough to show me a false face for so long, then you are a danger to more than just the school. If this is the case, then Carceret is right, and you should be killed swiftly for the safety of everyone involved.\u201d\nVashet came to her feet, moving as if she were very tired. \u201cThis I have thought today. And I will continue to think for long hours tonight. Tomorrow I will have decided. Take this time to order your thoughts and make whatever preparations seem best to you.\u201d\nThen, without meeting my eye, she turned and went into her house, closing the door silently behind her.\nFor a while, I wandered aimlessly. I went to watch the sword tree, hoping I might find Celean there, but she was nowhere to be seen. Watching the tree itself did nothing to soothe me. Not today.\nSo I went to the baths, where I soaked myself joylessly. Afterward, in one of the mirrors scattered through the smaller rooms, I caught the first glimpse of my face since Vashet had struck me. Half my face was red and swollen, with bruises beginning to mottle blue and yellow around my temple and the line of my jaw. I also had the raw beginnings of a profoundly blackened eye.\nAs I stared at myself in the mirror I felt a low anger flicker to life deep in my belly. I was, I decided, tired of waiting helplessly while others decided whether I could come or go. I had played their game, learned their language, been unfailingly polite, and in return I had been treated like a dog. I had been beaten, sneered at, and threatened with death and worse. I was finished with it.\n \nSo I made my way slowly around Haert. I visited the twin sisters, the talkative smithy, and the tailor where I had bought my clothes. I chatted amiably, passing the time, asking questions, and pretending I didn\u2019t look as if someone had beaten me unconscious a handful of hours ago.\nMy preparations took a long time. I missed dinner, and the sky was growing dark by the time I came back to the school. I went straight to my room and closed the door behind me.\nThen I emptied the contents of my pockets onto my bed, some purchased, some stolen. Two fine, soft beeswax candles. A long shard of brittle steel from a poorly forged sword. A spool of blood-red thread. A small stoppered bottle of water from the baths.\nI closed my fist tightly around the last. Most people don\u2019t understand how much heat water holds inside it. That is why it takes so long to boil. Despite the fact that the scalding-hot pool I had pulled this from was more than half a mile away, what I held in my hand was of better use to a sympathist than a glowing coal. This water had fire in it.\nI thought of Penthe with a twinge of regret. Then I picked up a candle and began to turn it in my hands, warming it with my skin, softening the wax and beginning to shape a doll of it.\nI sat in my room, thinking dark thoughts as the last of the light faded from the sky. I looked over the tools I had gathered and knew deep in my gut that sometimes a situation grows so tangled that words are useless. What other option did I have, now that words had failed me?\nWhat do any of us have when words fail us?", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-ONE\nWhen Words Fail\nIT WAS WELL INTO the dark hours of night when I approached Vashet\u2019s house, but there was candlelight flickering in her window. I didn\u2019t doubt she would have me killed or crippled for the good of all Ademre, but Vashet was nothing if not careful. She would give it a long night\u2019s thought beforehand.\nEmpty-handed, I knocked softly on her door. After a moment, she opened it. She still wore her mercenary reds, but she had removed most of the silk ties that held it tight to her body. Her eyes were tired.\nHer mouth thinned when she saw me standing there, and I knew if I spoke she would refuse to listen. So I gestured entreaty and stepped backward, out of the candlelight and into the dark. I knew her well enough by this point to be sure of her curiosity. Her eyes narrowed suspiciously as I stepped away, but after a moment\u2019s hesitation she followed me. She did not bring her sword.\nIt was a clear night, and we had a piece of moon to light our way. I led us up into the hills, away from the school, away from the scattered houses and shops of Haert.\nWe walked more than a mile before we came to the place I had chosen. A small grove of trees where a tall jumble of stone would keep any noise from carrying back toward the sleeping town.\nThe moonlight slanted in through the trees, revealing dark shapes in a tiny clear space tucked among the stones. There were two small wooden benches here. I took gentle hold of Vashet\u2019s arm and guided her to sit.\nMoving slowly, I reached into the deep leeward shadow of a nearby tree and brought out my shaed. I draped it carefully over a low-hanging branch so it hung like a dark curtain between us.\nThen I sat on the other bench, bent, and worked the clasps on my lute case. As each of them snapped open, the lute within made a familiar harmonic thrum, as if eager to be free.\nI brought it out and gently began to play.\nI had tucked a piece of cloth inside the bowl of the lute to soften the sound,", "not wanting it to carry over the rocky hills. And I had woven some of the red thread between the strings. Partly to keep them from ringing too brightly, and partly out of a desperate hope that it might bring me luck.\nI began with \u201cIn the Village Smithy.\u201d I did not sing, worried Vashet would be offended if I went that far. But even without the words, it is a song that sounds like weeping. It is music that speaks of empty rooms and a chill bed and the loss of love.\nWithout pausing, I moved on to \u201cViolet Bide,\u201d then \u201cHome Westward Wind.\u201d The last had been a favorite of my mother\u2019s, and as I played it I thought of her and began to cry.\nThen I played the song that hides in the center of me.That wordless music that moves through the secret places in my heart. I played it carefully, strumming it slow and low into the dark stillness of the night. I would like to say it is a happy song, that it is sweet and bright, but it is not.\nAnd, eventually, I stopped. The tips of my fingers burned and ached. It had been a month since I had played for any length of time, and they had lost their calluses.\nLooking up, I saw Vashet had pulled my shaed aside and was watching me. The moon hung behind her, and I could not see the expression on her face.\n\u201cThis is why I do not have knives instead of hands, Vashet,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cThis is what I am.\u201d", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-TWO\nLeaving\nTHE NEXT MORNING I woke early, ate quickly, and was back in my room before most of the school was stirring in their beds.\nI shouldered my lute and travelsack. I wrapped my shaed around me, checking that everything I needed was properly stowed in my pockets: red string, wax mommet, brittle iron, vial of water. Then I drew up the hood of my shaed and left the school, making my way to Vashet\u2019s house.\nVashet opened the door between my second and third knock. She was shirtless, and stood bare-breasted in the doorway. She eyed me pointedly, taking note of my cloak, my travelsack, my lute.\n\u201cIt is a morning for visitors,\u201d she said. \u201cCome in. The wind is chill this early.\u201d\nI stepped inside and tripped on the threshold, stumbling so that I had to rest my hand on Vashet\u2019s shoulder to steady myself. My hand caught clumsily in her hair as I did so.\nVashet shook her head as she closed the door behind me. Unconcerned with her near-nakedness, she reached both her hands behind her head and began to plait half of her hanging hair into a short, tight braid.\n\u201cThe sun was barely in the sky this morning when Penthe knocked on my door,\u201d she said conversationally. \u201cShe knew I was angry with you. And though she did not know what you had done, she spoke on your behalf.\u201d\nHolding the braid with one hand, Vashet reached for a piece of red string and tied it off. \u201cThen, almost before my door had time to close, Carceret paid me a visit. She congratulated me on finally giving you the treatment you deserve.\u201d\nShe reached back to braid the other side of her hair, her fingers twisting nimbly. \u201cBoth of them irritated me. They had no place speaking to me about my student.\u201d\nVashet tied off the second braid. \u201cThen I thought to myself, whose opinion do I respect more?\u201d She looked at me, making it a question for me to answer.", "\u201cYou respect your own opinion more,\u201d I said.\nVashet smiled widely. \u201cYou are exactly right. But Penthe is not entirely a fool either. And Carceret can be angry as a man when the mood is on her.\u201d\nShe picked up a long piece of dark silk and wound it around her torso, over her shoulders and across her naked breasts, supporting and holding them close to her chest. Then she tucked the end of the cloth into itself and it somehow remained tightly secured. I had seen her do this several times before, but how it actually worked was still a mystery to me.\n\u201cAnd what have you decided?\u201d I asked.\nShe shrugged her blood-red shirt over her head. \u201cYou are still a puzzle,\u201d she said. \u201cGentle and troubling and clever and foolish.\u201d Her head emerged from the shirt and she gave me a serious look. \u201cBut someone who breaks a puzzle because they cannot solve it has left the Lethani. I am not such a one.\u201d\n\u201cI am glad,\u201d I said. \u201cI would not have enjoyed leaving Haert.\u201d\nVashet raised an eyebrow at that. \u201cI daresay you would not.\u201d She gestured at the lute case that hung over my shoulder. \u201cLeave that here, or people will talk. Leave your bag too. You can take them back to your room later.\u201d\nShe looked at me speculatively. \u201cBut bring the cloak. I will show you how to fight while wearing it. Such things can be useful, but only if you can avoid tripping over them.\u201d\nI went back to my training almost as if nothing had happened. Vashet showed me how to avoid tripping over my own cloak. How it could be used to bind a weapon or disarm the unwary. She commented on it being very fine, strong, and durable, but never seemed to note anything unusual about it.\nDays passed. I continued to spar with Celean and eventually learned to protect my precious manhood from all forms of uncouth attack. Slowly, I grew skilled enough that we were nearly even in our bouts, trading victories back and forth.\nThere were even a handful of conversations with Penthe at mealtimes, and I was glad to have one other person willing to occasionally smile in my direction.\nBut I was no longer at my ease in Haert. I had come too close to disaster. Whenever I spoke to Vashet I thought twice about every word. Some words I\n \nthought about three times.\nAnd while Vashet seemed to return to her familiar wry and smiling self, I\nwould catch her watching me from time to time, her face grim, her eyes intent.\nAs the days passed, the tension between us gradually wore away, fading as slowly as the bruises on my face. I like to think eventually it would have disappeared entirely. But we were not given enough time for that.\nIt came like lightning from the clear blue sky.\nVashet opened her door to my knock. But instead of coming outside, she\nstood in the doorway. \u201cTomorrow is your test,\u201d she said.\nFor a second, I didn\u2019t understand what she was talking about. I had been\nfocusing so intently on my sword practice, my sparring with Celean, the language, the Lethani. I had almost forgotten the purpose of it all.\nI felt a rush of excitement in my chest, followed by a chill knot in my stomach. \u201cTomorrow?\u201d I said stupidly.\nShe nodded, smiling faintly at my expression.\nHer subdued response did little to set me at my ease. \u201cSo soon?\u201d \u201cShehyn feels it would be best. If we wait another month, there could be\nearly snow, keeping you from going freely on your way.\u201d\nI hesitated, then said, \u201cYou aren\u2019t telling me the whole truth, Vashet.\u201d Another faint smile and a small shrug. \u201cYou\u2019re right in that, though\nShehyn does think waiting is unwise. You are charming, in your clumsy barbarian way. The longer you are here, the more folk will come to feel kindly toward you....\u201d\nI felt the chill settle deeper into my gut. \u201cAnd if I am to be mutilated, it would be better if it were done before more folk realize I\u2019m actually a real person and not some faceless barbarian,\u201d I said harshly, though not as harshly as I wanted to.\nVashet looked down, then nodded. \u201cYou would not have heard. But Penthe blackened Carceret\u2019s eye two days ago in an argument about you. Celean too, has grown fond of you, and talks to the other children. They watch you from the trees while you train.\u201d She was still for a moment. \u201cAnd there are others.\u201d\nI knew enough after all this time to read Vashet\u2019s small silence for what it\n \nreally meant. Suddenly her muted mood, her stillness made much better sense.\n\u201cShehyn must attend to the best interests of the school,\u201d Vashet said. \u201cShe must decide according to what is right. She cannot allow herself to be swayed by the fact that some few are fond of you. At the same time, if she makes a correct decision and many in the school resent it, that is not good either.\u201d Another shrug. \u201cSo.\u201d\n\u201cAm I ready?\u201d\nVashet was quiet for a long time. \u201cThat\u2019s not an easy question,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing invited to the school isn\u2019t merely a matter of skill. It is a test of fit, of suitability. If one of us fails, we can try again. Tempi took his test four times before he was admitted. For you there will only be one chance.\u201d She looked up at me. \u201cAnd ready or not, it is time.\u201d", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-THREE\nThe Spinning Leaf\nTHE NEXT MORNING VASHET came to collect me just as I was finishing my breakfast. \u201cCome,\u201d she said. \u201cCarceret has been praying for a storm all night, but it\u2019s only gusting.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t know what that meant, but I didn\u2019t feel like asking either. I returned my wooden plate and turned around to find Penthe standing there, a slight yellowing bruise along her jawline.\nPenthe didn\u2019t say anything, merely gripped my arms in an open show of support. Then she hugged me tightly. I was surprised when her head only came up to my chest. I\u2019d forgotten how small she was. The dining room was even more quiet than normal, and while no one was staring, everyone was watching.\nVashet walked me to the tiny park where we had first met and began our usual limbering stretch. The routine of it relaxed me, lulling my anxiety to a dull rumble. When we were finished,Vashet led me down into the hidden valley of the sword tree. I wasn\u2019t surprised. Where else would the test take place?\nThere were a dozen people scattered in the open field around the tree. Most of them were dressed in mercenary reds, but I saw three wearing lighter clothes. I guessed they were important members of the community, or perhaps retired mercenaries still involved with the school.\nVashet pointed toward the tree. At first I thought she was drawing my attention to the motion of it. It was, as she had said, a rather blustery day, and the branches lashed wildly at the empty air. Then I saw a glint of metal against its trunk. Looking more closely, I could see a sword there, tied to the trunk of the tree.\nI thought of Celean dancing among the sharp leaves to slap the trunk of the tree. Of course.\n\u201cThere are several items around the base of the tree,\u201dVashet said. \u201cYour test is to go in, choose one, and bring it out again.\u201d", "\u201cThis is the test?\u201d I demanded. It came out a little sharper than I\u2019d planned. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ask?\u201d she countered dryly, then laid her hand gently on my arm. \u201cI would have,\u201d she said. \u201cEventually. But I knew if I told you too soon, you would try your hand at it and hurt yourself.\u201d\n\u201cWell thank God we saved that for today,\u201d I said, then sighed. Resigned apology . \u201cWhat happens if I go in there and get cut to ribbons?\u201d\n\u201cGetting cut is usually a given,\u201d she said and pulled aside the neck of her shirt, revealing a pair of familiar pale, thin scars on her shoulder. \u201cThe question is how much, and where, and how you behave.\u201d She shrugged her shirt back into place. \u201cThe leaves will not cut deep, but be careful of your face and neck. The places where vessels and tendons are close to the surface. A cut on your chest or arm can be mended easily. Less so a severed ear.\u201d\nI watched the tree as it caught a gust of wind, branches flailing madly. \u201cWhat keeps a person from crawling there on hands and knees?\u201d\n\u201cPride,\u201d she said, her eyes searching my face. \u201cWill you be known as the one who crawled during his test?\u201d\nI nodded. This was an issue for me especially. As a barbarian, I had twice as much to prove.\nI looked at the tree again. It was thirty feet from the edge of the lashing branches to the trunk. I thought back to the scars I\u2019d seen on Tempi\u2019s body, on Carceret\u2019s face. \u201cSo this is a test of nerve,\u201d I said. \u201cA test of pride.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a test of many things,\u201d Vashet said. \u201cYour behavior signifies a great deal. You could throw your arms over your face and rush ahead. The straightest line is quickest, after all. But what does that reveal of you? Are you a bull that charges blindly? Are you an animal without subtlety or grace?\u201d She shook her head, frowning. \u201cI expect better from a student of mine.\u201d\nI squinted my eyes, trying to see what other items were gathered around the tree. \u201cI suppose I\u2019m not allowed to ask what the proper choice is.\u201d\n\u201cThere are many proper choices, and many more improper ones. It is different for everyone. The item you bring back reveals much. What you do with the item afterward reveals much. How you comport yourself reveals much.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cAll these things Shehyn will consider before deciding if you are to be admitted into the school.\u201d\n\u201cIf Shehyn is the one to decide, why are all these others here?\u201d\nVashet forced a smile, and I saw anxiety lurking deep in her eyes. \u201cShehyn", "does not embody the entire school herself.\u201d She gestured to the distant Adem standing around the sword tree. \u201cLess does she represent the entirety of the path of the Latantha.\u201d\nI looked around and realized the handful of non-red shirts were not light, but white. These were the heads of other schools. They had traveled here to see the barbarian take his test.\n\u201cIs this usual?\u201d I asked.\nVashet shook her head. \u201cI could feign ignorance. But I suspect Carceret spread word.\u201d\n\u201cCan they overrule Shehyn\u2019s decision?\u201d I asked.\nVashet shook her head. \u201cNo. It is her school, her decision. No one would dispute her right to make it.\u201d At her side, her hand flicked. However.\n\u201cVery well,\u201d I said.\nVashet reached out and gripped my hand in both of hers, squeezed it, then let it fall.\nI walked to the sword tree. For a moment the wind eased, and the thick canopy of hanging branches reminded me of the tree where I had met the Cthaeh. It was not a comforting thought.\nI watched the spinning leaves, trying not to think of how sharp they were. How they would slice into the meat of me. How they could glide through the thin skin of my hands and slice through the delicate tendons underneath.\nFrom the edge of the canopy to the safety of the trunk couldn\u2019t be more than thirty feet. In some ways, not very far at all....\nI thought of Celean darting wildly through the leaves. I thought of her, jumping and swatting branches away. If she could do it, then certainly so could I.\nBut even as I thought it, I knew it simply wasn\u2019t true. Celean had played here all her life. She was skinny as a twig, quick as a cricket, and half my size. Compared to her, I was a lumbering bear.\nI saw a handful of Adem mercenaries on the far side of the tree. Two of the more intimidating white shirts were there as well. I could feel their eyes on me, and in a strange way, I was glad.\nWhen you\u2019re alone, it\u2019s easy to be afraid. It\u2019s easy to focus on what might be lurking in the dark at the bottom of the cellar steps. It\u2019s easy to obsess on unproductive things, like the madness of stepping into a storm of spinning knives. When you\u2019re alone it\u2019s easy to sweat, panic, fall apart . . .\nBut I wasn\u2019t alone. And it wasn\u2019t just Vashet and Shehyn watching me.", "There were a dozen mercenaries and the heads of other schools besides. I had an audience. I was onstage. And there is nowhere in the world I am more comfortable than on a stage.\nI waited just outside the reach of the longest branches, watching for a break in their motion. I hoped their random spinning would, just for a moment, open into a path I could dart through, striking away any leaves that came too close. I could use Fan Water to keep them away from my face.\nI stood at the edge of the canopy and watched, waiting for an opening, trying to anticipate the pattern. The motion of the tree lulled me like it had so many times before. It was beautiful, all circles and arcs.\nAs I watched, gently dazed by the motion of the tree, I felt my mind slip lightly into the clear, empty float of Spinning Leaf. I realized the motion of the tree wasn\u2019t random at all, really. It was actually a pattern made of endless changing patterns.\nAnd then, my mind open and empty, I saw the wind spread out before me. It was like frost forming on a blank sheet of window glass. One moment, nothing. The next, I could see the name of the wind as clearly as the back of my own hand.\nI looked around for a moment, marveling in it. I tasted the shape of it on my tongue and knew if desired I could stir it to a storm. I could hush it to a whisper, leaving the sword tree hanging empty and still.\nBut that seemed wrong. Instead I simply opened my eyes wide to the wind, watching where it would choose to push the branches. Watching where it would flick the leaves.\nThen I stepped under the canopy, calmly as you would walk through your own front door. I took two steps, then stopped as a pair of leaves sliced through the air in front of me. I stepped sideways and forward as the wind spun another branch through the space behind me.\nI moved through the dancing branches of the sword tree. Not running, not frantically batting them away with my hands. I stepped carefully, deliberately. It was, I realized, the way Shehyn moved when she fought. Not quickly, though sometimes she was quick. She moved perfectly, always where she needed to be.\nAlmost before I realized it, I was standing on the dark earth that circled the wide trunk of the sword tree. The spinning leaves could not reach here. Safe for the moment, I relaxed and focused on what was waiting there for me.\nThe sword I had seen from the edge of the clearing was bound to the tree", "with a white silk cord that ran around the trunk. The sword was half-drawn from its sheath, and I could see the blade was similar to Vashet\u2019s sword. The metal was an odd, burnished grey without mark or blemish.\nNext to the tree on a small table sat a familiar red shirt, folded neatly in half. There was an arrow with stark white fletching and a polished wooden cylinder of the sort that would hold a scroll.\nA bright glitter caught my eye, and I turned to see a thick gold bar nestled in the dark earth among the roots of the tree. Was it truly gold? I bent and touched it. It was chill under my fingers, and was too heavy for my single hand to pry up from the ground. How much did it weigh? Forty pounds? Fifty? Enough gold for me to stay at the University forever, no matter how viciously they raised my tuition.\nI slowly made my way around the trunk of the sword tree and saw a fluttering piece of silk hanging from a low branch. There was another sword of a more ordinary sort, hanging from the same white cord. There were three blue flowers tied with a blue ribbon. There was a tarnished Vintish halfpenny. There was a long, flat whetstone, dark with oil.\nThen I came to the other side of the tree and saw my lute case leaning casually against the trunk.\nSeeing it there, knowing someone had gone into my room and taken it from under my bed, filled me with a sudden, terrible rage. It was all the worse knowing what the Adem thought of musicians. It meant they knew I wasn\u2019t merely a barbarian, but a cheap and tawdry whore as well. It had been left there to taunt me.\nI had called the name of the wind in the grip of a terrible anger before, in Imre after Ambrose had broken my lute. And I had called it in terror and fury to defend myself against Felurian. But this time the knowledge of it hadn\u2019t come to me borne on the back of some strong emotion. I had slipped into it gently, the way you must reach out to catch a gently floating thistle seed.\nSo when I saw my lute, the welter of hot emotion brought me crashing out of Spinning Leaf like a sparrow struck with a stone. The name of the wind tattered to shreds, leaving me empty and blind. Looking around at the madly dancing leaves, I could see no pattern at all, only a thousand windblown razors slicing at the air.\nI finished my slow circuit of the tree with a knot of worry tightening my stomach. The presence of my lute made one thing clear. Any of these objects could be a trap someone had left for me.", "Vashet had said the test was more than what I brought back from the tree. It was also how I brought it, and what I did with it afterward. If I brought out the heavy bar of gold and gave it to Shehyn, would that show I was willing to bring money back to the school? Or it would signify that I would cling greedily to something heavy and unwieldy despite the fact that it put me in danger?\nThe same was true of any of these things. If I took the red shirt, I could be seen as either nobly striving for the right to wear it, or arrogantly presuming I was good enough to join their ranks. This was doubly true of the ancient sword that hung there. I didn\u2019t doubt that it was as precious to the Adem as a child.\nI made another slow circuit of the tree, pretending to consider my choices, but really just stalling for time. I nervously looked over the items a second time. There was a small book with a brass lock. There was a spindle of grey woolen thread. There was a smooth round stone sitting on a clean white cloth.\nAs I looked at them all, I realized any choice I made could be interpreted so many ways. I didn\u2019t know nearly enough about Adem culture to guess what my item might signify.\nEven if I did, without the name of the wind to guide me back through the canopy, I would be cut to ribbons leaving the tree. Probably not enough to maim me, but enough to make it clear I was a clumsy barbarian who obviously didn\u2019t belong.\nI looked at the gold bar again. If I chose that, at least the weight of it would give me an excuse for being awkward on my way out. Perhaps I could still make a good showing of it . . .\nNervously I made a third circuit of the tree. I felt the wind pick up, gusting and making the branches flail about more wildly than before. It pulled the sweat from my body, chilling me and making me shiver.\nIn the middle of that anxious moment, I was suddenly aware of nothing as much as the sudden, urgent pressure of my bladder. My biology cared nothing for the gravity of my situation, and I was seized with a powerful need to relieve myself.\nThus it was that in the center of a storm of knives, in the midst of my test that was also my trial, that I thought of urinating up against the side of the sacred sword tree while two dozen proud and deadly mercenaries watched me do it.\nIt was such a horrifying and inappropriate thought that I burst out laughing.", "And when the laugh rolled out of me, the tension knotting my stomach and clawing at the muscles of my back melted away. Whatever choice I made, it would have to be better than pissing on the Latantha.\nAt that moment, no longer boiling with anger, no longer gripped with fear, I looked at the moving leaves around me. Always before when the name of the wind had left me, it had faded like a dream on waking: irretrievable as an echo or a fading sigh.\nBut this time it was different, I had spent hours watching the patterns of these moving leaves. I looked out through the branches of the tree and thought of Celean jumping and spinning, laughing and running.\nAnd there it was. Like the name of an old friend that had simply slipped my mind for a moment. I looked out among the branches and I saw the wind. I spoke the long name of it gently, and the wind grew gentle. I breathed it out as a whisper, and for the first time since I had come to Haert the wind went quiet and utterly still.\nIn this place of endless wind, it seemed as if the world were suddenly holding its breath. The unceasing dance of the sword tree slowed, then stopped. As if it were resting. As if it had decided to let me go.\nI stepped away from the tree and began to walk slowly toward Shehyn, bringing nothing with me. As I walked, I raised my left hand and drew my open palm across the razor edge of a hanging leaf.\nI came to stand before Shehyn, stopping the polite distance from her. I stood, my face an impassive mask. I stood, utterly silent, perfectly still.\nI extended my left hand, bloody palm up, and closed it into a fist. The gesture meant willing.There was more blood than I\u2019d expected, and it pressed between my fingers to run down the back of my hand.\nAfter a long moment, Shehyn nodded. I relaxed, and only then did the wind return.", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FOUR\nOf Names\n\u201cYOU,\u201d VASHET SAID AS we walked through the hills, \u201care one great gaudy showboating bastard, you know that?\u201d\nI inclined my head slightly to her, gracefully gesturing subordinate acceptance.\nShe cuffed me on the side of the head. \u201cGet over yourself, you melodramatic ass.You can fool them, but not me.\u201d\nVashet held her hand to her chest as if gossiping. \u201cDid you hear what Kvothe brought back from the sword tree? The things a barbarian cannot understand: silence and stillness. The heart of Ademre. What did he offer to Shehyn? Willingness to bleed for the school.\u201d\nShe looked at me, her expression trapped between disgust and amusement. \u201cSeriously, it\u2019s like you stepped out of a storybook.\u201d\nI gestured: Gracious flattering understated affectionate acceptance. Vashet reached out and flicked my ear hard with a finger.\n\u201cOw!\u201d I burst out laughing. \u201cFine. But don\u2019t you dare accuse me of\nmelodrama. You people are one great unending dramatic gesture. The quiet. The blood-red clothes. The hidden language. Secrets and mysteries. It\u2019s like your lives are one giant dumbshow.\u201d I met her eye. \u201cAnd I do mean that in all its various clever implications.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you impressed Shehyn,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich is the most important thing. And you did it in such a way that the heads of the other schools won\u2019t be able to grumble too much. Which is the other most important thing.\u201d\nWe reached our destination, a low building of three rooms next to a small split-timber goat pen. \u201cHere is the one who will tend to your hand,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhat of the apothecary?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cThe apothecary is close friends with Carceret\u2019s mother,\u201d Vashet said. \u201cAnd I would not have her looking after your hands for a weight of gold.\u201d She nodded her head at the nearby house. \u201cDaeln, on the other hand, is who I would come to if I needed mending.\u201d", "She knocked on the door. \u201cYou may be a member of the school, but do not forget that I am still your teacher. In all things, I know what is best.\u201d\nLater, my hand tightly bandaged, Vashet and I sat with Shehyn. We were in a room I\u2019d never seen before, smaller than the rooms where we had discussed the Lethani. There was a small, messy writing desk, some flowers in a vase, and several comfortably cushioned chairs. Along one wall was a picture of three birds in flight against a sunset sky, not painted, but composed of thousands of pieces of bright enameled tile. I suspected we might be in the equivalent of Shehyn\u2019s study.\n\u201cHow is your hand?\u201d Shehyn said.\n\u201cFine,\u201d I said.\u201cIt is a shallow cut. Daeln has the smallest stitches I have ever seen. He is quite remarkable.\u201d\nShe nodded. Approval.\nI held up my left hand, wrapped in clean white linen. \u201cThe hard part will be keeping this hand idle for four days. I already feel as if it were my tongue that were cut, and not my hand.\u201d\nShehyn gave a slight smile at this, startling me. The familiarity of the expression was a great compliment. \u201cYou performed quite well today. Everyone is speaking of it.\u201d\n\u201cI expect the few that saw have better things to speak about,\u201d I said modestly.\nAmused disbelief. \u201cThat may be true, but those who watched from hiding will doubtless say what they have seen. Celean herself will have already told a hundred people unless I miss my guess. By tomorrow everyone will expect your stride to shake the ground as if you were Aethe himself come back to visit us.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t think of anything to say, so I kept quiet. A rarity for me. But as I\u2019ve said, I had been learning.\n\u201cThere is something I have been waiting to speak to you about,\u201d Shehyn said. Guarded curiosity. \u201cAfter Tempi brought you here, he told me the long story of your time together,\u201d she said. \u201cOf your search for the bandits.\u201d\nI nodded.\n\u201cIs it true that you made blood magic to destroy some men, then called\n \nlightning to destroy the rest?\u201d\nVashet looked up at this, glancing back and forth between us. I had grown\nso used to speaking Aturan with her that it was odd to see the expressionless Adem impassivity covering her face. Still, I could tell she was surprised. She hadn\u2019t known.\nI thought of trying to offer an explanation for my actions, then decided against it. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cYou are powerful then.\u201d\nI had never thought of it in those terms before. \u201cI have some power. Others are more powerful.\u201d\n\u201cIs that why you seek the Ketan? To gain power?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I seek from curiosity. I seek the knowing of things.\u201d\n\u201cKnowing is a type of power,\u201d Shehyn pointed out, then seemed to change\nthe subject. \u201cTempi told me there was a Rhinta among the bandits as their leader.\u201d\n\u201cRhinta?\u201d I asked respectfully.\n\u201cA bad thing. A man who is more than a man, yet less than a man.\u201d \u201cA demon?\u201d I asked, using the Aturan word without thinking.\n\u201cNot a demon,\u201d Shehyn said, switching easily to Aturan. \u201cThere are no\nsuch things as demons. Your priests tell stories of demons to frighten you.\u201d She met my eye briefly, gesturing a graceful: Apologetic honesty and serious import . \u201cBut there are bad things in the world. Old things in the shape of men. And there are a handful worse than all the rest. They walk the world freely and do terrible things.\u201d\nI felt hope rising within me. \u201cI have also heard them called the Chandrian,\u201d I said.\nShehyn nodded. \u201cI have heard this too. But Rhinta is a better word.\u201d Shehyn gave me a long look and fell back into Ademic. \u201cGiven what Tempi has told me of your reaction, I think that you have met such a one before.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWill you meet such a one again?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201dThe certainty in my own voice surprised me. \u201cWith purpose?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWhat purpose?\u201d\n\u201cTo kill him.\u201d\n\u201cSuch things are not easily killed.\u201d", "I nodded.\n\u201cWill you use what Tempi has taught you to do this?\u201d\n\u201cI will use all things to that purpose.\u201d I unconsciously began to gesture\nabsolute, but the bandage on my hand stopped me. I frowned at it.\n\u201cThat is good,\u201d Shehyn said. \u201cYour Ketan will not be enough. It is poor for\none as old as you are. Good for a barbarian. Good for one with as little training as you have had, but still poor overall.\u201d\nI fought hard to keep the eagerness out of my voice, wishing I could use my hand to indicate how important the question was to me. \u201cShehyn, I have a great desire to know more of these Rhinta.\u201d\nShehyn was quiet for a long moment. \u201cI will consider this,\u201d she said at last, making a gesture I thought might be trepidation. \u201cSuch things are not spoken of lightly.\u201d\nI kept my face impassive, and forced my bandaged hand to say profound respectful desire. \u201cI thank you for considering it, Shehyn. Anything you could tell me of them I would value more than a weight of gold.\u201d\nVashet gestured firm discomfort, then polite desire, difference. Two span ago I couldn\u2019t have understood, but now I realized she wanted to move the conversation onto a different subject.\nSo I bit my tongue and let it go. I knew enough about the Adem by this point to realize that pushing the issue was the worst thing to do if I wanted to learn more. In the Commonwealth I could have pressed the point, teased and wheedled it out of the person I was talking to. That wouldn\u2019t work here. Stillness and silence were the only things that would work. I had to be patient and let Shehyn return to the subject in her own time.\n\u201cI was saying,\u201d Shehyn continued. Reluctant confession.\u201cYour Ketan is poor. But were you to train yourself in proper fashion for a year, you would be Tempi\u2019s equal.\u201d\n\u201cYou flatter me.\u201d\n\u201cI do not. I tell you your weaknesses.You learn quickly. That leads to rash behavior, and rashness is not of the Lethani. Vashet is not alone in thinking there is something troubling about your spirit.\u201d\nShehyn gave me a long look. For over a minute she stared at me. Then she gave an eloquent shrug and glanced at Vashet, favoring the younger woman with a ghost of a smile. \u201cStill,\u201d Whimsical musing. \u201cif I have ever met someone without a single shadow on their heart, it was surely a child too young for speaking.\u201d She pushed herself out of her chair and brushed off her", "shirt with both hands. \u201cCome. Let us go and have a name for you.\u201d\nShehyn led the three of us up the side of a steep, rocky hill.\nNone of us had spoken since we had left the school. I didn\u2019t know what\nwas about to happen, but it didn\u2019t seem proper to ask. It would have seemed irreverent, like a groom blurting out, \u201cWhat comes next?\u201d halfway through his own wedding.\nWe came to a grassy ledge with a leaning tree clutching tight to the bare face of a cliff. Beside the tree was a thick wooden door, one of the hidden Adem homes.\nShehyn knocked and opened the door herself. Inside it wasn\u2019t cavelike at all. The stone walls were finished, and the floor was smooth wood. It was much larger than I\u2019d expected, too, with a high ceiling and six doors leading deeper into the stone of the cliff.\nA woman sat at a low table, copying something from one book into another. Her hair was white, her face wrinkled as an old apple. It occurred to me then that this was the first person I\u2019d seen reading or writing in all my time in Haert.\nThe old woman nodded a greeting at Shehyn, then turned to Vashet and her eyes crinkled around the edges. Gladness. \u201cVashet,\u201d she said. \u201cI did not know you were returned.\u201d\n\u201cWe are come for a name, Magwyn,\u201d Shehyn said. Polite formal entreaty.\n\u201cA name?\u201d Magwyn asked, puzzled. She looked from Shehyn to Vashet, then her eyes moved to where I stood behind them. To my bright red hair and my bandaged hand. \u201cAh,\u201d she said, growing suddenly somber.\nMagwyn closed her books and came to her feet. Her back was bent, and she took small, shuffling steps. She motioned me forward and walked a slow circle around me, looking me carefully up and down. She avoided looking at my face, but took hold of my unbandaged hand, turning it over to look at the palm and the fingertips.\n\u201cI would hear you say something,\u201d she said, still looking intently at my hand.\n\u201cAs you will, honored shaper of names,\u201d I said. Magwyn looked up at Shehyn. \u201cDoes he mock me?\u201d\n \n\u201cI think not.\u201d\nMagwyn made another circle of me, running her hands over my shoulders, my arms, the back of my neck. She moved her fingers through my hair, then stopped in front of me and looked me fully in the eye.\nHer eyes were like Elodin\u2019s. Not in any of the details. Elodin\u2019s eyes were green, sharp, and mocking. Magwyn\u2019s were the familiar Adem grey, slightly watery and red around the edges. No, the similarity was in how she looked at me. Elodin was the only other person I had met who could look at you like that, as if you were a book he was idly thumbing through.\nWhen Magwyn met my eyes for the first time, I felt like all the air had been sucked out of me. For the barest of moments I thought she might be startled by what she saw, but that was probably just my anxiety. I had come to the edge of disaster too often lately, and despite how well my recent test had gone, part of me was still waiting for the other shoe to drop.\n\u201cMaedre,\u201d she said, her eyes still fixed on mine. She looked down and made her way back to her book.\n\u201cMaedre?\u201dVashet said, a hint of dismay in her voice. She might have said more, but Shehyn reached out and cuffed her sharply on the side of the head. It was exactly the same motion Vashet had used to chastise me a thousand\ntimes in the last month. I couldn\u2019t help myself. I laughed.\nVashet and Shehyn glared at me. Actually glared.\nMagwyn turned to look at me. She didn\u2019t seem upset. \u201cDo you laugh at the\nname I have given you?\u201d\n\u201cNever, Magwyn,\u201d I said trying my best to gesture respect with my\nbandaged hand. \u201cNames are important things.\u201d\nShe continued to eye me. \u201cAnd what would a barbarian know of names?\u201d \u201cSome,\u201d I said, fumbling with my bandaged hand again. I couldn\u2019t add fine\nshades of meaning to my words without it. \u201cFar away, I have made a study of such things. I know more than many, but still only just a little.\u201d\nMagwyn looked at me for a long time. \u201cThen you will know you should not speak of your new name to anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a private thing, and dangerous to share.\u201d\nI nodded.\nMagwyn looked satisfied at this, and settled back onto her chair, opening a book. \u201cVashet, my little rabbit, you should come and visit me soon.\u201d Gentle chiding fondness.\n\u201cI will, grandmother,\u201d Vashet said.", "\u201cThank you, Magwyn,\u201d Shehyn said. Deferential gratitude.\nThe old woman nodded a distracted dismissal, and Shehyn led us from the cave.\nLater that evening, I walked back to Vashet\u2019s house. She was sitting on the bench out front, watching the sky as the sun began to set.\nShe tapped the bench beside her, and I took a seat. \u201cHow does it feel to no longer be a barbarian?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cMostly the same,\u201d I said. \u201cSlightly drunker.\u201d\nAfter dinner Penthe had pulled me away to her house, where there was a party of sorts. Call it a gathering, rather, as there was no music or dancing. Still, I was flattered that Penthe had gone to the effort of finding five other Adem who were willing to celebrate my admittance to the school.\nI was pleased to learn the Adem impassivity dissolved quite easily after a few drinks, and we were all grinning like barbarians in no time. It relaxed me, especially as much of my own clumsiness with the language could now be blamed on my bandaged hand.\n\u201cEarlier today,\u201d I said carefully, \u201cShehyn said she knew a story about the Rhinta.\u201d\nVashet turned to look at me, her face expressionless. Hesitant.\n\u201cI have searched all over the world for such a thing,\u201d I said.\u201cThere are few things I would value more.\u201d Utter sincerity.\u201cAnd I worry that I did a poor job of letting Shehyn know this.\u201d Questioning. Intense entreaty.\nVashet looked at me for a moment, as if waiting for me to continue. Then she gestured reluctance. \u201cI will mention it to her,\u201d she said. Reassurance. Finished.\nI nodded and let the subject drop.\nVashet and I sat for a while in companionable silence as the sun slowly sank into the horizon. She drew a deep breath and sighed expansively. I realized that, with the exception of waiting for me to catch my breath or recover from a fall, we had never done anything like this before. Up until this point, every moment we had spent together had been focused on my training.\n\u201cTonight,\u201d I said at last. \u201cPenthe told me she thought I had a fine anger, and that she\u2019d like to share it with me.\u201d\n \nVashet chuckled. \u201cThat didn\u2019t take very long.\u201d She gave me a knowing look. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\nI blushed a bit. \u201cAh. She . . . reminded me the Adem do not consider physical contact particularly intimate.\u201d\nVashet\u2019s smile grew practically lecherous. \u201cGrabbed hold of you, did she?\u201d\n\u201cAlmost,\u201d I said. \u201cI move more quickly than I did a month ago.\u201d\n\u201cI doubt you move quickly enough to keep away from Penthe,\u201d Vashet said. \u201cAll she is looking for is sexplay.There is no harm in it.\u201d\n\u201cThat is why I was asking you,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cTo see if there was any harm in it.\u201d\nVashet she raised an eyebrow, at the same time gesturing vague puzzlement.\n\u201cPenthe is quite lovely,\u201d I said carefully. \u201cHowever, you and I have . . .\u201d I looked for an appropriate term. \u201cBeen intimate.\u201d\nRealization washed over Vashet\u2019s face and she laughed again. \u201cWhat you mean is that we have been sexual. The intimacy between a teacher and student is greater by far than that.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d I said, relaxing.\u201cI\u2019d suspected something of the sort. But it is nice to know for certain.\u201d\nVashet shook her head. \u201cI had forgotten what it is like with you barbarians,\u201d she said, her voice heavy with fond indulgence. \u201cIt has been so many years since I had to explain such things to my poet king.\u201d\n\u201cSo you would not be offended if I were to . . .\u201d I made an inarticulate gesture with my bandaged hand.\n\u201cYou are young and energetic,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a healthy thing for you to do. Why would I be offended? Do I suddenly own your sex, that I should be worried about you giving it away?\u201d\nVashet stopped as if something had just occurred to her. She turned to look at me. \u201cAre you offended that I have been having sex with others all this while?\u201d She watched my face intently. \u201cI see you are startled by it.\u201d\n\u201cI am startled,\u201d I admitted. Then I did a mental inventory and was surprised to discover I wasn\u2019t sure how I felt. \u201cI feel I ought to be offended,\u201d I said at last. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I am.\u201d\nVashet nodded approvingly. \u201cThat is a good sign. It shows you are becoming civilized. The other feeling is what you were brought up to think. It is like an old shirt that no longer fits you. And now, when you look at it", "closely, you can see it was ugly to begin with.\u201d\nI hesitated for a moment.\u201cOut of curiosity,\u201d I said, \u201chow many others have\nyou been with since we have been together?\u201d\nVashet seemed surprised by the question. She pursed her mouth and\nlooked up at the sky for a long moment before shrugging. \u201cHow many people have I spoken with since then? How many have I sparred with? How many times have I eaten, or practiced my Ketan? Who counts such things?\u201d\n\u201cAnd most Adem think this way?\u201d I asked, glad to finally have the chance to ask these questions. \u201cThat sex is not an intimate thing?\u201d\n\u201cOf course it is intimate,\u201d Vashet said. \u201cAnything that brings two people close together is intimate. A conversation, a kiss, a whisper. Even fighting is intimate. But we are not strange about our sex. We do not feel shame about it. We do not feel it important to keep someone else\u2019s sex all to ourselves, like a miser hoarding gold.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cMore than any other, this strangeness in your thinking sets you barbarians apart.\u201d\n\u201cBut what of romance then?\u201d I asked, slightly indignant. \u201cWhat of love?\u201d\nVashet laughed again then, loud and long and vastly amused. Half of Haert must have heard it, and it echoed back to us from the distant hills.\n\u201cYou barbarians,\u201d she said, wiping moisture from her eyes. \u201cI had forgotten how backward you are. My poet king was the same way. It took him a long, miserable time before he realized the truth of things: There is a great deal of difference between a penis and a heart.\u201d", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE\nCaesura\nTHE NEXT DAY I woke somewhat blearily. I hadn\u2019t drunk that much, but my body was no longer used to such things, and so I felt each drink three times that morning. I straggled to the baths, dunked myself in the hottest pool I could stand, then scrubbed the vaguely gritty feeling away as best I could.\nI was heading back to the dining hall when Vashet and Shehyn found me in the hallway.Vashet gestured for me to follow, and I fell in step behind them. I hardly felt up for training or a formal conversation, but refusing didn\u2019t seem like a realistic option.\nWe wound our way through several hallways, eventually emerging near the center of the school. Passing through a courtyard we approached a small, square building that Shehyn unlocked with a small iron key: the first locked door I had seen in all of Haert.\nThe three of us moved into a small windowless entryway. Vashet closed the outside door and the room grew black as pitch, cutting off the sound of the persistent wind. Then Shehyn opened the inner door. Warm light from a half-dozen candles greeted us. At first it seemed odd they had been left to burn in an empty room....\nThen I saw what hung on the walls. Swords gleamed in the candlelight, dozens of them covering the walls. They were all of them naked, their scabbards hanging underneath them.\nThere were no ritual trappings of the sort you might find in a Tehlin church. No tapestries or paintings. Just the swords themselves. Still, it was obvious that this was an important place. There was a tension in the air of the sort you might feel in the Archives or an old graveyard.\nShehyn turned to Vashet. \u201cChoose.\u201d\nVashet looked startled by this, almost stricken. She started to make a gesture, but Shehyn held up a hand before she could protest.\n\u201cHe is your student,\u201d Shehyn said. Refusal.\u201cYou have brought him into the school. It is your choice.\u201d", "Vashet looked from Shehyn, to me, to the dozens of gleaming swords. They were all slender and deadly, each subtly different from the others. Some were curved, some longer or thicker than others. Some showed signs of much use, while some few resembled Vashet\u2019s, with worn hilts and unmarked blades of grey burnished metal.\nSlowly,Vashet moved to the right-hand wall. She picked up a sword, hefted it, and put it back. Then she lifted a different one, gripped it, and held it out to me.\nI took hold of it. It was light and thin as a whisper.\n\u201cMaiden Combs Her Hair,\u201d Vashet said.\nI obeyed, feeling somewhat self-conscious, as Shehyn was watching. But\nbefore I made it halfway through the sweeping movement, Vashet was already shaking her head. She took the sword back from me and returned it to the wall.\nAfter another minute she handed me a second sword. It had worn etching running down the blade, like a crawling ivy. At Vashet\u2019s request, I made Heron Falling. I swept high and lunged low, sword flickering. Vashet raised an eyebrow to me, questioning.\nI shook my head. \u201cThe point is too heavy for me.\u201d\nVashet didn\u2019t seem particularly surprised and returned that sword to the wall as well.\nSo things continued. Vashet hefted swords and rejected most without a word. She set three more in my hands, asked for various pieces of the Ketan, then returned them to the wall without asking my opinion.\nVashet moved more slowly as she made her way along the second wall. She handed me a sword slightly curved like Penthe\u2019s, and my breath caught when I saw the blade was the same flawless, burnished grey as Vashet\u2019s. I took it carefully, but the grip wasn\u2019t right for my fingers. When I handed it back, I saw relief written plainly on her face.\nAs she progressed along the wall, occasionally Vashet would steal a glance at Shehyn. At those moments, she looked very little like my confident, swaggering teacher and very much like a young woman desperately hoping for a word of advice. Shehyn remained impassive.\nEventually Vashet came to the third wall, moving slower and slower. She handled almost every sword now, taking a long time before setting them back in their places.\nThen, slowly, she laid her hand on another sword with a blade of burnished", "grey. She lifted it off the wall, gripped it, and seemed to age ten years.\nVashet avoided looking at Shehyn, and handed me the sword. The guard of this one extended out slightly, curving to give a hint of protection to the hand.\nIt was nothing like a full hand guard. Anything that bulky would render half the Ketan useless. But it looked as if it would give my fingers an extra bit of shelter, and that was appealing to me.\nThe warm grip settled into my palm as smoothly as the neck of my lute.\nBefore she could ask, I made Maiden Combs Her Hair. It felt like stretching after a long stiff sleep. I eased into Twelve Stones, and for the smallest of moments I felt graceful as Penthe looked when she fought. I made Heron Falling and it was sweet and simple as a kiss.\nVashet held out her hand to take it back from me. I didn\u2019t want to give it up, but I did. I knew this was the worst possible time and place for me to make a scene.\nHolding the sword, Vashet turned to Shehyn. \u201cThis is the one for him,\u201d she said. And for the first time since I\u2019d known my teacher, it was as if all the laughing had been pressed out of her. Her voice was thin and dry.\nShehyn nodded. \u201cI agree.You have done well to find it.\u201d\nVashet\u2019s relief was palpable, though her face still looked somewhat stricken. \u201cIt will perhaps offset his name,\u201d she said. She held the sword out to Shehyn.\nShehyn gestured: Refusal. \u201cNo. Your student. Your choice. Your responsibility.\u201d\nVashet took the scabbard from the wall and sheathed the sword. Then she turned and held it out to me. \u201cThis is named Saicere.\u201d\n\u201cCaesura?\u201d I asked, startled by the name. Wasn\u2019t that what Sim had called the break in the line of Eld Vintic verse? Was I being given a poet\u2019s sword?\n\u201cSaicere,\u201d she said softly, as if it were the name of God. She stepped back, and I felt the weight of it settle back into my hands.\nSensing something was expected of me, I drew it from its sheath. The faint ring of leather and metal seemed a whisper of its name: Saicere. It felt light in my hand. The blade was flawless. I slid it back into its sheath and the sound was different. It sounded like the breaking of a line. It said: Caesura.\nShehyn opened the inner door, and we left as we came. Silently and with respect.\n \nThe rest of the day was quite the opposite of exciting. With a dogged and humorless persistence, Vashet taught me how to care for my sword. How to clean and oil my sword. How to dismantle and reassemble my sword. How to strap the scabbard to my shoulder or hip. How the slightly enlarged guard would alter a few of the grips and motions of the Ketan.\nThe sword was not mine. The sword belonged to the school. To Ademre. I would return it when I was no longer able to fight.\nWhile I normally have little tolerance for hearing the same thing over and over again, I let Vashet ramble. The least I could do was let her repeat herself a bit when she was plainly anxious and trying to settle her mind.\nAround the fifteenth repetition, I asked what I should do if the sword broke. Not the hilt or the guard, but the blade itself. Should I still bring it back?\nVashet gave me a look of dismay so raw it verged on horror. She didn\u2019t answer, and I made a point of not asking any more questions for the rest of the morning.\nAfter lunch Vashet took me back to Magwyn\u2019s cave. My teacher\u2019s mood seemed somewhat improved, but she was still far from her regular gregarious self.\n\u201cMagwyn will be giving you Saicere\u2019s story,\u201d she said. \u201cYou must memorize it.\u201d\n\u201cIts story?\u201d I asked.\nVashet shrugged. \u201cIn Ademic it is Atas. It is the history of your sword. Everyone who has carried it. What they have done. It is something you must know.\u201d\nWe reached the top of the path and stood before Magwyn\u2019s door. Vashet gave me a serious look. \u201cYou must be on your best behavior and be very polite.\u201d\n\u201cI will,\u201d I said.\n\u201cMagwyn is an important person, and you must attend closely to what she says.\u201d\n \n\u201cI will,\u201d I said.\nVashet knocked on the door and escorted me in.\nMagwyn sat at the same table as before. For all I could tell, she was\ncopying the same book. She smiled when she saw Vashet, then noticed me and let her face slide into the familiar Adem impassivity.\n\u201cMagwyn,\u201d Vashet said. Profoundly polite entreaty. \u201cThis one needs the Atas of his sword.\u201d\n\u201cWhich sword did you find for him?\u201d Magwyn asked, her face wrinkling even further as she squinted to see.\n\u201cSaicere,\u201dVashet said.\nMagwyn gave a laugh that was almost a cackle. She got down off her chair. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised,\u201d she said, and disappeared through a door that led back into the cliff.\nVashet let herself out, and I stood there feeling awkward, like one of those terrible dreams when you\u2019re on stage and can\u2019t remember what to say, or even what part you were meaning to play.\nMagwyn returned, carrying a thick book bound in brown leather. At a gesture from her, we took seats in chairs facing each other. Hers was a deeply cushioned leather chair. Mine was not. I sat with Caesura across my knees. Partly because it seemed appropriate, and partly because I was fond of the feel of it beneath my hand.\nShe opened the book, the binding crackling as she spread it open on her lap. She flipped pages for a moment until she found the place she was looking for. \u201cFirst came Chael,\u201d she read. \u201cWho shaped me in fire for an unknown purpose. He carried me then cast me aside.\u201d\nMagwyn looked up, unable to gesture as her hands were both occupied by the large book. \u201cWell?\u201d she demanded.\n\u201cWhat would you like me to do?\u201d I asked politely. I couldn\u2019t gesture due to my bandages. We made a fine pair of half-mutes.\n\u201cRepeat it back,\u201d she said, irritated. \u201cYou need to learn them all.\u201d\n\u201cFirst came Chael,\u201d I said. \u201cWho shaped me in fire for an unknown purpose. He carried me then cast me aside.\u201d\nShe nodded and continued. \u201cNext came Etaine . . .\u201d\nI repeated it. We continued this way for perhaps a half hour. Owner after owner. Name after name. Loyalties declaimed and enemies killed.\nAt first the names and places were tantalizing. Then, as it continued, the list began to depress me, as nearly each piece ended with the death of the", "owner. They were not peaceful deaths either. Some died in wars, some in duels. Many were merely \u201ckilled by\u201d or \u201cslain by,\u201d giving no clue as to the circumstances. After thirty of these, I had heard nothing resembling, \u201cPassed from this world peacefully in his sleep, surrounded by fat grandchildren.\u201d\nThen the list stopped being depressing and became simply boring instead.\n\u201cNext came Finol of the clear and shining eye,\u201d I repeated attentively. \u201cMuch beloved of Dulcen. She herself slew two daruna, then was killed by gremmen at the Drossen Tor.\u201d\nI cleared my throat before Magwyn could recite another passage. \u201cIf I may ask,\u201d I said. \u201cHow many have carried Caesura over the years?\u201d\n\u201cSaicere,\u201d she corrected me sharply. \u201cDo not presume to meddle with her name. It means to break, to catch, and to fly.\u201d\nI looked down at the sheathed sword across my lap. I felt the weight of it, the chill of the metal under my fingers. A small sliver of the smooth grey blade was visible above the top of the sheath.\nHow can I say this so you can understand? Saicere was a fine name. It was thin and bright and dangerous. It fit the sword like a glove fits a hand.\nBut it wasn\u2019t the perfect name. This sword\u2019s name was Caesura. This sword was the jarring break in a line of perfect verse. It was the broken breath. It was smooth and swift and sharp and deadly. The name didn\u2019t fit like a glove. It fit like skin. More than that. It was bone and muscle and movement. Those things are the hand. And Caesura was the sword. It was the both the name and the thing itself.\nI can\u2019t tell you how I knew this. But I knew it.\nBesides, if I was to be a namer, I decided I could damn well choose the name of my own sword.\nI looked up at Magwyn. \u201cIt is a good name,\u201d I agreed politely, deciding to keep my opinion to myself until I was well gone from Ademre. \u201cI am only wondering how many owners there have been entirely. That is something I should know as well.\u201d\nMagwyn gave me a sour look that said she knew I was patronizing her. But she flipped ahead several pages in her book. Then a few more.\nThen a few more.\n\u201cTwo hundred and thirty-six,\u201d she said. \u201cYou will be the two hundred thirty-seventh.\u201d She flipped back to the beginning of the list. \u201cLet us begin again.\u201d She drew a breath and said. \u201cFirst came Chael, who shaped me in fire for an unknown purpose. He carried me then cast me aside.\u201d", "I fought down the urge to sigh. Even with my trouper\u2019s knack for learning lines it would take long, weary days setting them all to memory.\nThen I realized what this truly meant. If each owner had kept Caesura for ten years, and it had never sat idle for longer than a day or two, that meant Caesura was, at a very conservative estimate, more than two thousand years old.\nI received my next surprise three hours later when I tried to excuse myself for supper. As I stood to leave Magwyn explained I was to remain with her until I learned all of Caesura\u2019s story by heart. Someone would bring us our meals, and there was a room nearby where I could sleep.\nFirst came Chael . . .\n \nCHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-SIX\nThe First Stone\nI SPENT THE NEXT THREE days with Magwyn. It wasn\u2019t bad, especially considering my left hand was still healing, so my ability to talk and fight was rather limited.\nI like to think I did rather well. It would have been easier for me to memorize an entire play than this. A play fits together like a jigsaw. Dialogue moves back and forth. There is a shape to a story.\nBut what I learned from Magwyn was merely a long string of unfamiliar names and unconnected events. It was a laundry list masquerading as a story.\nStill, I learned it all by heart. It was late in the evening of the third day when I recited it back flawlessly to Magwyn. The hardest part was not singing it as I recited. Music carries words over miles and into hearts and memories. Committing Caesura\u2019s history to memory had been much easier when I\u2019d started fitting it to the tune of an old Vintish ballad in my head.\nThe next morning Magwyn demanded I recite it again. After I made it through a second time, she scribbled a note to Shehyn, sealed it in wax, and shooed me out of her cave.\n\u201cWe had not expected Magwyn to be finished with you for several days yet,\u201d Shehyn said, reading the note. \u201cVashet took a trip to Feant and will not be back for at least two days.\u201d\nThat meant I had memorized the Atas twice as quickly as their best estimate. I felt more than a little pride in that.\nShehyn glanced at my left hand and gave the barest frown. \u201cWhen did you have your dressings removed?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cI could not find you at first,\u201d I said. \u201cSo I went to visit Daeln. He said it has healed quite nicely.\u201d I flexed my newly unbandaged left hand and\n \ngestured joyful relief. \u201cThere is hardly any stiffness in the skin, and he reassures me even that will fade soon with proper care.\u201d\nI looked at Shehyn, expecting to see some gesture of approval or satisfaction. Instead I saw exasperated irritation.\n\u201cHave I done something wrong?\u201d I asked. Confused regret. Apology.\nShehyn motioned to my hand. \u201cIt could have been a convenient excuse to postpone your stone trial,\u201d she said. Irritated resignation. \u201cNow we must go ahead with it today, Vashet or no.\u201d\nI felt a familiar anxiety settle back onto me, like a dark bird clenching its claws deep into the muscles of my neck and shoulders. I\u2019d thought the tedium of memorization had been the last of it, but apparently the final shoe was yet to drop. I didn\u2019t like the sound of the term \u201cstone trial,\u201d either.\n\u201cReturn here after midday meal.\u201d Shehyn said. Dismissal.\u201cGo. I have much to prepare before then.\u201d\nI went looking for Penthe. With Vashet gone, she was the only one I knew well enough to ask about the upcoming trial.\nBut she wasn\u2019t in her house, the school, or the baths. Eventually I gave up, stretched, and rehearsed my Ketan, first with Caesura, then without. Then I made my way to the baths and scrubbed away three days of sitting and doing nothing.\nShehyn was waiting for me when I returned after lunch, holding her carved wooden sword. She looked at my empty hands and made an exasperated gesture. \u201cWhere is your dueling sword?\u201d\n\u201cIn my room,\u201d I said. \u201cI did not know I would need it.\u201d\n\u201cRun fetch it,\u201d she said. \u201cThen meet me at the stone hill.\u201d\n\u201cShehyn,\u201d I said. Urgent imploring. \u201cI don\u2019t know where that is. I don\u2019t\nknow anything about the stone trial.\u201d\nSurprise. \u201cVashet never told you?\u201d Disbelief.\nI shook my head. Sincere apology. \u201cWe were focused on other things.\u201d Exasperation. \u201cIt is simple enough,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst you will recite\nSaicere\u2019s Atas for all gathered. Then you will climb the hill. At the first stone, you will fight one from the school who is ranked of the first stone. If you win, you will continue to climb and fight someone of the second stone.\u201d\nShehyn looked at me. \u201cIn your case, this is a formality. Occasionally a student enters the school with exceptional talent. Vashet was one such as this, and she gained the second stone at her first trial.\u201d Blunt honesty. \u201cYou are not such a one. Your Ketan is still poor, and you cannot expect to gain even the", "first stone. The stone hill is east of the baths.\u201d She flicked her hand at me: Hurry.\nThere was a crowd gathered at the foot of the stone hill by the time I arrived, more than a hundred people. Grey homespun and muted colors vastly outnumbered mercenary red, and the low murmur of the crowd\u2019s conversation was audible from a distance.\nThe hill itself wasn\u2019t particularly high, nor was it steep. But the path to the top cut back and forth in a series of switchbacks. At each corner there was a wide, flat space with a large block of grey stone. There were four corners, four stones, and four red-shirted mercenaries. At the top of the hill stood a tall greystone, familiar as a friend. Beside that stood a small figure in blinding white.\nAs I came closer, I caught a smell drifting on the breeze: toasted chestnuts. Only then did I relax. This was pageantry of a sort. While \u201cstone trial\u201d had an intimidating sound to it, I doubted very much that I was going to be brutalized in front of a milling audience while someone sold roasted nuts.\nI entered the crowd and approached the hill. I could see it was Shehyn next to the greystone. I also recognized the heart-shaped face and long, hanging braid of Penthe at the third stone.\nThe crowd parted gently as I walked to the foot of the hill. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a blood-red figure rushing toward me. Alarmed, I turned and saw it was none other than Tempi. He hurried toward me, gesturing a broad enthusiastic greeting.\nI fought the urge to smile and shout his name, settling instead on a gesture of joyful excitement.\nHe came to stand directly in front of me, gripping me by my shoulder and jostling me around playfully, as if congratulating me. But his eyes were intense. Close to his chest his hand said, deception where only I could see. \u201cListen,\u201d he spoke quickly under his breath. \u201cYou cannot win this fight.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Reassurance. \u201cShehyn thinks the same, but I might surprise you.\u201d\nTempi\u2019s grip on my shoulder grew painfully tight. \u201cListen,\u201d he hissed. \u201cLook who is at the first stone.\u201d\n \nI looked over his shoulder. It was Carceret. Her eyes were like knives.\n\u201cShe is full of rage,\u201d Tempi said quietly, gesturing fond affection for the crowd to see. \u201cAs if your admittance to the school was not enough, you have been given her mother\u2019s sword.\u201d\nThat piece of news knocked the wind out of me. My mind flickered to the final piece of the Atas. \u201cLarel was Carceret\u2019s mother?\u201d I asked.\nTempi ran his right hand affectionately through my hair. \u201cYes. She is enraged past reason. I fear she would gladly cripple you, even if it means being thrown from the school.\u201d\nI nodded seriously.\n\u201cShe will try to disarm you. Be wary of it. Do not grapple. If she catches you with Sleeping Bear or Circling Hands, submit quickly. Shout it if you must. If you hesitate or try to break away, she will shatter your arm or pull it from your shoulder. I heard her say this to her sister not an hour ago.\u201d\nSuddenly, Tempi stepped away from me and gestured deferential respect.\nI felt a tapping at my arm and turned to see Magwyn\u2019s wrinkled face. \u201cCome,\u201d she said with quiet authority. \u201cIt is time.\u201d\nI fell into step behind her. As we walked, everyone in the crowd gestured some manner of respect toward her. Magwyn led me to the beginning of the path. There was a block of grey stone, slightly taller than my knee and identical to the others at each corner of the path.\nThe old woman gestured for me to climb up onto the stone. I looked out over the group of Adem and had an unprecedented moment of stage fright.\nBending a bit, I spoke softly to Magwyn. \u201cIs it appropriate for me to raise my voice when reciting this?\u201d I asked her nervously. \u201cI do not mean to be offensive, but if I do not, those in the back will not be able to hear.\u201d\nMagwyn smiled at me for the first time, her wrinkled face suddenly sweet. She patted my hand. \u201cNo one will be offended at a loud voice here,\u201d she said, gesturing considerate moderation. \u201cGive.\u201d\nI unbuckled Saicere and handed it over. Then Magwyn urged me onto the stone.\nI recited the Atas while Magwyn watched. Though I was confident of my memory, it was still nerve-wracking. I wondered what would happen if I skipped an owner or misplaced a name.\nIt took the better part of an hour before I was done, the audience of Adem listening with an almost eerie quiet. When I finished, Magwyn offered her hand, helping me down from the stone as if I were a lady descending from a", "carriage. Then she gestured up the hill.\nI wiped the sweat from my hand and gripped the wooden hilt of my\ndueling sword as I started up the path. Carceret\u2019s reds were strapped tightly across her long arms and broad shoulders. The leather straps she used were wider and thicker than Tempi\u2019s. They looked to be a brighter red, too, and I wonder if she had dyed them especially for today. As I came closer, I saw she had the fading remains of a black eye.\nOnce she saw I was watching, Carceret tossed her wooden sword away in a slow, deliberate motion. She gestured disdain broadly enough so they could see it in the ha\u2019penny seats at the back of the crowd.\nThere was a murmur from the crowd and I stopped walking, uncertain what to do. After a moment\u2019s thought, I lay my own training sword down by the side of the path and continued to walk.\nCarceret waited in the center of a flat, grassy circle about thirty feet across. The ground was soft here, so I wouldn\u2019t ordinarily worry about being thrown. Ordinarily. Vashet had taught me the difference between throwing someone to the ground and throwing someone at the ground. The first was what you did during a polite bout. The second was what you would use in a true fight where the intention was to maim or kill your opponent.\nBefore I came too close, I fell into the now-familiar fighter\u2019s crouch. I raised my hands, bent my knees, and fought the urge to rise up onto the balls of my feet, knowing I would feel quicker, and ruin my balance as a result. I took a deep, steadying breath and slowly moved toward her.\nCarceret fell into a similar crouch, and just as I was coming to the outside limits of her reach, she made a feint toward me. It was only a slight twitch of the hand and shoulder, but, anxious as I was, I fell for it wholeheartedly and skittered away like a startled rabbit.\nCarceret lowered her hands and stood up straight, abandoning her fighting crouch. Amusement, she gestured broadly, invitation. Then she beckoned with both hands. I heard a few pieces of laughter drift up from the crowd below.\nHumiliating as her attitude was, I was eager to take advantage of her lowered guard. I moved forward and made a cautious attempt at Hands like Knives. Too cautious, and she stepped away from it without even needing to lift her hands.\nI knew I was outclassed as a fighter. That meant my only hope was to play on her already hot emotions. If I could infuriate her, she might make mistakes. If she made mistakes, I might be able to win. \u201cFirst came Chael,\u201d I", "said, giving her my widest, most barbaric smile.\nCarceret took a half step closer. \u201cI am going to crush your pretty hands,\u201d\nshe hissed in perfect Aturan. As she spoke she reached out and made a vicious gripping motion at me.\nShe was trying to scare me, make me recoil and lose my balance. And honestly, the raw venom in her voice made me want to do just that.\nBut I was ready. I resisted my reflex to pull back. In doing so I froze for a moment, neither retreating nor advancing.\nOf course, this is what Carceret was truly waiting for, a half-moment\u2019s hesitation as I fought the urge to flee. She closed on me in a single easy step and caught my wrist, her hand tight as a band of iron.\nWithout thinking, I used Celean\u2019s curious two-handed version of Break Lion. Perfect for a small girl struggling against a grown man, or a hopelessly outclassed musician trying to escape an Adem mercenary.\nI regained control of my hand, and the unorthodox movement startled Carceret ever so slightly. I took advantage of it and struck out quickly with Sowing Barley, snapping my knuckles hard against the meat of her inner bicep.\nIt wasn\u2019t a hard punch, I was too close for that. But if I managed to hit the nerve properly, the blow would numb her hand. This wouldn\u2019t just make her weak on her left side, but it would make all the two-handed motions of the Ketan more difficult. A significant advantage.\nSince I was still so close, I immediately followed Sowing Barley with Turn Millstone, giving her a short, firm push to knock her off balance. I managed to get both hands on her, and even pushed her backward by perhaps four inches, but Carceret came nowhere near to losing her balance.\nThen I saw her eyes. I\u2019d thought she\u2019d been angry before, but it was nothing compared to now. Now I\u2019d managed to actually strike her. Not just once, but twice. A barbarian with less than two months of training had struck her twice, while everyone in the school looked on.\nI cannot describe how she looked. And even if I could, it would not impress upon you the truth of things, as her face was still almost entirely impassive. Instead let me say this. I have never seen anyone so furious in my entire life. Not Ambrose. Not Hemme. Not Denna when I criticized her song or the Maer when I defied him. Those angers were pale candles compared to the forge fire burning in Carceret\u2019s eyes.\nBut even in the full flower of her fury, Carceret was perfectly in control.", "She didn\u2019t lash out wildly or snarl at me. She kept her words inside her, burning them like fuel.\nI couldn\u2019t win this fight. But my hands moved automatically, trained by hundreds of hours of practice to take advantage of her nearness. I stepped forward and tried to grab hold of her for Thunder Upward. Her hands snapped out, brushing the attack away. Then she lashed out with Bargeman at the Dock.\nI don\u2019t think she expected it to connect. A more competent opponent would have avoided or blocked it. But I had let myself get slightly wrongfooted, so I was off balance, so I was slow, so her foot caught me in the stomach and pushed.\nBargeman at the Dock isn\u2019t a quick kick meant to break bones. It is a kick that shoves the opponent off balance. As I was already off balance, it pushed me right off my feet. I landed jarringly on my back, then rolled to a stop in a messy tangle of limbs.\nNow some might say that I had taken a bad fall and was obviously too stupefied to find my feet and continue the fight. Others might say that while it was messy, the fall wasn\u2019t quite as hard as all that, and I had certainly found my feet after worse.\nPersonally, I think the line between being stupefied and being wise is sometimes very thin. How thin, I suppose, I will leave to you to decide.", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-SEVEN\nAnger\n\u201cWHAT WERE YOU THINKING?\u201d Tempi demanded. Disappointment. Fierce chastisement. \u201cWhat fool sets his sword aside?\u201d\n\u201cShe threw her sword away first!\u201d I protested.\n\u201cOnly to lure you in,\u201d Tempi said. \u201cOnly as a trap.\u201d\nI was buckling Caesura\u2019s scabbard so the hilt hung over my shoulder.\nThere hadn\u2019t been any particular ceremony after I had lost. Magwyn simply returned my sword and smiled at me, patting my hand in a comforting way.\nI watched the crowd slowly dispersing below, and gestured polite disbelief to Tempi. \u201cShould I have kept my sword when she was unarmed?\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d Absolute agreement. \u201cShe is five times the fighter you are. You might have had a chance if you had kept your sword!\u201d\n\u201cTempi is right,\u201d I heard Shehyn\u2019s voice behind me. \u201cKnowing your enemy is in keeping with the Lethani. Once a fight is inevitable, a clever fighter takes any advantage.\u201d I turned and saw her coming down the path. Penthe walked beside her.\nI gestured polite certainty. \u201cIf I had kept my sword and won, people would have thought Carceret was a fool and resented me for gaining a rank I did not deserve. And if I had kept my sword and lost, it would have been humiliating. Neither reflects well on me.\u201d I looked back and forth between Shehyn and Tempi. \u201cAm I wrong in this?\u201d\n\u201cYou are not wrong in this.\u201d Shehyn said. \u201cBut neither is Tempi wrong.\u201d \u201cVictory is always to be sought,\u201d Tempi said. Firm.\nShehyn turned to face him. \u201cSuccess is key,\u201d she said. \u201cVictory is not\nalways needed to succeed.\u201d\nTempi gestured respectful disagreement and opened his mouth to respond,\nbut Penthe spoke first, cutting him off. \u201cKvothe, are you hurt from your fall?\u201d \u201cNot badly,\u201d I said, moving my back gingerly. \u201cA few bruises, perhaps.\u201d \u201cDo you have anything to put on them?\u201d\nI shook my head.", "Penthe stepped forward and took hold of my arm. \u201cI have things at my house. We will leave these two to discuss the Lethani. Someone should tend to your hurts.\u201d She held my arm with her left hand, making her statement curiously empty of any emotional content.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Shehyn said after a moment, and Tempi gestured a hasty agreement . But Penthe was already leading me firmly down the hill.\nWe walked for a quarter mile or so, Penthe holding my arm lightly.\nEventually she spoke in her lightly accented Aturan. \u201cAre you bruised badly enough to need a salve?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cNot really,\u201d I admitted.\n\u201cI thought not,\u201d she said. \u201cBut after I have lost a fight, I rarely wish to have people tell me how I lost it.\u201d She flashed me a small, secret smile.\nI smiled back.\nWe continued to walk, and Penthe kept hold of my arm, subtly guiding us through a grove of trees, then up a steep path carved through a small bluff. Eventually we came to a secluded dell that had a carpet of wild papavlerflower blossoming among the grass. Their loose, blood-red petals were almost exactly the same color as Penthe\u2019s mercenary reds.\n\u201cVashet told me barbarians have strange rituals with your sex,\u201d Penthe said. \u201cShe told me if I wanted to bed you, I should bring you to some flowers.\u201d She gestured around. \u201cThese are the best I could find in this season.\u201d She looked up at me expectantly.\n\u201cAh,\u201d I said. \u201cI expect Vashet was having a bit of a joke with you. Or perhaps a joke with me.\u201d Penthe frowned and I hurried to continue. \u201cBut it is true that among the barbarians there are many rituals that lead up to sex. It is somewhat more complicated there.\u201d\nPenthe gestured sullen irritation. \u201cI should not be surprised,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone tells stories about the barbarians. Some of it is training, so I can move well among you.\u201d Wry however. \u201cSince I have not been out among them yet, they also tell stories to tease me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat sort of stories?\u201d I asked, thinking of what I had heard about the Adem and the Lethani before I had met Tempi.\nShe shrugged, slight embarrassment. \u201cIt is foolishness. They say all the barbarian men are huge.\u201d She gestured far above her head, showing a height of more than seven feet. \u201cNaden told me he went to a town where the barbarians ate a soup made of dirt. They say the barbarians never bathe. They say barbarians drink their own urine, believing it will help them live longer.\u201d", "She shook her head, laughing and gesturing horrified amusement.\n\u201cAre you saying,\u201d I asked slowly, \u201cthat you don\u2019t drink yours?\u201d Penthe froze midlaugh and looked at me, her face and hands showing a\nconfused, apologetic mix of embarrassment, disgust, and disbelief. It was such a bizarre tangle of emotions I couldn\u2019t help but laugh, and I saw her relax when she realized the joke.\n\u201cI understand,\u201d I said. \u201cWe tell similar stories about the Adem.\u201d\nHer eyes lit up. \u201cYou must tell me as I told you. It is fair.\u201d\nGiven Tempi\u2019s reaction when I\u2019d told him of the word-fire and Lethani, I\ndecided to share something else. \u201cThey say those who take the red never have sex. They say you take that energy and put it into your Ketan, and that is why you are such good fighters.\u201d\nPenthe laughed hard at that. \u201cI would have never made the third stone if that were the case,\u201d she said. Wry amusement. \u201cIf keeping from sex gave me my fighting, there would be days I could not make even a fist.\u201d\nI felt my pulse quicken a bit at that.\n\u201cStill,\u201d she said. \u201cI can see where that story comes from. They must think we have no sex because no Adem would bed a barbarian.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d I said, somewhat disappointed. \u201cWhy have you brought me to the flowers then?\u201d\n\u201cYou are now of Ademre,\u201d she said easily. \u201cI expect many will approach you now. You have a sweet face, and it is hard not to be curious about your anger.\u201d\nPenthe paused and glanced significantly downward. \u201cThat is unless you are diseased?\u201d\nI blushed at this. \u201cWhat? No! Of course not!\u201d\n\u201cAre you certain?\u201d\n\u201cI have studied at the Medica,\u201d I said somewhat stiffly. \u201cThe greatest\nschool of medicine in all the world. I know all about the diseases a person might catch, how to spot them and how to treat them.\u201d\nPenthe gave me a skeptical look. \u201cI do not question you in particular. But it is well known that barbarians are quite frequently diseased in their sex.\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cThis is just another foolish story. I assure you the barbarians are no more diseased than the Adem. In fact, I expect we may be less.\u201d\nShe shook her head, her eyes serious. \u201cNo. You are wrong in this. Of a hundred barbarians, how many would you say were so afflicted?\u201d", "It was an easy statistic I knew from the Medica. \u201cOut of every hundred? Perhaps five. More among those who work in brothels or frequent such places, of course.\u201d\nPenthe\u2019s face showed obvious disgust and she shivered. \u201cOf one hundred Adem, none are so afflicted,\u201d she said firmly. Absolute.\n\u201cOh come now.\u201d I held up my hand, making a circle with my fingers. \u201cNone?\u201d\n\u201cNone,\u201d she said with grim certainty. \u201cThe only place we could catch such a thing is from a barbarian, and those who travel are warned.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if you caught a disease from another Adem who had not been careful while traveling?\u201d I asked.\nPenthe\u2019s tiny heart-shaped face went grim, her nostrils flaring. \u201cFrom one of my own?\u201d Vast anger. \u201cIf one of Ademre were to give me a disease, I would be furious. I would shout from the top of a cliff what they had done. I would make their life as painful as a broken bone.\u201d\nShe gestured disgust, brushing at the front of her shirt in the first piece of Adem hand-talk I had ever learned from Tempi. \u201cThen I would make the long trek over the mountains into the Tahl to be cured of it. Even if the trip should take two years and bring no money to the school. And none would think the less of me for that.\u201d\nI nodded to myself. It made sense. Given their attitudes about sex, if it were any other way, disease would run rampant through the population.\nI saw Penthe looking at me expectantly. \u201cThank you for the flowers,\u201d I said.\nShe nodded and stepped closer, looking up at me. Her eyes were excited as she smiled her shy smile. Then her face grew serious. \u201cIs it enough to satisfy your barbarian rituals, or is there more that must be done?\u201d\nI reached down and ran my hand along the smooth skin of her neck, sliding my fingertips under the long braid so they brushed the back of her neck. She closed her eyes and tipped her face up toward mine.\n\u201cThey are lovely, and more than enough,\u201d I said, and bent to kiss her.\n\u201cI was right,\u201d Penthe said with a contented sigh as we lay naked among the flowers. \u201cYou have a fine anger.\u201d I lay on my back, her small body curled\n \nunder my arm, her heart-shaped face resting gently on my chest.\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d I asked. \u201cI think anger might be the wrong\nword.\u201d\n\u201cI mean Vaevin,\u201d she said, using the Ademic term. \u201cIs that the same?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know that word,\u201d I admitted.\n\u201cI think anger is the right word,\u201d she said. \u201cI have spoken with Vashet in\nyour language, and she did not correct me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean by anger, then?\u201d I asked. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t feel\nangry.\u201d\nPenthe lifted her head from my chest and gave me a lazy, satisfied smile.\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said. \u201cI have taken your anger. How could you feel such a way?\u201d\n\u201cAre . . . are you angry then?\u201d I asked, sure I was missing the point entirely.\nPenthe laughed and shook her head. She had undone her long braid and her honey-colored hair hung down the side of her face. It made her look like an entirely different person. That and the lack of the mercenary reds, I supposed. \u201cIt is not that kind of anger. I am glad to have it.\u201d\n\u201cI still do not understand,\u201d I said. \u201cThis could be something barbarians do not know. Explain it to me as if I were a child.\u201d\nShe looked at me for a moment, her eyes serious, then she rolled over onto her stomach so she could face me more easily. \u201cThis anger is not a feeling. It is . . .\u201d She hesitated, frowning prettily. \u201cIt is a desire. It is a making. It is a wanting of life.\u201d\nPenthe looked around, then focused on the grass around us. \u201cAnger is what makes the grass press up through the ground to reach the sun,\u201d she said. \u201cAll things that live have anger. It is the fire in them that makes them want to move and grow and do and make.\u201d She cocked her head. \u201cDoes that make sense to you?\u201d\n\u201cI think so,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd women take the anger from men in sex?\u201d\nShe smiled, nodding. \u201cThat is why afterward a man is so weary. He gives a piece of himself. He collapses. He sleeps.\u201d She glanced down. \u201cOr a part of him sleeps.\u201d\n\u201cNot for long,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThat is because you have a fine, strong anger,\u201d she said proudly. \u201cAs I have already said. I can tell because I have taken a piece of it. I can tell there is more waiting.\u201d", "\u201cThere is,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut what do women do with the anger?\u201d\n\u201cWe use it,\u201d Penthe said simply. \u201cThat is why, afterward, a woman does not always sleep as a man does. She feels more awake. Full of the need to move. Often full of desire for more of what brought her the anger in the first place.\u201d She lowered her head to my chest and bit me playfully, wriggling her naked body against me.\nIt was pleasantly distracting. \u201cDoes this mean women have no anger of their own?\u201d\nShe laughed again. \u201cNo. All things have anger. But women have many uses for their anger. And men have more anger than they can use, too much for their own good.\u201d\n\u201cHow can one have too much of the desire to live and grow and make?\u201d I asked. \u201cIt seems more would be better.\u201d\nPenthe shook her head, brushing her hair back with one hand. \u201cNo. It is like food. One meal is good. Two meals is not better.\u201d She frowned again. \u201cNo. It is more like wine. One cup of wine is good, two is sometimes better, but ten . . . \u201dShe nodded seriously. \u201cThat is very much like anger. A man who grows full of it, it is like a poison in him. He wants too many things. He wants all things. He becomes strange and wrong in his head, violent.\u201d\nShe nodded to herself. \u201cYes. That is why anger is the right word, I think. You can tell a man who has been keeping all his anger to himself. It goes sour in him. It turns against itself and drives him to breaking rather than making.\u201d\n\u201cI can think of men like that,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I can think of women too.\u201d\n\u201cAll things have anger,\u201d she repeated with a shrug. \u201cA stone does not have much compared to a budding tree. It is the same with people. Some have more, or less. Some use it wisely. Some do not.\u201d She gave me a wide smile. \u201cI have a great deal, which is why I am so fond of sex and fierce in my fighting.\u201d She bit at my chest again, less playfully this time, and began to work her way up to my neck.\n\u201cBut if you take the anger from a man in sex,\u201d I said, struggling to concentrate, \u201cdoesn\u2019t that mean the more sex you have, the more you want?\u201d\n\u201cIt is like the water one uses to prime a pump,\u201d she said hotly against my ear. \u201cCome now, I will have all of it, even if it takes us all day and half the night.\u201d\n \nWe eventually moved from the grassy field to the baths, and then to Penthe\u2019s house of two snug rooms built against the side of a bluff. The moon was in the sky and had been watching us for some time through the window, though I doubt we showed her anything she hadn\u2019t seen before.\n\u201cIs that enough for you?\u201d I said breathlessly. We were side by side in her pleasantly capacious bed, the sweat drying off our bodies. \u201cIf you take much more of it, I might not have enough anger left to speak or breathe.\u201d\nMy hand lay on the flat plane of her belly. Her skin was soft and smooth, but when she laughed I could feel the muscles of her stomach jump, going hard as sheets of steel.\n\u201cIt is enough for now,\u201d she said, exhaustion plain in her voice. \u201cIt would upset Vashet if I left you empty as a fruit with all the juice pressed out.\u201d\nDespite my long day, I was oddly wakeful, my thoughts bright and clear. I remembered something she had said earlier. \u201cYou mentioned that a woman has many uses for her anger. What use does a woman have for it that a man does not?\u201d\n\u201cWe teach,\u201d she said. \u201cWe give names. We track the days and tend to the smooth turning of things. We plant. We make babies.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cMany things.\u201d\n\u201cA man can do those things as well,\u201d I said.\nPenthe chuckled. \u201cYou have the wrong word,\u201d she said, rubbing at my chin. \u201cA beard is what a man makes. A baby is something different, and that you have no part of.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t carry the baby,\u201d I said, slightly offended. \u201cBut still, we play our part in making it.\u201d\nPenthe turned to look at me, smiling as if I had made a joke. Then her smile faded. She propped herself up on her elbow and looked at me for another long moment. \u201cAre you in serious?\u201d\nSeeing my perplexed expression, her eyes grew wide with amazement and she sat upright on the bed. \u201cIt is true!\u201d she said. \u201cYou believe in man-mothers !\u201d She giggled, covering the bottom half of her face with both hands. \u201cI never believed it was true!\u201d She lowered her left hand, revealing an excited grin as she gestured amazed delight.\nI felt I should be irritated, but I couldn\u2019t quite muster the energy. Perhaps some of what she said about men giving away their anger had some truth to", "it. \u201cWhat is a man-mother?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cAre you not making a joke?\u201d she asked, one hand still half-covering her\nsmile. \u201cDo you truly believe a man puts a baby in a woman?\u201d\n\u201cWell . . . yes,\u201d I said a little awkwardly. \u201cIn a manner of speaking. It takes\na man and a woman to make a baby. A mother and a father.\u201d\n\u201cYou have a word for it!\u201d she said, delighted. \u201cThey told me this too. With\nthe stories of dirt soup. But I never thought it a real story!\u201d\nI sat up myself at this point, growing concerned. \u201cYou do know how\nbabies are made, don\u2019t you?\u201d I asked, gesturing serious earnestness. \u201cWhat we have been doing for most of the day is what makes a baby.\u201d\nShe looked at me for a moment in stunned silence, then dissolved helplessly into laughter, trying to speak several times only to have it overwhelm her again when she looked up at the expression on my face.\nPenthe put her hands on her belly, prodding it as if puzzled. \u201cWhere is my baby?\u201d She looked down at her flat belly. \u201cPerhaps I have been sexing wrong these years.\u201d When she laughed, the muscles across her stomach flickered, making a pattern like a turtle\u2019s shell. \u201cI should have a hundred babies if what you say is true. Five hundred babies!\u201d\n\u201cIt does not happen every time there is sex,\u201d I said. \u201cThere are only certain times when a woman is ripe for a baby.\u201d\n\u201cAnd have you done this?\u201d she asked, looking at me with mock seriousness while a smile tugged at her mouth. \u201cHave you made a baby with a woman?\u201d\n\u201cI have been careful not to do such a thing,\u201d I said. \u201cThere is an herb called silphium. I chew it every day, and it keeps me from putting a baby in a woman.\u201d\nPenthe shook her head. \u201cThis is more of your barbarian sex rituals,\u201d she said. \u201cDoes bringing a man to the flowers also make a baby where you come from?\u201d\nI decided to take a different tack. \u201cIf men do not help with making babies, how do you explain that babies look like their fathers?\u201d\n\u201cBabies look like angry old men,\u201d Penthe said. \u201cAll bald and with . . . \u201d She hesitated, touching her cheek. \u201c. . . with face lines. Perhaps the old men are the only ones making babies then?\u201d She smirked.\n\u201cWhat about kittens?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou have seen a litter of kittens. When a white cat and a black cat have sex, you get kittens both white and black. And kittens of both colors.\u201d", "\u201cAlways?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cNot always.\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut most times.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if there is a yellow kitten?\u201d she asked.\nBefore I could put together an answer, she waved the question away.\n\u201cKittens have little to do with this,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not like animals. We do not go into season. We do not lay eggs. We do not make cocoons, or fruit, or seeds. We are not dogs or frogs or trees.\u201d\nPenthe gave me a serious look. \u201cYou are committing a false thinking. You could as easily say two stones make baby stones by banging against each other until a piece breaks off. Therefore two people make baby peoples in the same way.\u201d\nI fumed, but she was right. I was committing a fallacy of analogy. It was faulty logic.\nOur conversation continued along this vein for some time. I asked her if she had ever known a woman to get pregnant who had not had sex in the previous months. She said she didn\u2019t know of any woman who would willingly go three months without sex, except those who were traveling among the barbarians, or very ill, or very old.\nEventually Penthe waved a hand to stop me, gesturing exasperation. \u201cDo you hear your own excuses? Sex makes babies, but not always. Babies look like man-mothers, but not always. The sex must be at the right time, but not always. There are plants that make it more likely, or less likely.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cYou must realize what you say is thin as a net. You keep sewing new threads, hoping it will hold water. But hoping does not make it true.\u201d\nSeeing me frown, she took my hand and gestured comfort into it as she had before in the dining hall, all the laughter gone out of her face. \u201cI can see you think this truly. I can understand why barbarian men would want to believe it. It must be comforting to think you are important in this way. But it is simply not.\u201d\nPenthe looked at me with something close to pity. \u201cSometimes a woman ripens. It is a natural thing, and men have no part in it. That is why more women ripen in the fall, like fruit. That is why more women ripen here in Haert, where it is better to have a child.\u201d\nI tried to think of some other convincing argument, but none would come to mind. It was frustrating.\nSeeing my expression, Penthe squeezed my hand and gestured concession. \u201cPerhaps it is different for barbarian women,\u201d she said.", "\u201cYou are only saying that to make me feel better,\u201d I said sullenly and was overcome with a jaw-popping yawn.\n\u201cI am,\u201d she admitted. Then she gave me a gentle kiss and pushed at my shoulders, encouraging me to lie back down on the bed.\nI did, and she nestled into the crook of my arm again, resting her head on my shoulder. \u201cIt must be hard to be a man,\u201d she said softly. \u201cA woman knows she is part of the world. We are full of life. A woman is the flower and the fruit. We move through time as part of our children. But a man . . .\u201d She turned her head and looked up at me with gentle pity in her eyes. \u201cYou are an empty branch. You know when you die, you will leave nothing of any import behind.\u201d\nPenthe stroked my chest fondly. \u201cI think that is why you are so full of anger. Maybe you do not have more than women. Maybe the anger in you simply has no place to go. Maybe it is desperate to leave some mark. It hammers at the world. It drives you to rash action. To bickering. To rage. You paint and build and fight and tell stories that are bigger than the truth.\u201d\nShe gave a contented sigh and rested her head on my shoulder, snugging herself firmly into the circle of my arm. \u201cI am sorry to tell you this thing. You are a good man, and a pretty thing. But still, you are only a man. All you have to offer the world is your anger.\u201d", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-EIGHT\nNames\nIT WAS THE DAY that I would either stay or leave. I sat with Vashet on a green hill, watching the sun rise out of the clouds to the east.\n\u201cSaicere means to fly, to catch, to break,\u201d Vashet said softly, repeating herself for the hundredth time. \u201cYou must remember all the hands that have held her. Many hands, all following the Lethani. You must never use her in an improper way.\u201d\n\u201cI promise,\u201d I said for the hundredth time, then hesitated before bringing up something that had been bothering me. \u201cBut Vashet, you used your sword to trim the willow branch you beat me with. I saw you use it to hold your window open once.You pare your nails with it . . .\u201d\nVashet gave me a blank look. \u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that improper?\u201d I asked.\nShe cocked her head, then laughed. \u201cYou mean I should only use it for\nfighting?\u201d\nI gestured obvious implication.\n\u201cA sword is sharp,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a tool. I carry it constantly, how is using\nit improper?\u201d\n\u201cIt seems disrespectful, \u201d I clarified.\n\u201cYou respect a thing by putting it to good use,\u201d she said. \u201cIt may be years\nbefore I return to the barbarian lands and fight. How does it harm my sword if it cuts kindling and carrots in the meantime?\u201d Vashet\u2019s eyes grew serious. \u201cTo carry a sword your whole life, knowing it was only for killing . . .\u201d She shook her head. \u201cWhat would that do to a person\u2019s mind? It would be a horrible thing.\u201d\nVashet had returned to Haert last night, dismayed that she had missed my stone trial. She said I was right to lay aside my sword when Carceret did, and that I had made her proud.\nYesterday, Shehyn had formally invited me to stay and train at the school. In theory, I already had earned that right, but everyone knew that was more", "of a political fiction than anything. Her offer was a flattering one, an opportunity I knew I would likely never have again.\nWe watched a boy herd a flock of goats down the side of a hill. \u201cVashet, is it true that the Adem have no concept of fatherhood?\u201d\nVashet nodded easily, then paused. \u201cTell me you did not embarrass both of us by talking about this with everyone while I was gone,\u201d she said with a sigh.\n\u201cOnly with Penthe,\u201d I said. \u201cShe thought it was the funniest thing she had heard in ten months\u2019 time.\u201d\n\u201cIt is fairly amusing at that,\u201d Vashet said, her mouth curving a little.\n\u201cIt\u2019s true then?\u201d I asked. \u201cEven you believe this? You\u2019ve . . .\u201d\nVashet held up a hand and I trailed off. \u201cPeace,\u201d she said. \u201cThink whatever\nyou wish about your man-mothers. It is all the same to me.\u201d She gave a soft smile of remembrance. \u201cMy poet king actually believed a woman was nothing more than the ground in which a man might plant a baby.\u201d\nVashet made an amused huffing sound that wasn\u2019t quite a laugh. \u201cHe was so sure he was right. Nothing could sway him. Years ago I decided arguing such things with a barbarian is a long, weary waste of my time.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cThink what you want about making babies. Believe in demons. Pray to a goat. So long as it doesn\u2019t bruise me, why should I bother myself?\u201d\nI chewed it over for a moment. \u201cThere\u2019s wisdom in that,\u201d I said.\nShe nodded.\n\u201cBut either a man helps with a baby or he does not,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cThere\ncan be many opinions on a thing, but there is only one truth.\u201d\nVashet smiled lazily. \u201cAnd if the pursuit of truth was my goal, that would\nconcern me.\u201d She gave a long yawn, stretching like a happy cat. \u201cInstead I will focus on the joy in my heart, the prosperity of the school, and understanding the Lethani. If I have time left after that, I will put it toward worrying on the truth.\u201d\nWe watched the sunrise for a while longer in silence. It occurred to me Vashet was quite a different person when she wasn\u2019t struggling to cram the Ketan and all of Ademic into my head as quickly as possible.\n\u201cThat said,\u201d Vashet added, \u201cif you persist in clinging to your barbarian beliefs about man-mothers, you would do well to keep quiet about it. Amusement is the best you can hope for. Most will simply assume you an idiot for thinking such things.\u201d\nI nodded. After a long moment, I decided to finally ask the question I had", "been holding off for days. \u201cMagwyn called me Maedre. What does it mean?\u201d \u201cIt is your name,\u201d she said. \u201cSpeak of it to no one.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a secret thing?\u201d I asked.\nShe nodded. \u201cIt is a thing for you and your teachers and Magwyn. It would\nbe dangerous to let others know what it is.\u201d\n\u201cHow could it be dangerous?\u201d\nVashet looked at me as if I were daft. \u201cWhen you know a name you have\npower over it. Surely you know this?\u201d\n\u201cBut I know your name, and Shehyn\u2019s and Tempi\u2019s. What danger is in\nthat?\u201d\nShe waved a hand. \u201cNot those names. Deep names. Tempi is not the name\nhe was given by Magwyn. Just as Kvothe is not yours. Deep names have meanings.\u201d\nI already knew what Vashet\u2019s name meant. \u201cWhat does Tempi mean?\u201d\n\u201cTempi means \u2018little iron.\u2019 Tempa means iron, and it means to strike iron, and it means angry. Shehyn gave him that name years ago. He was a most troublesome student.\u201d\n\u201cIn Aturan temper means angry.\u201d I pointed it out rather excitedly, amazed at the coincidence. \u201cAnd it is also something you do with iron when forging it into steel.\u201d\nVashet shrugged, unimpressed. \u201cThat is the way of names. Tempi is a small name, and still it holds much. That is why you should not speak of yours, even to me.\u201d\n\u201cBut I do not know your language well enough to tell what it means myself,\u201d I protested. \u201cA man should know the meaning of his own name.\u201d\nVashet hesitated, then relented. \u201cIt means flame, and thunder, and broken tree.\u201d\nI thought for a while and decided I liked it. \u201cWhen Magwyn gave it to me, you seemed surprised. Why is that?\u201d\n\u201cIt is not proper for me to comment on another\u2019s name.\u201d Absolute refusal. Her gesture was so sharp it almost hurt to look at. She came to her feet, then brushed her hands against her pants. \u201cCome, it is time you gave your answer to Shehyn.\u201d\n \nShehyn motioned for us to sit as we entered her room. Then she took a seat herself, startling me by showing the smallest of smiles. It was a terribly flattering gesture of familiarity. \u201cHave you decided?\u201d she asked.\nI nodded. \u201cI thank you, Shehyn, but I cannot stay. I must return to Severen to speak with the Maer. Tempi fulfilled his obligation when the road was made safe, but I am bound to return and explain everything that happened.\u201d I thought of Denna as well, but didn\u2019t mention her.\nShehyn gestured an elegant mingling of approval and regret. \u201cFulfilling one\u2019s duty is of the Lethani.\u201d She gave me a serious look. \u201cRemember, you have a sword and a name, but you must not hire yourself out as if you had taken the red.\u201d\n\u201cVashet has explained everything to me,\u201d I said. Reassurance. \u201cI will make arrangements for my sword to be returned to Haert if I am killed. I will not teach the Ketan or wear the red.\u201d Carefully attentive curiosity. \u201cBut I am permitted to tell others I have studied fighting with you?\u201d\nReserved agreement. \u201cYou may say you have studied with us. But not that you are one of us.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd not that I am equal to you.\u201d\nShehyn gestured content satisfaction. Then her hands shifted and she made a small gesture of embarrassed admission. \u201cThis is not entirely a gift,\u201d she said. \u201cYou will be a better fighter than many barbarians. If you fight and win, the barbarians will think: Kvothe studied only slightly the Adem\u2019s arts, and still he is formidable. How much more skilled must they themselves be?\u201d However. \u201cIf you fight and lose, they will think: He only learned a piece of what the Adem know.\u201d\nThe old woman\u2019s eyes twinkled ever so slightly. She gestured amusement. \u201cNo matter what, our reputation thrives. This serves Ademre.\u201d\nI nodded. Willing acceptance. \u201cIt will not hurt my reputation either,\u201d I said. Understatement.\nThere was a pause in the conversation, then Shehyn gestured solemn importance. \u201cWhen we spoke before, you asked me of the Rhinta. Do you remember?\u201d Shehyn asked. From the corner of my eye I saw Vashet shift uncomfortably in her seat.\nSuddenly excited, I nodded.\n\u201cI have remembered a story of such. Would you like to hear it?\u201d\nI gestured extreme eager interest.\n\u201cIt is an old story, old as Ademre. It is always told the same. Are you ready", "to hear it?\u201d Profound formality. There was a hint of ritual in her voice.\nI nodded again. Pleading entreaty.\n\u201cAs with all things, there are rules. I will tell this story once. After, you\nmay not speak of it. After, you may not ask questions.\u201d Shehyn looked back and forth between Vashet and myself. Grave seriousness. \u201cNot until you have slept one thousand nights may you speak on this. Not until you have traveled one thousand miles may you ask questions. Knowing this, are you willing to hear it?\u201d\nI nodded a third time, my excitement rising in me.\nShehyn spoke with great formality. \u201cOnce there was a great realm peopled by great people. They were not Ademre. They were what Ademre was before we became ourselves.\n\u201cBut at this time they were themselves, the women and men fair and strong. They sang songs of power and fought as well as Ademre do.\n\u201cThese people had a great empire. The name of the empire is forgotten. It is not important as the empire has fallen, and since that time the land has broken and the sky changed.\n\u201cIn the empire there were seven cities and one city. The names of the seven cities are forgotten, for they are fallen to treachery and destroyed by time. The one city was destroyed as well, but its name remains. It was called Tariniel.\n\u201cThe empire had an enemy, as strength must have. But the enemy was not great enough to pull it down. Not by pulling or pushing was the enemy strong enough to drag it down. The enemy\u2019s name is remembered, but it will wait.\n\u201cSince not by strength could the enemy win, he moved like a worm in fruit. The enemy was not of the Lethani. He poisoned seven others against the empire, and they forgot the Lethani. Six of them betrayed the cities that trusted them. Six cities fell and their names are forgotten.\n\u201cOne remembered the Lethani, and did not betray a city. That city did not fall. One of them remembered the Lethani and the empire was left with hope. With one unfallen city. But even the name of that city is forgotten, buried in time.\n\u201cBut seven names are remembered. The name of the one and of the six who follow him. Seven names have been carried through the crumbling of empire, through the broken land and changing sky. Seven names are remembered through the long wandering of Ademre. Seven names have been remembered, the names of the seven traitors. Remember them and know", "them by their seven signs:\nCyphus bears the blue flame. Stercus is in thrall of iron. Ferule chill and dark of eye. Usnea lives in nothing but decay. Grey Dalcenti never speaks.\nPale Alenta brings the blight. Last there is the lord of seven: Hated. Hopeless. Sleepless. Sane. Alaxel bears the shadow\u2019s hame.", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-NINE\nInterlude\u2014Din of Whispering\n\u201cRESHI!\u201d BAST CRIED OUT, his face stricken. \u201cNo! Stop!\u201d He held out his hands as if he would press them against the innkeeper\u2019s mouth. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t say such things!\u201d\nKvothe smiled in a humorless way. \u201cBast, who taught you your name lore in the first place?\u201d\n\u201cNot you, Reshi.\u201d Bast shook his head. \u201cThere are things every Fae child knows. It\u2019s never good to speak such things aloud. Not ever.\u201d\n\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d Kvothe prompted in his best teacher\u2019s voice.\n\u201cBecause some things can tell when their names are spoken,\u201d Bast swallowed. \u201cThey can tell where they\u2019re spoken.\u201d\nKvothe gave a somewhat exasperated sigh. \u201cThere\u2019s small harm in saying a name once, Bast.\u201d He sat back in his chair. \u201cWhy do you think the Adem have their traditions surrounding that particular story? Only once and no questions after?\u201d\nBast\u2019s eyes narrowed thoughtfully, and Kvothe gave him a small, tight smile. \u201cExactly. Trying to find someone who speaks your name once is like tracking a man through a forest from a single footprint.\u201d\nChronicler spoke up hesitantly, as if afraid of interrupting. \u201cCan such a thing really be done?\u201d he asked. \u201cTruthfully?\u201d\nKvothe nodded grimly. \u201cI expect that\u2019s how they found my troupe when I was young.\u201d\nChronicler looked around nervously, then frowned and made an obvious effort to stop. The result was that he sat very still, looking every bit as nervous as before. \u201cDoes that mean they might come here? You\u2019ve certainly been talking about them enough. . . .\u201d\nKvothe made a dismissive gesture. \u201cNo. Names are the key. Real names. Deep names. And I have been avoiding them for just that reason. My father was a great one for details. He had been asking questions and digging up old stories about the Chandrian for years. I expect he stumbled onto a few of their", "old names and worked them into his song. . . .\u201d\nUnderstanding washed over Chronicler\u2019s face. \u201c. . . and then rehearsed it\nagain and again.\u201d\nThe innkeeper gave a faint, fond smile. \u201cEndlessly, if I knew him at all. I\nhave no doubt he and my mother did their solid best to work every tiny burr out of their song before they made it public. They were perfectionists.\u201d He gave a tired sigh. \u201cTo the Chandrian, it must have been like someone constantly lighting a signal fire. I expect the only thing that kept them safe for so long was that we were constantly traveling.\u201d\nBast broke in again. \u201cWhich is why you shouldn\u2019t say such things, Reshi.\u201d\nKvothe frowned. \u201cI have slept my thousand nights and traveled several thousand miles since then, Bast. It is safe to say them once. With all the hell that\u2019s breaking loose in the world these days you can believe people are telling old stories more often. If the Chandrian are listening for names, I don\u2019t doubt they\u2019ve got a slow din of whispering from Arueh to the Circle Sea.\u201d\nBast\u2019s expression made it clear he was less than reassured.\n\u201cBesides,\u201d Kvothe said with a bit of a weary sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have them written down. They may prove useful to someone someday.\u201d\n\u201cStill Reshi, you should be more careful.\u201d\n\u201cWhat have I been these last years except for careful, Bast?\u201d Kvothe said, his irritation finally bubbling to the surface. \u201cWhat good has it done me? Besides, if what you say about the Cthaeh is true, then things will end in tears no matter what I do. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\nBast opened his mouth, then closed it, obviously at a loss. Then he darted a look toward Chronicler, his eyes pleading for support.\nSeeing this, Kvothe turned to look at Chronicler as well, raising an eyebrow curiously.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know in the least,\u201d Chronicler said, looking down as he opened his satchel and brought out an ink-stained piece of cloth. \u201cBoth of you have seen the full extent of my naming prowess: Iron. And that is a fluke by all accounts. Master Namer declared me an utter waste of his time.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds familiar,\u201d Kvothe murmured.\nChronicler shrugged. \u201cIn my case I took him at his word.\u201d\n\u201cCan you remember the excuse he gave you?\u201d\n\u201cHe had many specific criticisms: I knew too many words. I\u2019d never been\nhungry. I was too soft. . . .\u201d Chronicler\u2019s hands were busy cleaning the nib of his pen. \u201cI felt he made his overall position clear when he said, \u2018Who would", "have thought a papery little scriv like you could have any iron in him at all?\u2019\u201d Kvothe\u2019s mouth quirked into a sympathetic smile. \u201cDid he really?\u201d Chronicler shrugged. \u201cHe called me a twat, actually. I was trying not to\noffend the innocent ears of our young friend here.\u201d He nodded at Bast. \u201cFrom what I can tell, he\u2019s had a rough day.\u201d\nKvothe smiled in full now. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame we weren\u2019t ever at the University at the same time.\u201d\nChronicler gave the nib one last rub against the soft cloth and held it up to the fading light from the inn\u2019s window. \u201cNot really,\u201d he said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have liked me. I was a papery little twat. And spoiled. And full of myself.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s changed since then?\u201d Kvothe asked.\nChronicler blew air through his nose dismissively. \u201cNot much, depending who you ask. But I like to think I\u2019ve had my eyes opened a bit.\u201d He screwed the nib carefully back into his pen.\n\u201cAnd how did that happen, exactly?\u201d Kvothe asked.\nChronicler looked across the table, seeming surprised at the question. \u201cExactly ?\u201d he asked. \u201cTelling a story isn\u2019t what I\u2019m here for.\u201d He tucked the cloth back into his satchel. \u201cIn brief, I had a snit and left the University looking for greener pasture. Best thing I ever did. I learned more from a month on the road than I had in three years of classes.\u201d\nKvothe nodded. \u201cTeccam said the same thing: No man is brave that has never walked a hundred miles. If you want to know the truth of who you are, walk until not a person knows your name. Travel is the great leveler, the great teacher, bitter as medicine, crueler than mirror-glass. A long stretch of road will teach you more about yourself than a hundred years of quiet introspection.\u201d", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY\nWine and Water\nSAYING MY FAREWELLS IN Haert took an entire day. I shared a meal with Vashet and Tempi and let both of them give me more advice than I needed or desired. Celean cried a bit, and told me she would come visit me when she finally took the red. We bouted one final time, and I suspect she let me win.\nLastly, I spent a pleasant evening with Penthe that turned into a pleasant night and, eventually, into a pleasant late night. I did manage to catch a few hours of sleep in the pale hours before dawn.\nI grew up among the Ruh, so I am endlessly amazed how quickly a person can put down roots in a place. Though I had been in Haert less than two months, it was hard to leave.\nStill, it felt good to be back on the road again, heading toward Alveron and Denna. It was time I collected my reward for a job well done and delivered an earnest and rather belated apology.\nFive days later I was walking one of those long, lonely stretches of road you only find in the low hills of eastern Vintas. I was, as my father used to say, on the edge of the map.\nI had only passed one or two travelers all day and not a single inn. The thought of sleeping outdoors wasn\u2019t particularly troubling, but I had been eating from my pockets for a couple days, and a warm meal would have been a welcome thing.\nNight had nearly fallen, and I had given up hope of something decent in my stomach when I spotted a line of white smoke trailing into the twilight sky ahead of me. I took it for a farmhouse at first. Then I heard a faint strain of music and my hopes for a bed and a hearth-hot meal began to rise.\n \nBut as I came around a curve in the road, I, found a surprise better than any roadside inn.Through the trees I saw a tall campfire flickering between two achingly familiar wagons. Men and women lounged about, talking. One strummed a lute, while another tapped a small tabor idly against his leg. Others were pitching a tent between two trees while an older woman set a tripod over the fire.\nTroupers. What\u2019s better, I recognized familiar markings on the side of one of the wagons. To me they stood out more brightly than the fire. Those signs meant these were true troupers. My family, the Edema Ruh.\nAs I stepped from the trees, one of the men gave a shout, and before I could draw breath to speak there were three swords pointing at me. The sudden stillness after the music and chatter was more than slightly unnerving.\nA handsome man with a black beard and a silver earring took a slow step forward, never taking the tip of his sword off my eye. \u201cOtto!\u201d he shouted into the woods behind me. \u201cIf you\u2019re napping I swear on my mother\u2019s milk I\u2019ll gut you. Who the hell are you?\u201d\nThe last was directed at me. But before I could respond, a voice came out of the trees. \u201cI\u2019m right here, Alleg, as . . . Who\u2019s that? How in the God\u2019s name did he get past me?\u201d\nWhen they\u2019d drawn their swords on me, I\u2019d raised my hands. It\u2019s a good habit to have when anyone points something sharp at you. Nevertheless I was smiling as I spoke. \u201cSorry to startle you, Alleg.\u201d\n\u201cSave it,\u201d he said coldly. \u201cYou have one breath left to tell me why you were sneaking around our camp.\u201d\nI had no need to talk, and instead turned so everyone by the fire could see the lute case slung across my back.\nThe change in Alleg\u2019s attitude was immediate. He relaxed and sheathed his sword. The others followed suit as he smiled and approached me, laughing.\nI laughed too. \u201cOne family.\u201d\n\u201cOne family.\u201d He shook my hand and turned toward the fire, shouting, \u201cBest behavior everyone. We have a guest tonight!\u201d There was a low cheer, and everyone went busily back to whatever they had been doing before I arrived.\nA thick-bodied man wearing a sword stomped out of the trees. \u201cI\u2019ll be damned if he came past me, Alleg. He\u2019s probably from ...\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s from our family,\u201d Alleg interjected smoothly.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Otto said, obviously taken aback. He looked at my lute. \u201cWelcome", "then.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go past, actually,\u201d I lied. When it was dark, my shaed made me\nvery difficult to see. But that wasn\u2019t his fault, and I didn\u2019t want to get him in trouble. \u201cI heard the music and circled around. I thought you might be a different troupe, and I was going to surprise them.\u201d\nOtto gave Alleg a pointed look, then turned and stomped back into the woods.\nAlleg put his arm around my shoulders. \u201cMight I offer you a drink?\u201d\n\u201cA little water, if you can spare it.\u201d\n\u201cNo guest drinks water by our fire,\u201d he protested. \u201cOnly our best wine will\ntouch your lips.\u201d\n\u201cThe water of the Edema is sweeter than wine to those who have been\nupon the road.\u201d I smiled at him.\n\u201cThen have water and wine, each to your desire.\u201d He led me to one of the\nwagons, where there was a water barrel.\nFollowing a tradition older than time, I drank a ladle of water and used a\nsecond to wash my hands and face. Patting my face dry with the sleeve of my shirt, I looked up at him and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be home again.\u201d\nHe clapped me on the back. \u201cCome. Let me introduce you to the rest of your family.\u201d\nFirst were two men of about twenty, both with scruffy beards. \u201cFren and Josh are our two best singers, excepting myself of course.\u201d I shook their hands.\nNext were the two men playing instruments around the fire. \u201cGaskin plays lute. Laren does pipes and tabor.\u201d They smiled at me. Laren struck the head of the tabor with his thumb, and the drum made a mellow tum.\n\u201cThere\u2019s Tim.\u201d Alleg pointed across the fire to a tall, grim man oiling a sword. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve already met Otto. They keep us from falling into danger on the road.\u201d Tim nodded, looking up briefly from his sword.\n\u201cThis is Anne.\u201d Alleg gestured to an older woman with a pinched expression and grey hair pulled back in a bun. \u201cShe keeps us fed and plays mother to us all.\u201d Anne continued to cut carrots, ignoring both of us.\n\u201cAnd far from last is our own sweet Kete, who holds the key to all our hearts.\u201d Kete had hard eyes and a mouth like a thin line, but her expression softened a little when I kissed her hand.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s everyone,\u201d Alleg said with a smile and a little bow. \u201cYour name is?\u201d", "\u201cKvothe.\u201d\n\u201cWelcome, Kvothe. Rest yourself and be at your ease. Is there anything we can do for you?\u201d\n\u201cA bit of that wine you mentioned earlier?\u201d I smiled.\nHe touched the heel of his hand to his forehead. \u201cOf course! Or would you prefer ale?\u201d\nI nodded, and he fetched me a mug.\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d I said after tasting it, seating myself on a convenient stump. He tipped an imaginary hat. \u201cThank you. We were lucky enough to nick it\non our way through Levinshir a couple days ago. How has the road been treating you of late?\u201d\nI stretched backward and sighed. \u201cNot bad for a lone minstrel.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cI take advantage of what opportunities present themselves. I have to be careful since I\u2019m alone.\u201d\nAlleg nodded wisely. \u201cThe only safety we have is in numbers,\u201d he admitted, then nodded to my lute. \u201cWould you favor us with a bit of a song while we\u2019re waiting for Anne to finish dinner?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d I said, setting down my drink. \u201cWhat would you like to hear?\u201d \u201cCan you play \u2018Leave the Town, Tinker\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cCan I?You tell me.\u201d I lifted my lute from its case and began to play. By\nthe chorus, everyone had stopped what they were doing to listen. I even caught sight of Otto near the edge of the trees as he left his lookout to peer toward the fire.\nWhen I was done, everyone applauded enthusiastically. \u201cYou can play it,\u201d Alleg laughed. Then his expression became serious, and he tapped a finger to his mouth. \u201cHow would you like to walk the road with us for a while?\u201d he asked after a moment. \u201cWe could use another player.\u201d\nI took a moment to consider it. \u201cWhich way are you heading?\u201d \u201cEasterly,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m bound for Severen,\u201d I said.\nAlleg shrugged. \u201cWe can make it to Severen,\u201d he said. \u201cSo long as you\ndon\u2019t mind taking the long way around.\u201d\n\u201cI have been away from the family for a long time,\u201d I admitted, looking at\nthe familiar sights around the fire.\n\u201cOne is a bad number for an Edema on the road,\u201d Alleg said persuasively,\nrunning a finger along the edge of his dark beard. I sighed. \u201cAsk me again in the morning.\u201d", "He slapped my knee, grinning. \u201cGood! That means we have all night to convince you.\u201d\nI replaced my lute and excused myself for a call of nature. Coming back, I knelt next to Anne where she sat near the fire. \u201cWhat are you making for us, mother?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cStew,\u201d she said shortly.\nI smiled. \u201cWhat\u2019s in it?\u201d\nAnne squinted at me. \u201cLamb,\u201d she said, as if daring me to challenge the\nfact.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long while since I\u2019ve had lamb, mother. Could I have a taste?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll wait, same as everyone else,\u201d she said sharply.\n\u201cNot even a small taste?\u201d I wheedled, giving her my best ingratiating\nsmile.\nThe old woman drew a breath, then shrugged it away. \u201cFine,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBut it won\u2019t be my fault if your stomach sets to aching.\u201d\nI laughed. \u201cNo, mother. It won\u2019t be your fault.\u201d I reached for the\nlonghandled wooden spoon and drew it out. After blowing on it, I took a bite. \u201cMother!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cThis is the best thing to touch my lips in a full year.\u201d\n\u201cHmph,\u201d she said, squinting at me.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first truth, mother,\u201d I said earnestly. \u201cAnyone who does not enjoy this fine stew is hardly one of the Ruh in my opinion.\u201d\nAnne turned back to stir the pot and shooed me away, but her expression wasn\u2019t as sharp as it had been before.\nAfter stopping by the keg to refill my mug, I returned to my seat. Gaskin leaned forward. \u201cYou\u2019ve given us a song. Is there anything you\u2019d like to hear?\u201d\n\u201cHow about \u2018Piper Wit\u2019?\u201d I asked.\nHis brow furrowed. \u201cI don\u2019t recognize that one.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s about a clever Ruh who outwits a farmer.\u201d\nGaskin shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid not.\u201d\nI bent to pick up my lute. \u201cLet me. It\u2019s a song every one of us should\nknow.\u201d\n\u201cPick something else,\u201d Laren protested. \u201cI\u2019ll play you something on the\npipes. You\u2019ve played for us once already tonight.\u201d\nI smiled at him. \u201cI forgot you piped. You\u2019ll like this one,\u201d I assured him,\n\u201cPiper\u2019s the hero. Besides, you\u2019re feeding my belly, I\u2019ll feed your ears.\u201d Before they could raise any more objections, I started to play, quick and light.", "They laughed through the whole thing. From the beginning when Piper kills the farmer, to the end when he seduces the dead man\u2019s wife and daughter. I left off the last two verses where the townsfolk kill Piper.\nLaren wiped his eyes after I was done. \u201cHeh.You\u2019re right, Kvothe. I\u2019m better off knowing that one. Besides . . .\u201d He shot a look at Kete where she sat across the fire. \u201cIt\u2019s an honest song. Women can\u2019t keep their hands off a piper.\u201d\nKete snorted derisively and rolled her eyes.\nWe talked of small things until Anne announced the stew was done. Everyone fell to, breaking the silence only to compliment Anne on her cooking.\n\u201cHonestly, Anne,\u201d Alleg asked after his second bowl. \u201cDid you lift a little pepper back in Levinshir?\u201d\nAnne looked smug. \u201cWe all need our secrets, dear,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t press a lady.\u201d\nI asked Alleg, \u201cHave times been good for you and yours?\u201d\n\u201cOh certainly,\u201d he said between mouthfuls. \u201cThree days ago Levinshir was especially good to us.\u201d He winked. \u201cYou\u2019ll see how good later.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d\n\u201cIn fact.\u201d He leaned forward conspiratorially. \u201cWe\u2019ve done so well that I feel quite generous. Generous enough to offer you anything you\u2019d like. Anything at all. Ask and it is yours.\u201d He leaned closer and said in a stage whisper, \u201cI want you to know this is a blatant attempt to bribe you into staying on with us. We would make a thick purse off that lovely voice of yours.\u201d\n\u201cNot to mention the songs he could teach us,\u201d Gaskin chimed in.\nAlleg gave a mock snarl. \u201cDon\u2019t help him bargain, boy. I have the feeling this is going to be hard enough as it is.\u201d\nI gave it a little thought. \u201cI suppose I could stay. . . .\u201d I let myself trail off uncertainly.\nAlleg gave a knowing smile. \u201cBut ...\u201d\n\u201cBut I would ask for three things.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, three things.\u201d He looked me up and down. \u201cJust like in one of the\nstories.\u201d\n\u201cIt only seems right,\u201d I urged.\nHe gave a hesitant nod. \u201cI suppose it does. And how long would you travel\nwith us?\u201d", "\u201cUntil no one objects to my leaving.\u201d\n\u201cDoes anyone have any problem with this?\u201d Alleg looked around.\n\u201cWhat if he asks for one of the wagons?\u201d Tim asked. His voice startled me,\nharsh and rasping like two bricks grating together.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t matter, as he\u2019ll be traveling with us,\u201d Alleg argued. \u201cThey belong\nto all of us anyway. And since he can\u2019t leave unless we say so. . . .\u201d\nThere were no objections. Alleg and I shook hands and there was a small\ncheer.\nKete held up her mug. \u201cTo Kvothe and his songs!\u201d she said. \u201cI have a\nfeeling he\u2019ll be worth whatever he costs us.\u201d\nEveryone drank, and I held up my own glass. \u201cI swear on my mother\u2019s\nmilk, none of you will ever make a better deal than the one you made with me tonight.\u201d This evoked a more enthusiastic cheer and everyone drank again.\nWiping his mouth, Alleg looked me in the eye. \u201cSo, what is the first thing you want from us?\u201d\nI lowered my head. \u201cIt\u2019s a little thing really. I don\u2019t have a tent of my own. If I\u2019m going to be traveling with my family . . .\u201d\n\u201cSay no more!\u201d Alleg waved his wooden mug like a king granting a boon. \u201cYou\u2019ll have my own tent, piled with furs and blankets a foot deep!\u201d He made a gesture over the fire to where Fren and Josh sat. \u201cGo set it up for him.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d I protested. \u201cI can manage it myself.\u201d\n\u201cHush, it\u2019s good for them. Makes them feel useful. Speaking of which . . .\u201d He made another gesture at Tim. \u201cBring them out, would you?\u201d\nTim stood and pressed a hand to his stomach. \u201cI\u2019ll do it in a quick minute. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d He turned to walk off into the woods. \u201cI don\u2019t feel very good.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you get for eatin\u2019 like you\u2019re at a trough!\u201d Otto called after him. He turned back to the rest of us. \u201cSomeday he\u2019ll realize he can\u2019t eat more\u2019n me and not feel sick afterward.\u201d\n\u201cSince Tim\u2019s busy painting a tree, I\u2019ll go get them,\u201d Laren said with thinly veiled eagerness.\n\u201cI\u2019m on guard tonight,\u201d Otto said. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll get them,\u201d Kete said, exasperated. She stared the other two back into their seats and walked behind the wagon on my left.\nJosh and Fren came out of the other wagon with a tent, ropes, and stakes.", "\u201cWhere do you want it?\u201d Josh asked.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a question you usually have to ask a man, is it, Josh?\u201d Fren\njoked, nudging his friend with an elbow.\n\u201cI tend to snore,\u201d I warned them. \u201cYou\u2019ll probably want me a little away\nfrom everyone else.\u201d I pointed. \u201cOver between those two trees would be fine.\u201d\n\u201cI mean, with a man, you normally know where they want it, don\u2019t you, Josh?\u201d Fren continued as they wandered off and began to string up the tent.\nKete returned a minute later, leading a pair of lovely young girls. One had a lean body and face, with straight, black hair cut short like a boy\u2019s. The other was more generously rounded, with curling golden hair. Both wore hopeless expressions and looked to be about sixteen.\n\u201cMeet Krin and Ellie,\u201d Kete said, gesturing to the girls.\nAlleg smiled. \u201cThey are one of the ways in which Levinshir was generous to us. Tonight, one of them will be keeping you warm. My gift to you, as the new member in our family.\u201d He made a show of looking them over. \u201cWhich one would you like?\u201d\nI looked from one to the other. \u201cThat\u2019s a hard choice. Let me think on it a little while.\u201d\nKete sat them near the edge of the fire and put a bowl of stew in each of their hands. The girl with the golden hair, Ellie, ate woodenly for a few bites, then slowed to a stop like a toy winding down. Her eyes looked almost blind, as if she were watching something none of us could see. Krin\u2019s eyes, on the other hand, were focused fiercely into the fire. She sat stiffly with her bowl in her lap.\n\u201cGirls,\u201d Alleg chided. \u201cDon\u2019t you know that things will get better as soon as you start cooperating?\u201d Ellie took another slow bite, then stopped. Krin stared into the fire, her back stiff, her expression hard.\nFrom where she sat by the fire, Anne prodded at them with her wooden spoon. \u201cEat!\u201d The response was the same as before. One slow bite. One tense rebellion. Scowling, Anne leaned closer and gripped the dark-haired girl firmly by the chin, her other hand reaching for the bowl of stew.\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I urged. \u201cThey\u2019ll eat when they get hungry enough. \u201dAlleg looked up at me curiously. \u201cI know what I\u2019m talking about. Give them something to drink instead.\u201d\nThe old woman looked for a moment as if she might continue anyway, then shrugged and let go of Krin\u2019s jaw. \u201cFine. I\u2019m sick of force-feeding this", "one anyway. She\u2019s been nothing but trouble.\u201d\nKete sniffed in agreement. \u201cLittle bitch came at me when I untied her for\nher bath,\u201d she said, brushing her hair away from the side of her face to reveal scratch marks. \u201cAlmost took out my damn eye.\u201d\n\u201cDid a runner, too,\u201d Anne said, still scowling. \u201cI\u2019ve had to start doping her at night.\u201d She made a disgusted gesture. \u201cLet her starve if she wants.\u201d\nLaren came back to the fire with two mugs, setting them in the girl\u2019s unresisting hands.\n\u201cWater?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cAle,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be better for them if they aren\u2019t eating.\u201d\nI stifled my protest. Ellie drank in the same vacant manner in which she\nhad eaten. Krin moved her eyes from the fire, to the cup, to me. I felt an almost physical shock at her resemblance to Denna. Still looking at me, she drank. Her hard eyes gave away nothing of what was happening inside her head.\n\u201cBring them over to sit by me,\u201d I said. \u201cIt might help me to make up my mind.\u201d\nKete brought them over. Ellie was docile. Krin was stiff.\n\u201cBe careful with this one,\u201d Kete said, nodding to the dark-haired girl. \u201cShe\u2019s a scratcher.\u201d\nTim came back looking a little pale. He sat by the fire where Otto nudged him with an elbow. \u201cWant some more stew?\u201d he asked maliciously.\n\u201cSod off,\u201dTim rasped weakly.\n\u201cA little ale might settle your stomach,\u201d I advised.\nHe nodded, seeming eager for anything that might help him. Kete fetched\nhim a fresh mugful.\nBy this time the girls were sitting on either side of me, facing the fire.\nCloser, I saw things I had missed before. There was a dark bruise on the back of Krin\u2019s neck. The blonde girl\u2019s wrists were merely chafed from being tied, but Krin\u2019s were raw and scabbed. For all that, they smelled clean. Their hair was brushed and their clothes had been washed recently. Kete had been tending to them.\nThey were also much more lovely up close. I reached out to touch their shoulders. Krin flinched, then stiffened. Ellie didn\u2019t react at all.\nFrom off in the direction of the trees Fren called out, \u201cIt\u2019s done. Do you want us to light a lamp for you?\u201d\n\u201cYes, please,\u201d I called back. I looked from one girl to the other and then to", "Alleg. \u201cI cannot decide between the two,\u201d I told him honestly. \u201cSo I will have both.\u201d\nAlleg laughed incredulously. Then, seeing I was serious, he protested, \u201cOh come now. That\u2019s hardly fair to the rest of us. Besides, you can\u2019t possibly. . . .\u201d\nI gave him a frank look.\n\u201cWell,\u201d he hedged, \u201cEven if you can, it . . .\u201d\n\u201cThis is the second thing I ask for,\u201d I said formally. \u201cBoth of them.\u201d Otto made a cry of protest that was echoed in the expressions of Gaskin\nand Laren.\nI smiled reassuringly at them. \u201cOnly for tonight.\u201d\nFren and Josh came back from setting up my tent. \u201cBe thankful he didn\u2019t\nask for you, Otto,\u201d Fren said to the big man. \u201cThat\u2019s what Josh would have asked for, isn\u2019t it Josh?\u201d\n\u201cShut your hole, Fren,\u201d Otto said, exasperated. \u201cNow I feel ill.\u201d\nI stood and slung my lute over one shoulder. Then I led both lovely girls, one golden and one dark, toward my tent.", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-ONE\nBlack by Moonlight\nFREN AND JOSH HAD done a good job with the tent. It was tall enough to stand in the center, but still crowded with me and both girls standing. I gave the golden-haired one, Ellie, a gentle push toward the bed of thick blankets. \u201cSit down,\u201d I said gently.\nWhen she didn\u2019t respond, I took her by the shoulders and eased her into a sitting position. She let herself be moved, but her blue eyes were wide and vacant. I checked her head for any signs of a wound. Not finding any, I guessed she was in deep shock.\nI took a moment and dug through my travel sack, then shook some powdered leaf into my traveling cup and added some water from my waterskin. I set the cup into Ellie\u2019s hands, and she took hold of it absently. \u201cDrink it,\u201d I encouraged, trying to capture the tone of voice Felurian had used to gain my thoughtless compliance from time to time.\nIt may have worked, or perhaps she was just thirsty. Whatever the reason, Ellie drained the cup to the bottom. Her eyes still held the same faraway look they had before.\nI shook another measure of the powdered leaf into the cup, refilled it with water, and held it out for the dark-haired girl to drink.\nWe stayed there for several minutes, my arm outstretched, her arms motionless at her sides. Finally she blinked, her eyes focusing on me. \u201cWhat did you give her?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cCrushed velia,\u201d I said gently. \u201cIt\u2019s a countertoxin. There was poison in the stew.\u201d\nHer eyes told me she didn\u2019t believe me. \u201cI didn\u2019t eat any of the stew.\u201d\n\u201cIt was in the ale too. I saw you drink that.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to die.\u201d\nI gave a deep sigh. \u201cIt won\u2019t kill you. It\u2019ll just make you miserable. You\u2019ll\nthrow up and be weak with muscle cramps for a day or two.\u201d I raised the cup, offering it to her.", "\u201cWhy do you care if they kill me?\u201d she asked tonelessly. \u201cIf they don\u2019t do it now they\u2019ll do it later. I\u2019d rather die. . . .\u201d She clenched her teeth before she finished the sentence.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t poison you. I poisoned them and you happened to get some of it. I\u2019m sorry, but this will help you over the worst of it.\u201d\nKrin\u2019s gaze wavered for a second, then became iron hard again. She looked at the cup, then fixed her gaze on me. \u201cIf it\u2019s harmless, you drink it.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I explained. \u201cIt would put me to sleep, and I have things to do tonight.\u201d\nKrin\u2019s eyes darted to the bed of furs laid out on the floor of the tent.\nI smiled my gentlest, saddest smile. \u201cNot those sorts of things.\u201d\nShe still didn\u2019t move. We stood there for a long while. I heard a muted\nretching sound from off in the woods. I sighed and lowered the cup. Looking down, I saw Ellie had already curled up and gone to sleep. Her face looked almost peaceful.\nI took a deep breath and looked back up at Krin. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any reason to trust me,\u201d I said, looking straight into her eyes. \u201cNot after what has happened to you. But I hope you will.\u201d I held out the cup again.\nShe met my eyes without blinking, then reached for the cup. She drank it off in one swallow, choked a little, and sat down. Her eyes stayed hard as marble as she stared at the wall of the tent. I sat down, slightly apart from her.\nIn fifteen minutes she was asleep. I covered the two of them with a blanket and watched their faces. In sleep they were even more beautiful than before. I reached out to brush a strand of hair from Krin\u2019s cheek. To my surprise, she opened her eyes and stared at me. Not the marble stare she had given me before, she looked at me with the dark eyes of a young Denna.\nI froze with my hand on her cheek. We watched each other for a second. Then her eyes drew closed again. I couldn\u2019t tell if it was the drug pulling her under, or her own will surrendering to sleep.\nI settled myself at the entrance of the tent and lay Caesura across my knees. I felt rage like a fire inside me, and the sight of the two sleeping girls was like a wind fanning the coals. I set my teeth and forced myself to think of what had happened here, letting the fire burn fiercely, letting the heat of it fill me. I drew deep breaths, tempering myself for what was to come.\n \nI waited for three hours, listening to the sounds of the camp. Muted conversation drifted toward me, shapes of sentences with no individual words. They faded, mixing with cursing and sounds of people being ill. I took long, slow breaths as Vashet had shown me, relaxing my body, slowly counting my exhalations.\nThen, opening my eyes, I looked at the stars and judged the time to be right. I slowly unfolded myself from my sitting position and made a long, slow stretch. There was a solid crescent of moon hanging in the sky, and everything seemed very bright.\nI approached the campfire slowly. It had fallen to sullen coals that did little to light the space between the two wagons. Otto was there, his huge body slumped against one of the wheels. I smelled vomit. \u201cIs that you, Kvothe?\u201d he asked blurrily.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I continued my slow walk toward him.\n\u201cThat bitch Anne didn\u2019t let the lamb cook through,\u201d he moaned. \u201cI swear to holy God I\u2019ve never been this sick before.\u201d He looked up at me. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d\nCaesura leapt, caught the moonlight briefly on her blade, and tore his throat. He staggered to one knee, then toppled to his side, his hands staining black as they clutched his neck. I left him bleeding darkly in the moonlight, unable to cry out, dying but not dead.\nI tossed a piece of brittle iron into the coals of the fire and headed toward the other tents.\nLaren startled me as I came around the wagon. He made a surprised noise as he saw me walk around the corner with my naked sword. But the poison had made him sluggish, and he had barely managed to raise his hands before Caesura took him in the chest. He choked a scream as he fell backward, writhing on the ground.\nNone of them had been sleeping soundly due to the poison, so Laren\u2019s cry set them pouring from the wagons and tents, staggering and looking around wildly. Two indistinct shapes that I knew must be Josh and Fren leapt from the open back of the wagon closest to me. I struck one in the eye before he hit the ground and tore the belly from the other.\nEveryone saw, and now there were screams in earnest. Most of them began to run drunkenly into the trees, some falling as they went. But the tall shape of Tim hurled itself at me. The heavy sword he had been sharpening all", "evening glinted silver in the moonlight.\nBut I was ready. I slid a second long, brittle piece of sword-iron into my\nhand and muttered a binding. Then, just as he came close enough to strike I snapped the iron sharply between my fingers. His sword shattered with the sound of a broken bell, and the pieces tumbled and disappeared in the dark grass.\nTim was more experienced than me, stronger, and with longer reach. Even poisoned and with half a sword he made a good showing of himself. It took me nearly half a minute before I snuck past his guard with Lover Out the Window and severed his hand at the wrist.\nHe fell to his knees, letting out a raspy howl and clutching at the stump. I struck him high in the chest and headed for the trees. The fight hadn\u2019t taken long, but every second was vital, as the others were already scattering into the woods.\nI hurried in the direction I\u2019d seen one of the dark shapes stagger. I was careless, so when Alleg threw himself on me from the shadow of a tree he caught me unaware. He didn\u2019t have a sword, only a small knife flashing in the moonlight as he dove for me. But a knife is enough to kill a man. He stabbed me in the stomach as we rolled to the ground. I struck the side of my head against a root and tasted blood.\nI fought my way to my feet before he did and cut the hamstring on his leg. Then I stabbed him in the stomach and left him cursing on the ground as I went to hunt the others. I held one hand tight across my stomach. I knew the pain would hit me soon, and after that I might not have long to live.\nIt was a long night, and I will not trouble you with any further details. I found all the rest of them as they made their way through the forest. Anne had broken her leg in her reckless flight, and Tim made it nearly half a mile despite the loss of his hand and the wound in his chest. They shouted and cursed and begged for mercy as I stalked them through the forest, but nothing they said could appease me.\nIt was a terrible night, but I found them all. There was no honor to it, no glory. But there was justice of a sort, and blood, and in the end I brought their bodies back.\n \n I came back to my tent as the sky was beginning to color to a familiar blue. A sharp, hot line of pain burned a few inches below my navel, and I could tell from the unpleasant tugging when I moved that dried blood had matted my shirt to the wound. I ignored the feeling as best I could, knowing I could do nothing for myself with my hands shaking and no decent light to see by. I\u2019d have to wait for dawn to see how badly I was hurt.\nI tried not to dwell on what I knew from my work in the Medica. Any deep wound to the gut promises a long, painful trip to the grave. A skilled physicker with the right equipment could make a difference, but I couldn\u2019t be farther from civilization. I might as well wish for a piece of the moon.\nI wiped my sword, sat in the wet grass in front of the tent, and began to think.", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-TWO\nThe Broken Circle\nI HAD BEEN BUSY FOR more than an hour when the sun finally peered over the tops of the trees and began to burn the dew from the grass. I had found a flat rock and was using it as a makeshift anvil to hammer a spare horseshoe into a different shape. Above the fire a pot of oats was boiling.\nI was just putting the finishing touches on the horseshoe when I saw a flicker of movement from the corner of my eye. It was Krin peeking around the corner of the wagon. I guessed I\u2019d woken her with the sound of hammering iron.\n\u201cOh my God.\u201d Her hand went to her mouth and she took a couple stunned steps out from behind the wagon. \u201cYou killed them.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said simply, my voice sounding dead in my ears.\nKrin\u2019s eyes ran up and down my body, staring at my torn and bloody shirt. \u201cAre . . .\u201d Her voice caught in her throat, and she swallowed. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d\nI nodded silently. When I\u2019d finally worked up the courage to examine my wound, I\u2019d discovered that Felurian\u2019s cloak had saved my life. Instead of spilling open my guts, Alleg\u2019s knife had merely given me a long, shallow cut across my belly. He had also ruined a perfectly good shirt, but I had a hard time feeling bad about that, all things considered.\nI examined the horseshoe, then used a damp leather strap to tie it firmly to one end of a long, straight branch. I pulled the kettle of oats off the fire and thrust the horseshoe into the coals.\nSeeming to recover from some of her shock, Krin slowly approached, eyeing the row of bodies on the other side of the fire. I had done nothing other than lay them out in a rough line. It wasn\u2019t tidy. Blood stained the bodies, and their wounds gaped openly. Krin stared as if she were afraid they might start to move again.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked finally.\nIn answer, I pulled the now-hot horseshoe from the coals of the fire and", "approached the nearest body. It was Tim. I pressed the hot iron against the back of his remaining hand. The skin smoked and hissed and stuck to the metal. After a moment I pulled it away, leaving a black burn against his white skin. A broken circle. I moved back to the fire and began to heat the iron again.\nKrin stood mutely, too stunned to react normally. Not that there could be a normal way to react in a situation like this, I suppose. But she didn\u2019t scream or run off as I thought she might. She simply looked at the broken circle and repeated, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\nWhen I finally spoke, my voice sounded strange to my own ears. \u201cAll of the Edema Ruh are one family,\u201d I explained. \u201cLike a closed circle. It doesn\u2019t matter if some of us are strangers to others, we are still family, still close. We have to be this way, because we are always strangers wherever we go. We are scattered, and people hate us.\n\u201cWe have laws. Rules we follow. When one of us does a thing that cannot be forgiven or mended, if he jeopardizes the safety or the honor of the Edema Ruh, he is killed and branded with the broken circle to show he is no longer one of us. It is rarely done. There is rarely a need.\u201d\nI pulled the iron from the fire and walked to the next body. Otto. I pressed it to the back of his hand and listened to it hiss. \u201cThese were not Edema Ruh. But they made themselves out to be. They did things no Edema would do, so I am making sure the world knows they were not part of our family. The Ruh do not do the sort of things that these men did.\u201d\n\u201cBut the wagons,\u201d she protested. \u201cThe instruments.\u201d\n\u201cThey were not Edema Ruh,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cThey probably weren\u2019t even real troupers, just a group of thieves who killed a band of Ruh and tried to take their place.\u201d\nKrin stared at the bodies, then back at me. \u201cSo you killed them for pretending to be Edema Ruh?\u201d\n\u201cFor pretending to be Ruh? No.\u201d I put the iron back in the fire. \u201cFor killing a Ruh troupe and stealing their wagons? Yes. For what they did to you? Yes.\u201d\n\u201cBut if they aren\u2019t Ruh . . .\u201d Krin looked at the brightly painted wagons. \u201cHow?\u201d\n\u201cI am curious about that myself,\u201d I said. Pulling the broken circle from the fire again, I moved to Alleg and pressed it onto his palm.\nThe false trouper jerked and screamed himself awake. \u201cHe isn\u2019t dead!\u201d Krin exclaimed shrilly.", "I had examined the wound earlier. \u201cHe\u2019s dead,\u201d I said coldly. \u201cHe just hasn\u2019t stopped moving yet.\u201d I turned to look him in the eye. \u201cHow about it, Alleg? How did you come by a pair of Edema wagons?\u201d\n\u201cRuh bastard,\u201d he cursed at me with blurry defiance.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, \u201cI am. And you are not. So how did you learn my family\u2019s signs and customs?\u201d\n\u201cHow did you know?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe knew the words, the handshake. We knew water and wine and songs before supper. How did you know?\u201d\n\u201cYou thought you could fool me?\u201d I said, feeling my anger coiling inside me again like a spring. \u201cThis is my family! How could I not know? Ruh don\u2019t do what you did. Ruh don\u2019t steal, don\u2019t kidnap girls.\u201d\nAlleg shook his head with a mocking smile. There was blood on his teeth. \u201cEveryone knows what you people do.\u201d\nMy temper exploded. \u201cEveryone thinks they know! They think rumor is the truth! Ruh don\u2019t do this!\u201d I gestured wildly around me. \u201cPeople only think those things because of people like you!\u201d My anger flared even hotter and I found myself screaming. \u201cNow tell me what I want to know or God will weep when he hears what I\u2019ve done to you!\u201d\nAlleg paled and had to swallow before he found his voice. \u201cThere was an old man and his wife and a couple other players. I traveled guard with them for half a year. Eventually they took me in.\u201d He ran out of breath and gasped a bit as he tried to get it back.\nHe\u2019d said enough. \u201cSo you killed them.\u201d\nAlleg shook his head vigorously. \u201cNo . . . were attacked on the road.\u201d He gestured weakly to the other bodies. \u201cThey surprised us. The other players were killed, but I was just . . . knocked out.\u201d\nI looked over the line of bodies and felt the rage flare up, even though I\u2019d already known. There was no other way these people could have come by a pair of Edema wagons with their markings intact.\nAlleg was talking again. \u201cI showed them afterward ... How to act like a troupe.\u201d He swallowed against the pain. \u201cGood life.\u201d\nI turned away, disgusted. He was one of us, in a way. One of our adopted family. It made everything ten times worse knowing that. I pushed the horseshoe into the coals of the fire again, then looked to the girl as it heated. Her eyes had gone to flint as she watched Alleg.\nNot sure if it was the right thing to do, I offered her the brand. Her face went hard and she took it.", "Alleg didn\u2019t seem to understand what was about to happen until she had the hot iron against his chest. He shrieked and twisted but lacked the strength to get away as she pressed it hard against him. She grimaced as he struggled weakly against the iron, her eyes brimming with angry tears.\nAfter a long minute she pulled the iron away and stood, crying quietly. I let her be.\nAlleg looked up at her and somehow managed to find his voice. \u201cAh girl, we had some good times, didn\u2019t we?\u201d She stopped crying and looked at him. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2014\u201d\nI kicked him sharply in the side before he could say anything else. He stiffened in mute pain and then spat blood at me. I landed another kick, and he went limp.\nNot knowing what else to do, I took back the brand and began heating it again.\nThere was a long silence. \u201cIs Ellie still asleep?\u201d I asked.\nKrin nodded.\n\u201cDo you think it would help for her to see this?\u201d\nShe thought about it, wiping at her face with a hand. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she\nsaid finally. \u201cI don\u2019t think she could see it right now. She\u2019s not right in her head.\u201d\n\u201cThe two of you are from Levinshir?\u201d I asked to keep the silence at arm\u2019s length.\n\u201cMy family farms just north of Levinshir,\u201d Krin said. \u201cEllie\u2019s father is mayor.\u201d\n\u201cWhen did these come into your town?\u201d I asked as I set the brand to the back of another hand. The sweet smell of charred flesh was becoming thick in the air.\n\u201cWhat day is it?\u201d\nI counted in my head. \u201cFelling.\u201d\n\u201cThey came into town on Theden.\u201d She paused. \u201cFive days ago?\u201d Her\nvoice was tinged with disbelief. \u201cWe were glad to have the chance to see a play and hear the news. Hear some music.\u201d She looked down. \u201cThey were camped on the east edge of town. When I came to get my fortune read they told me to come back that night. They seemed so friendly, so exciting.\u201d\nKrin looked at the wagons. \u201cWhen I showed up, they were all sitting around the fire. They sang me songs. The old woman gave me some tea. I didn\u2019t even think . . . I mean . . . she looked like my gran.\u201d Her eyes strayed", "to the body of the old woman, then away. \u201cThen I don\u2019t remember what happened. I woke up in the dark, in one of the wagons. I was tied up and I . . .\u201d Her voice broke a little, and she rubbed absentmindedly at her wrists. She glanced back at the tent. \u201cI guess Ellie got an invitation too.\u201d\nI finished branding the backs of their hands. I had been planning to do their faces too, but the iron was slow to heat in the fire, and I was quickly growing sick of the work. I hadn\u2019t slept at all, and the anger that had burned so hot for so long was in its final flicker, leaving me feeling cold and numb.\nI made a gesture to the pot of oats I\u2019d pulled off the fire. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, then darted a look toward the bodies. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cMe neither. Go wake up Ellie and we can get you home.\u201d\nKrin hurried off to the tent. After she disappeared inside, I turned to the\nline of bodies. \u201cDoes anyone object to my leaving the troupe?\u201d I asked. None of them did. So I left.", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-THREE\nDreams\nIT WAS AN HOUR\u2019S work to drive the wagons into a thick piece of forest and hide them. I destroyed their Edema markings and unhitched the horses. There was only one saddle, so I loaded the other two horses with food and whatever other portable valuables I could find.\nWhen I returned with the horses, Krin and Ellie were waiting for me. More precisely, Krin was waiting. Ellie was merely standing nearby, her expression vacant, her eyes empty.\n\u201cDo you know how to ride?\u201d I asked Krin.\nShe nodded and I handed her the reins to the saddled horse. She got one foot in the stirrup and stopped, shaking her head. She brought her foot back down slowly. \u201cI\u2019ll walk.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think Ellie would stay on a horse?\u201d\nKrin looked over to where the blonde girl was standing. One of the horses nuzzled her curiously and got no response. \u201cProbably. But I don\u2019t think it would be good for her. After . . .\u201d\nI nodded in understanding. \u201cWe\u2019ll all walk then.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is the heart of the Lethani?\u201d I asked Vashet.\n\u201cSuccess and right action.\u201d\n\u201cWhich is the more important, success or rightness?\u201d\n\u201cThey are the same. If you act rightly success follows.\u201d\n\u201cBut others may succeed by doing wrong things,\u201d I pointed out.\n\u201cWrong things never lead to success,\u201d Vashet said firmly. \u201cIf a man acts\nwrongly and succeeds, that is not the way. Without the Lethani there is no true success.\u201d\nSir? A voice called. \u201cSir?\u201d\n \nMy eyes focused on Krin. Her hair was windblown, her young face tired. She looked at me timidly. \u201cSir? It\u2019s getting dark.\u201d\nI looked around and saw twilight creeping in from the east. I was bone weary and had fallen into a walking doze after we had stopped for lunch at midday.\n\u201cJust call me Kvothe, Krin. Thanks for jogging my elbow. My mind was somewhere else.\u201d\nKrin gathered wood and started a fire. I unsaddled the horses, then fed and rubbed them down. I took a few minutes to set up the tent, too. Normally I don\u2019t bother with such things, but there had been room for it on the horses, and I guessed the girls weren\u2019t used to sleeping out of doors.\nAfter I finished with the tent, I realized I\u2019d only brought one extra blanket from the troupe\u2019s supplies. There would be a chill tonight too, if I was any judge of such things.\n\u201cDinner\u2019s ready,\u201d I heard Krin call. I tossed my blanket and the spare one into the tent and headed back to where she was finishing up. She\u2019d done a good job with what was available. Potato soup with bacon and toasted bread. There was a green summer squash nestled into the coals as well.\nEllie worried me. She had been the same all day, walking listlessly, never speaking or responding to anything Krin or I said to her. Her eyes would follow things, but there was no thought behind them. Krin and I had discovered the hard way that if left to herself she would stop walking, or wander off the road if something caught her eye.\nKrin handed me a bowl and spoon as I sat down. \u201cIt smells good.\u201d I complimented her.\nShe half-smiled and dished a second bowl for herself. She started to fill a third bowl, then hesitated, realizing Ellie couldn\u2019t feed herself.\n\u201cWould you like some soup, Ellie?\u201d I asked in normal tones. \u201cIt smells good.\u201d\nShe sat blankly by the fire, staring into nothing.\n\u201cDo you want to share mine?\u201d I asked as if it were the most natural thing in the world. I moved closer to her and blew on a spoonful to cool it. \u201cHere you go.\u201d\nEllie ate it mechanically, turning her head slightly in my direction, toward the spoon. Her eyes reflected the dancing patterns of the fire. They were like the windows of an empty house.\nI blew on another spoonful and held it out to the blonde girl. She opened", "her mouth only when the spoon touched her lips. I moved my head, trying to see past the dancing firelight in her eyes, desperately hoping to see something behind them. Anything.\n\u201cI bet you\u2019re an Ell, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I said conversationally. I looked at Krin. \u201cShort for Ellie?\u201d\nKrin shrugged helplessly. \u201cWe weren\u2019t friends, really. She\u2019s just Ellie Anwater. The mayor\u2019s daughter.\u201d\n\u201cIt sure was a long walk today,\u201d I continued speaking in the same easy tone. \u201cHow do your feet feel, Krin?\u201d\nKrin continued to watch me with her serious dark eyes. \u201cA little sore.\u201d \u201cMine too. I can\u2019t wait to get my shoes off. Are your feet sore, Ell?\u201d No response. I fed her another bite.\n\u201cIt was pretty hot too. It should cool off tonight, though. Good sleeping\nweather. Won\u2019t that be nice, Ell?\u201d\nNo response. Krin continued to watch me from the other side of the fire. I\ntook a bite of soup for myself. \u201cThis is truly fine, Krin,\u201d I said earnestly, then turned back to the vacant girl. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing we have Krin to cook for us, Ell. Everything I cook tastes like horseshit.\u201d\nOn her side of the fire, Krin tried to laugh with a mouthful of soup with predictable results. I thought I saw a flicker in Ell\u2019s eyes. \u201cIf I had some horse apples I could make us a horse apple pie for dessert,\u201d I offered. \u201cI could make some tonight if you want . . .\u201d I trailed off, making it a question.\nEll gave the slightest frown, a small wrinkle creased her forehead.\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably right,\u201d I said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be very good. Would you like more soup instead?\u201d\nThe barest nod. I gave her a spoonful.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little salty, though. You probably want some water.\u201d\nAnother nod. I handed her the waterskin and she lifted it to her own lips.\nShe drank for a long, long minute. She was probably parched from our long walk today. I would have to watch her more closely tomorrow to make sure she drank enough.\n\u201cWould you like a drink, Krin?\u201d\n\u201cYes please,\u201d Krin said, her eyes fixed on Ell\u2019s face.\nMoving automatically, Ell held the waterskin out toward Krin, holding it\ndirectly over the fire with the shoulder strap dragging in the coals. Krin grabbed it quickly, then added a belated, \u201cThank you, Ell.\u201d\nI kept the slow stream of conversation going through the whole meal. Ell", "fed herself toward the end of it, and though her eyes were clearer, it was as if she were looking at the world through a sheet of frosted glass, seeing but not seeing. Still, it was an improvement.\nAfter she ate two bowls of soup and half a loaf of bread, her eyes began to bob closed. \u201cWould you like to go to sleep, Ell?\u201d I asked.\nA more definite nod.\n\u201cShould I carry you to the tent?\u201d\nHer eyes snapped open at this and she shook her head firmly.\n\u201cMaybe Krin would help you get ready for bed if you asked her.\u201d\nEll turned to look in Krin\u2019s direction. Her mouth moved in a vague way.\nKrin darted a glance at me and I nodded.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go and get tucked in then,\u201d Krin said, sounding every bit the older\nsister. She came over and took Ell\u2019s hand, helping her to her feet. As they went into the tent, I finished off the soup and ate a piece of bread that had been too badly burnt for either of the girls.\nBefore too long Krin came back to the fire. \u201cIs she sleeping?\u201d I asked. \u201cBefore she hit the pillow. Do you think she will be all right?\u201d\nShe was in deep shock. Her mind had stepped through the doors of\nmadness to protect itself from what was happening. \u201cIt\u2019s probably just a matter of time,\u201d I said tiredly, hoping it was the truth. \u201cThe young heal quickly.\u201d I chuckled humorlessly as I realized she was probably only about a year younger than me. I felt every year twice tonight, some of them three times.\nDespite the fact that I felt covered in lead, I forced myself to my feet and helped Krin clean the dishes. I sensed her growing unease as we finished cleaning up and repicketing the horses to a fresh piece of grazing. The tension grew worse as we approached the tent. I stopped and held the flap open for her. \u201cI\u2019ll sleep out here tonight.\u201d\nHer relief was tangible. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\nI nodded. She slipped inside, and I let the flap fall closed behind her. Her head poked back out almost immediately, followed by a hand holding a blanket.\nI shook my head. \u201cYou\u2019ll need them both. There\u2019ll be a chill tonight.\u201d I pulled my shaed around me and lay directly in front of the tent. I didn\u2019t want Ell wandering out during the night and getting lost or hurt.\n\u201cWon\u2019t you be cold?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I said. I was tired enough to sleep on a running horse. I was", "tired enough to sleep under a running horse.\nKrin ducked her head back into the tent. Soon I heard her nestling into the\nblankets. Then everything was quiet.\nI remembered the startled look on Otto\u2019s face as I cut his throat. I heard\nAlleg struggle weakly and curse me as I dragged him back to the wagons. I remembered the blood. The way it had felt against my hands. The thickness of it.\nI had never killed anyone like that before. Not coldly, not close up. I remembered how warm their blood had been. I remembered the way Kete had cried as I stalked her through the woods. \u201cIt was them or me!\u201d she had screamed hysterically. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a choice. It was them or me!\u201d\nI lay awake a long while. When I finally slept, the dreams were worse.", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-FOUR\nThe Road to Levinshir\nWE MADE POOR TIME the next day, as Krin and I were forced to lead the three horses and Ell besides. Luckily, the horses were well-behaved, as Edema-trained horses tend to be. If they had been as wayward-witted as the poor mayor\u2019s daughter, we might never have made it to Levinshir at all.\nEven so, the horses were almost more trouble than they were worth. The glossy roan in particular liked to wander off into the underbrush, foraging. Three times now I\u2019d had to drag him out, and we were irritated with each other. I\u2019d named him Burrback for obvious reasons.\nThe fourth time I had to pull him back onto the road, I seriously considered cutting him loose to save myself the trouble. I didn\u2019t, of course. A good horse is the same as money in your pocket. And it would be quicker to ride back to Severen than walk the whole way.\nKrin and I did our best to keep Ell engaged in conversation as we walked. It seemed to help a bit. And by the time our noon meal came around she seemed almost aware of what was going on around her. Almost.\nI had an idea as we were getting ready to set out again after lunch. I led our dappled grey mare over to where Ell stood. Her golden hair was one great tangle and she was trying to run one of her hands through it while her eyes wandered around in a distracted way, as if she didn\u2019t quite understand where she was.\n\u201cEll.\u201d She turned to look. \u201cHave you met Greytail?\u201d I gestured to the mare. A faint, confused shake of the head.\n\u201cI need your help leading her. Have you led a horse before?\u201d\nA nod.\n\u201cShe needs someone to take care of her. Can you do it?\u201d Greytail looked at me with one large eye, as if to let me know she needed leading as much as I needed wheels to walk. But then she lowered her head a bit and nuzzled Ell in a motherly way. The girl reached out a hand to pet her nose almost automatically, then took the reins from me.", "\u201cDo you think that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d Krin asked when I came back to pack the other horses.\n\u201cGreytail is gentle as a lamb.\u201d\n\u201cJust because Ell is witless as a sheep,\u201d Krin said archly, \u201cdoesn\u2019t make them a good pairing.\u201d\nI cracked a smile at that. \u201cWe\u2019ll watch them close for an hour or so. If it doesn\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t. But sometimes the best help a person can find is helping someone else.\u201d\nSince I had slept poorly I was twice weary today. My stomach was sour, and I felt gritty, like someone had sanded the first two layers of my skin away. I was almost tempted to doze in the saddle, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to ride while the girls walked.\nSo I plodded along, leading my horse and nodding on my feet. But today I couldn\u2019t fall into the comfortable half-sleep I tend to use when walking. I was plagued with thoughts of Alleg, wondering if he was still alive.\nI knew from my time in the Medica that the gut wound I\u2019d given him was fatal. I also knew it was a slow death. Slow and painful. With proper care it might be a full span of days before he died. Even alone in the middle of nowhere he could live for days with such a wound.\nNot pleasant days. He would grow delirious with fever as the infection set in. Every movement would tear the wound open again. He couldn\u2019t walk on his hamstrung leg, either. So if he wanted to move he\u2019d have to crawl. He would be cramped with hunger and burning with thirst by now.\nBut not dead from thirst. No. I had left a full waterskin nearby. I had laid it at his side before we had left. Not out of kindness. Not to make his last hours more bearable. I had left it because I knew that with water he would live longer, suffer more.\nLeaving him that waterskin was the most terrible thing I\u2019d ever done, and now that my anger had cooled to ashes I regretted it. I wondered how much longer he would live because of it. A day? Two? Certainly no more than two. I tried not to think of what those two days would be like.\nBut even when I forced thoughts of Alleg from my mind, I had other demons to fight. I remembered bits and pieces of that night, the things the\n \nfalse troupers had said as I cut them down. The sounds my sword had made as it dug into them. The smell of their skin as I had branded them. I had killed two women. What would Vashet think of my actions? What would anyone think?\nExhausted from worry and lack of sleep, my thoughts spun in these circles for the remainder of the day. I set up camp from force of habit and kept up a conversation with Ell through an effort of sheer will. The time for sleep came before I was ready, and I found myself rolled in my shaed, in the front of the girls\u2019 tent. I was dimly aware that Krin had started giving me the same worried look she\u2019d been giving Ell for the past two days.\nI lay wide-eyed for an hour before falling asleep, wondering about Alleg.\nWhen I slept I dreamed of killing them. In my dream I stalked the forest like grim death, unwavering.\nBut it was different this time. I killed Otto, his blood spattering my hands like hot grease. Then I killed Laren and Josh and Tim. They moaned and screamed, twisting on the ground. Their wounds were horrible, but I could not look away.\nThen the faces changed. I was killing Taren, the bearded ex-mercenary in my troupe. Then I killed Trip. Then I was chasing Shandi through the forest, my sword naked in my hand. She was crying out, weeping in fear. When I finally caught her she clutched at me, knocking me to the ground, burying her face in my chest, sobbing. \u201cNo no no,\u201d she begged. \u201cNo no no.\u201d\nI came awake. I lay on my back, terrified and not knowing where my dream ended and the world began. After a brief moment I realized the truth. Ell had crawled from the tent and lay curled against me. Her face pressed against my chest, her hand grasping desperately at my arm.\n\u201cNo no,\u201d she choked out. \u201cNo no no no no.\u201d Her body shook with helpless sobs when she couldn\u2019t say it anymore. My shirt was wet with hot tears. My arm was bleeding where she clutched it.\nI made consoling noises and brushed at her hair with my hand. After a long while she quieted and eventually fell into an exhausted sleep, still clinging tightly to my chest.\nI lay very still, not wanting to wake her by moving. My teeth were clenched. I thought of Alleg and Otto and all the rest. I remembered the blood and screaming and the smell of burning skin. I remembered it all and dreamed of worse things I could have done to them.\nI never had the nightmares again. Sometimes I think of Alleg and I smile.", " We made it to Levinshir the next day. Ell had come to her senses, but remained quiet and withdrawn. Still, things went more quickly now, especially as the girls decided they had recovered enough to take turns riding Greytail.\nWe covered six miles before we stopped at midday, with the girls becoming increasingly excited as they began to recognize parts of the countryside. The shape of hills in the distance. A crooked tree by the road.\nBut as we grew closer to Levinshir they grew quiet.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just over the rise there,\u201d Krin said, getting down off the roan. \u201cYou ride from here, Ell.\u201d\nEll looked from her, to me, to her feet. She shook her head.\nI watched them. \u201cAre the two of you okay?\u201d\n\u201cMy father\u2019s going to kill me.\u201d Krin\u2019s voice was barely a whisper, her face\nfull of serious fear.\n\u201cYour father will be one of the happiest men in the world tonight,\u201d I said,\nthen thought it best to be honest. \u201cHe might be angry too. But that\u2019s only because he\u2019s been scared out of his mind for the last eight days.\u201d\nKrin seemed slightly reassured, but Ell burst out crying. Krin put her arms around her, making gentle sounds.\n\u201cNo one will marry me,\u201d Ell sobbed. \u201cI was going to marry Jason Waterson and help him run his store. He won\u2019t marry me now. No one will.\u201d\nI looked up to Krin and saw the same fear reflected in her wet eyes. But Krin\u2019s eyes were angry while Ell\u2019s held nothing but despair.\n\u201cAny man who thinks that way is a fool,\u201d I said, weighting my voice with all the conviction I could bring to bear. \u201cAnd the two of you are too clever and too beautiful to be marrying fools.\u201d\nIt seemed to calm Ell somewhat, her eyes turning up at me as if looking for something to believe.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the truth,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd none of this was your fault. Make sure you remember that for these next couple days.\u201d\n\u201cI hate them!\u201d Ell spat, surprising me with her sudden rage. \u201cI hate men!\u201d Her knuckles were white as she gripped Greytail\u2019s reins. Her face twisted into a mask of anger. Krin put her arms around Ell, but when she looked at me I saw the sentiment reflected quietly in her dark eyes.\n\u201cYou have every right to hate them,\u201d I said, feeling more anger and", "helplessness than ever before in my life. \u201cBut I\u2019m a man too. Not all of us are like that.\u201d\nWe stayed there for a while, not more than a half-mile from town. We had a drink of water and a small bite to settle our nerves. And then I took them home.", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-FIVE\nHomecoming\nLEVINSHIR WASN\u2019T A BIG town. Two hundred people lived there, maybe three if you counted the outlying farms. It was mealtime when we rode in, and the dirt road that split the town in half was empty and quiet. Ell told me her house was on the far side of town. I hoped to get the girls there without being seen. They were worn down and distraught. The last thing they needed was to face a mob of gossipy neighbors.\nBut it wasn\u2019t meant to be. We were halfway through the town when I saw a flicker of movement in a window. A woman\u2019s voice cried out, \u201cEll!\u201d and in ten seconds people began to spill from every doorway in sight.\nThe women were the quickest, and inside a minute a dozen of them had formed a protective knot around the two girls, talking and crying and hugging each other. The girls didn\u2019t seem to mind. Perhaps it was better this way. A warm welcome might do a lot to heal them.\nThe men held back, knowing they were useless in situations like this. Most watched from doorways or porches. Six or eight came down onto the street, moving slowly and eyeing up the situation. These were cautious men, farmers and friends of farmers.They knew the names of everyone within ten miles of their homes. There were no strangers in a town like Levinshir, except for me.\nNone of the men were close relatives to the girls. Even if they were, they knew they wouldn\u2019t get near them for at least an hour, maybe as much as a day. So they let their wives and sisters take care of things. With nothing else to occupy them, their attention wandered briefly past the horses and settled onto me.\nI motioned over a boy of ten or so. \u201cGo tell the mayor his daughter\u2019s back. Run!\u201d He tore off in a cloud of road dust, his bare feet flying.\nThe men moved slowly closer to me, their natural suspicion of strangers made ten times worse by recent events. A boy of twelve or so wasn\u2019t as cautious as the rest and came right up to me, eyeing my sword, my cloak.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I asked him.", "\u201cPete.\u201d\n\u201cCan you ride a horse, Pete?\u201d\nHe looked insulted. \u201cS\u2019nuf.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know where the Walker farm is?\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201c \u2019Bout north two miles by the millway.\u201d\nI stepped sideways and handed him the reins to the roan. \u201cGo tell them\ntheir daughter\u2019s home. Then let them use the horse to come back to town.\u201d He had a leg over the horse before I could offer him a hand up. I kept a\nhand on the reins long enough to shorten the stirrups so he wouldn\u2019t kill himself on the way there.\n\u201cIf you make it there and back without breaking your head or my horse\u2019s leg, I\u2019ll give you a penny,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll give me two,\u201d he said.\nI laughed. He wheeled the horse around and was gone.\nThe men had wandered closer in the meantime, gathering around me in a\nloose circle.\nA tall, balding fellow with a scowl and a grizzled beard seemed to appoint\nhimself leader. \u201cSo who\u2019re you?\u201d he asked, his tone speaking more clearly than his words, Who the hell are you?\n\u201cKvothe,\u201d I answered pleasantly. \u201cAnd yourself?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t know as that\u2019s any of your business,\u201d he growled. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d What the hell are you doing here with our two girls?\n\u201cGod\u2019s mother, Seth,\u201d an older man said to him. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the sense God gave a dog. That\u2019s no way to talk to the . . .\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t give me any of your lip, Benjamin,\u201d the scowling man bristled back. \u201cWe got a good right to know who he is.\u201d He turned to me and took a few steps in front of everyone else. \u201cYou one of those trouper bastards what came through here?\u201d\nI shook my head and attempted to look harmless. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cI think you are. I think you look kinda like one of them Ruh. You got them eyes.\u201d The men around him craned to get a better look at my face.\n\u201cGod, Seth,\u201d the old fellow chimed in again. \u201cNone of them had red hair. You remember hair like that. He ain\u2019t one of \u2019em.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would I bring them back if I\u2019d been one of the men who took them?\u201d I pointed out.\nHis expression grew darker and he continued his slow advance. \u201cYou gettin\u2019 smart with me, boy? Maybe you think all of us are stupid here? You", "think if you bring \u2019em back you\u2019ll get a reward or maybe we won\u2019t send anyone else out after you?\u201d He was almost within arm\u2019s reach of me now, scowling furiously.\nI looked around and saw the same anger lurking in the faces of all the men who stood there. It was the sort of anger that comes to a slow boil inside the hearts of good men who want justice, and finding it out of their grasp, decide vengeance is the next best thing.\nI tried to think of a way to calm the situation, but before I could do anything I heard Krin\u2019s voice lash out from behind me. \u201cSeth, you get away from him!\u201d\nSeth paused, his hands half raised against me. \u201cNow ...\u201d\nKrin was already stepping toward him. The knot of women loosened to release her, but stayed close. \u201cHe saved us, Seth,\u201d she shouted furiously. \u201cYou stupid shit-eater, he saved us. Where the hell were all of you? Why didn\u2019t you come get us?\u201d\nHe backed away from me as anger and shame fought their way across his face. Anger won. \u201cWe came,\u201d he shouted back. \u201cAfter we found out what happened we went after \u2019em. They shot out Bil\u2019s horse from under him, and he got his leg crushed. Jim got his arm stabbed, and old Cupper still ain\u2019t waked up from the thumping they give him. They almost killed us.\u201d\nI looked again and saw anger on the men\u2019s faces. Saw the real reason for it. The helplessness they had felt, unable to defend their town from the false troupe\u2019s rough handling. Their failure to reclaim the daughters of their friends and neighbors had shamed them.\n\u201cWell it wasn\u2019t good enough!\u201d Krin shouted back hotly, her eyes burning. \u201cHe came and got us because he\u2019s a real man. Not like the rest of you who left us to die!\u201d\nThe anger leapt out of a young man to my left, a farm boy, about seventeen. \u201cNone of this would have happened if you hadn\u2019t been running around like some Ruh whore!\u201d\nI broke his arm before I quite realized what I was doing. He screamed as he fell to the ground.\nI pulled him to his feet by the scruff of his neck. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I snarled into his face.\n\u201cMy arm!\u201d He gasped, his eyes showing me their whites. I shook him like a rag doll. \u201cName!\u201d\n\u201cJason,\u201d he blurted. \u201cGod\u2019s mother, my arm . . .\u201d", "I took his chin in my free hand and turned his face toward Krin and Ell. \u201cJason,\u201d I hissed quietly in his ear. \u201cI want you to look at those girls. And I want you to think about the hell they\u2019ve been through in these past days, tied hand and foot in the back of a wagon. And I want you to ask yourself what\u2019s worse. A broken arm, or getting kidnapped by a stranger and raped four times a night?\u201d\nThen I turned his face toward me and spoke so quiet that even an inch away it was hardly a whisper. \u201cAfter you\u2019ve thought of that, I want you to pray to God to forgive you for what you just said. And if you mean it, Tehlu grant your arm heal straight and true.\u201d His eyes were terrified and wet. \u201cAfter that, if you ever think an unkind thought about either of them, your arm will ache like there\u2019s hot iron in the bone. And if you ever say an unkind word, it will go to fever and slow rot and they\u2019ll have to cut it off to save your life.\u201d I tightened my grip on him, watching his eyes widen. \u201cAnd if you ever do anything to either of them, I\u2019ll know. I will come here, and kill you, and leave your body hanging in a tree.\u201d\nThere were tears on his face now, although whether from shame or fear or pain I couldn\u2019t guess. \u201cNow you tell her you\u2019re sorry for what you said.\u201d I let go of him after making sure he had his feet under him and pointed him in the direction of Krin and Ell. The women stood around them like a protective cocoon.\nHe clutched his arm weakly. \u201cI shouldn\u2019ta said that, Ellie,\u201d he sobbed, sounding more wretched and repentant than I would have thought possible, broken arm or no. \u201cIt was a demon talkin\u2019 out of me. I swear though, I been sick worryin\u2019. We all been. And we did try to come get you, but they was a lot of them and they jumped us on the road, then we had to bring Bil home or he would\u2019ve died from his leg.\u201d\nSomething tickled my memory about the boy\u2019s name. Jason? I suddenly suspected I had just broken Ell\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s arm. Somehow I couldn\u2019t feel bad for it just now. Best thing for him, really.\nLooking around I saw the anger bleed out of the faces of the men around me, as if I\u2019d used up the whole town\u2019s supply in a sudden, furious flash. Instead they watched Jason, looking slightly embarrassed, as if the boy were apologizing for the lot of them.\nThen I saw a big, healthy-looking man running down the street followed by a dozen other townsfolk. From the look on his face I guessed it was Ell\u2019s father, the mayor. He forced his way into the knot of women, gathered his", "daughter up in his arms, and swung her around.\nYou find two types of mayor in small towns like this. The first type are\nbalding, older men of considerable girth who are good with money and tend to wring their hands a great deal when anything unexpected happens. The second type are tall, broad-shouldered men whose families have grown slowly prosperous because they had worked like angry bastards behind a plow for twenty generations. Ell\u2019s father was the second sort.\nHe walked over to me, keeping one arm around his daughter\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI understand I have you to thank for bringing our girls back.\u201d He reached out to shake my hand and I saw his arm was bandaged. His grip was solid in spite of it. He smiled the widest smile I\u2019d seen since I left Simmon at the University.\n\u201cHow\u2019s the arm?\u201d I asked, not realizing how it would sound. His smile faded a little, and I was quick to add, \u201cI\u2019ve had some training as a physicker. And I know that those sort of things can be tricky to deal with when you\u2019re away from home.\u201d When you\u2019re living in a country that thinks mercury is medicine, I thought to myself.\nHis smile came back, and he flexed his fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s stiff, but that\u2019s all. Just a little meat. They caught us by surprise. I got my hands on one of them, but he stuck me and got away. How did you end up getting the girls away from those godless Ruh bastards?\u201d He spat.\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t Edema Ruh,\u201d I said, my voice sounding more strained than I would have liked. \u201cThey weren\u2019t even real troupers.\u201d\nHis smile began to fade again. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t Edema Ruh. We don\u2019t do the things they did.\u201d\n\u201cListen,\u201d the mayor said plainly, his temper starting to rise a bit. \u201cI know\ndamn well what they do and don\u2019t do. They came in all sweet and nice, played a little music, made a penny or two. Then they started to make trouble around town. When we told them to leave they took my girl.\u201d He almost breathed fire as he said the last words.\n\u201cWe?\u201d I heard someone say faintly behind me. \u201cJim, he said we.\u201d\nSeth scowled around the side of the mayor to get a look at me again. \u201cI told you he looked like one,\u201d he said triumphantly. \u201cI know \u2019em. You can always tell by them eyes.\u201d\n\u201cHold on,\u201d the mayor said with slow incredulity. \u201cAre you telling me you\u2019re one of them?\u201d His expression grew dangerous.\nBefore I could explain myself. Ell had grabbed his arm. \u201cOh, don\u2019t make", "him mad, Daddy,\u201d she said quickly, holding onto his good arm as if to pull him away from me. \u201cDon\u2019t say anything to get him angry. He\u2019s not with them. He brought me back, he saved me.\u201d\nThe mayor seemed somewhat mollified by this, but his congeniality was gone. \u201cExplain yourself,\u201d he said grimly.\nI sighed inside, realizing what a mess I\u2019d made of this. \u201cThey weren\u2019t troupers, and they certainly weren\u2019t Edema Ruh. They were bandits who killed some of my family and stole their wagons. They were only pretending to be performers.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would anyone pretend to be Ruh?\u201d the mayor asked, as if the thought were incomprehensible.\n\u201cSo they could do what they did,\u201d I snapped. \u201cYou let them into your town and they abused that trust. That\u2019s something no Edema Ruh would ever do.\u201d\n\u201cYou never did answer my question,\u201d he said. \u201cHow did you get the girls away?\u201d\n\u201cI took care of things,\u201d I said simply.\n\u201cHe killed them,\u201d Krin said loudly enough for everyone to hear. \u201cHe killed them all.\u201d\nI could feel everyone looking at me. Half of them were thinking, All of them? He killed seven men? The other half were thinking, There were two women with them, did he kill them too?\n\u201cWell, then.\u201d The mayor looked down at me for a long moment. \u201cGood,\u201d he said as if he had just made up his mind. \u201cThat\u2019s good. The world\u2019s a better place for it.\u201d\nI felt everyone relax slightly. \u201cThese are their horses.\u201d I pointed to the two horses that had been carrying our baggage. \u201cThey belong to the girls now. About forty miles east you\u2019ll find the wagons. Krin can show you where they\u2019re hidden. They belong to the girls too.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ll fetch a good price off in Temsford,\u201d the mayor mused.\n\u201cTogether with the instruments and clothes and such, they\u2019ll fetch a heavy penny,\u201d I agreed. \u201cSplit two ways, it\u2019ll make a fine dowry,\u201d I said firmly.\nHe met my eyes, nodded slowly in understanding. \u201cThat it will.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the things they stole from us?\u201d a stout man in an apron protested. \u201cThey smashed up my place and stole two barrels of my best ale!\u201d\n\u201cDo you have any daughters?\u201d I asked him calmly. The sudden, stricken look on his face told me he did. I met his eye, held it. \u201cThen I think you came away from this pretty well.\u201d", "The mayor finally noticed Jason clutching his broken arm. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d\nJason looked at his feet, and Seth spoke up for him, \u201cHe said some things he shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\nThe mayor looked around and saw that getting more of an answer would involve an ordeal. He shrugged and let it go.\n\u201cI could splint it for you,\u201d I said easily.\n\u201cNo!\u201d Jason said too quickly, then backpedaled. \u201cI\u2019d rather go to Gran.\u201d\nI gave a sideways look to the mayor. \u201cGran?\u201d\nHe gave a fond smile. \u201cWhen we scrape our knees Gran patches us back up\nagain.\u201d\n\u201cWould Bil be there?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe man with the crushed leg?\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cShe won\u2019t let him out of her sight for another span of days if I\nknow her.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll walk you over,\u201d I said to the sweating boy who was carefully cradling\nhis arm. \u201cI\u2019d like to watch her work.\u201d\nAs far from civilization as we were, I expected Gran to be a hunched old woman who treated her patients with leeches and wood alcohol.\nThat opinion changed when I saw the inside of her house. Her walls were covered with bundles of dry herbs and shelves lined with small, carefully labeled bottles. There was a small desk with three heavy leather books on it. One of them lay open, and I recognized it as The Heroborica. I could see handwritten notes scrawled in the margins, while some of the entries had been edited or crossed out entirely.\nGran wasn\u2019t as old as I\u2019d thought she\u2019d be, though she did have her share of grey hair. She wasn\u2019t hunched either, and actually stood taller than me, with broad shoulders and a round, smiling face.\nShe swung a copper kettle over the fire, humming to herself. Then she brought out a pair of shears and sat Jason down, prodding his arm gently. Pale and sweating, the boy kept up a constant stream of nervous chatter while she methodically cut his shirt away. In the space of a few minutes, without her even asking, he\u2019d given her an accurate if somewhat disjointed version of Ell and Krin\u2019s homecoming.\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a nice clean break,\u201d she said at last, interrupting him. \u201cHow\u2019d it happen?\u201d\nJason\u2019s wild eyes darted to me, then away. \u201cNothin\u2019,\u201d he said quickly. Then realized he hadn\u2019t answered the question. \u201cI mean ...\u201d\n\u201cI broke it,\u201d I said. \u201cFigured the least I could do was come along and see if there\u2019s anything I could do to help set it right again.\u201d\nGran looked back at me. \u201cHave you dealt with this sort of thing before?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve studied medicine at the University,\u201d I said.\nShe shrugged. \u201cThen I guess you can hold the splints while I wrap \u2019em. I\nhave a girl who helps me, but she run off when she heard the commotion up the street.\u201d\nJason eyed me nervously as I held the wood tight to his arm, but it took Gran less than three minutes to bind up the splint with an air of bored competence. Watching her work, I decided she was worth more than half the students I could name in the Medica.\nAfter we\u2019d finished she looked down at Jason. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky,\u201d she said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t need to be set. You hold off using it for a month, it should heal up just fine.\u201d\nJason left as quickly as he was able, and after a small amount of persuasion Gran let me see Bil, who was laid up in her back room.\nIf Jason\u2019s arm was a clean break, then Bil\u2019s was messy as a break can be. Both the bones in his lower leg had broken in several places. I couldn\u2019t see under the bandages, but his leg was hugely swollen. The skin above the bandages was bruised and mottled, stretched as tight as an overstuffed sausage.\nBil was pale but alert, and it looked like he would probably keep the leg. How much use it would be was another matter. He might come away with nothing more than a heavy limp, but I wouldn\u2019t bet on him ever running again.\n\u201cWhat sort of folk shoot a man\u2019s horse?\u201d he asked indignantly, his face covered in a sheen of sweat. \u201cIt ain\u2019t right.\u201d\nIt had been his own horse, of course. And this wasn\u2019t the sort of town where folk had horses to spare. Bil was a young man with a new wife and his own small farm, and he might never walk again because he\u2019d tried to do the right thing. It hurt to think about.\nGran gave him two spoonfuls of something from a brown bottle, and it dragged his eyes shut. She ushered us out of the room and closed the door", "behind her.\n\u201cDid the bone break the skin?\u201d I asked once the door was closed.\nShe nodded as she put the bottle back on the shelf.\n\u201cWhat have you been using to keep it from going septic?\u201d\n\u201cSour, you mean?\u201d she asked. \u201cRamsburr.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d I asked. \u201cNot arrowroot?\u201d\n\u201cArrowroot,\u201d she snorted as she added wood to the fire and swung the\nnow-steaming kettle off of it. \u201cYou ever tried to keep something from going sour with arrowroot?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I admitted.\n\u201cLet me save you the trouble of killing someone, then.\u201d She brought out a pair of wooden cups. \u201cArrowroot is useless. You can eat it if you like, but that\u2019s about it.\u201d\n\u201cBut a paste of arrowroot and bessamy is supposed to be ideal for this.\u201d\n\u201cBessamy might be worth half a damn,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut ramsburr is better. I\u2019d rather have some redblade, but we can\u2019t always have what we want. A paste of motherleaf and ramsburr is what I use, and you can see he\u2019s doing just fine. Arrowroot is easy for folk to find, and it pulps smooth, but it hain\u2019t got any worthwhile properties.\u201d\nShe shook her head. \u201cArrowroot and camphor. Arrowroot and bessamy. Arrowroot and saltbine. Arrowroot hain\u2019t a palliative of any sort. It\u2019s just good at carrying around what works.\u201d\nI opened my mouth to protest, then looked around her house, at her heavily annotated copy of The Heroborica. I closed my mouth.\nGran poured hot water from the kettle into two cups. \u201cSit yourself down for a bit,\u201d she said. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re on your last leg.\u201d\nI looked longingly at the chair. \u201cI should probably be getting back,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got time for a cup,\u201d she said, taking my arm and setting me firmly into the chair. \u201cAnd a quick bite. You\u2019re pale as a dry bone, and I have a bit of sweet pudding here that hain\u2019t got anybody to give it a home.\u201d\nI tried to remember if I\u2019d eaten any lunch today. I remembered feeding the girls.... \u201cI don\u2019t want to put you to any more trouble,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve already made more work for you.\u201d\n\u201cAbout time somebody broke that boy\u2019s arm,\u201d she said conversationally. \u201cHas a mouth on him like you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d She handed me one of the wooden cups. \u201cDrink that down and I\u2019ll get you some of that pudding.\u201d\nThe steam coming off the cup smelled wonderful. \u201cWhat\u2019s in it?\u201d I asked.", "\u201cRosehip. And some apple brandy I still up my own self.\u201d She gave a wide smile that crinkled the edges of her eyes. \u201cIf you like, I can put in some arrowroot, too.\u201d\nI smiled and sipped. The warmth of it spread through my chest, and I felt myself relax a bit. Which was odd, as I hadn\u2019t realized I\u2019d been tense before.\nGran bustled about a bit before setting two plates on the table and easing herself down into a nearby chair.\n\u201cYou really kill those folk?\u201d she asked plainly. There wasn\u2019t any accusation in her voice. It was just a question.\nI nodded.\n\u201cYou probably shouldn\u2019t have told anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s bound to be a fuss. They\u2019ll want a trial and have to bring in the azzie from Temsford.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t tell them,\u201d I said. \u201cKrin did.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d she said.\nThe conversation lulled. I drank the last swallow out of my cup, but when I\ntried to set it on the table my hands were shaking so badly that it knocked against the wood, making a sound like an impatient visitor at the door.\nGran sipped calmly from her cup.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care to talk about it,\u201d I said at last. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a good thing.\u201d \u201cSome folk might argue that,\u201d she said gently. \u201cI think you done the right\nthing.\u201d\nHer words brought a sudden hot ache behind my eyes, as if I were about to\nburst into tears. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure about that,\u201d I said, my voice sounding strange in my own ears. My hands were shaking worse now.\nGran didn\u2019t seem surprised by this. \u201cYou\u2019ve had the bit in your teeth for a couple days now, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Her tone made it clear it wasn\u2019t really a question. \u201cI know the look.You\u2019ve been keeping busy. Looking after the girls. Not sleeping. Probably not eating much.\u201d She picked up the plate. \u201cEat your pudding. It will help to get some food in you.\u201d\nI ate the pudding. Halfway through, I began to cry, choking a bit as it stuck in my throat.\nGran refilled my cup with more tea and poured another dollop of brandy in on top of it. \u201cDrink that down,\u201d she repeated.\nI took a swallow. I didn\u2019t mean to say anything, but I found myself talking anyway. \u201cI think there might be something wrong with me,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cA normal person doesn\u2019t have it in him to do the things I do. A normal person would never kill people like this.\u201d", "\u201cThat may be,\u201d she admitted, sipping from her own cup. \u201cBut what would you say if I told you Bil\u2019s leg had gone a bit green and sweet smelling under that bandage?\u201d\nI looked up, startled. \u201cHe\u2019s got the rot?\u201d\nShe shook her head. \u201cNo. I told you he\u2019s fine. But what if?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019d have to cut the leg off,\u201d I said.\nGran nodded seriously. \u201cThat\u2019s right. And we\u2019d have to do it quick. Today.\nNo dithering about and hoping he\u2019d fight his way through on his own. That wouldn\u2019t do a thing but kill him.\u201d She took a sip, watching me over the top of her cup, making it a question of sorts.\nI nodded. I knew it was true.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got some medicine,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know that proper doctoring means hard choices.\u201d She gave me an unflinching look. \u201cWe hain\u2019t like other folk. You burn a man with an iron to stop his bleeding. You save the mother and lose the babe. It\u2019s hard, and nobody ever thanks you for it. But we\u2019re the ones that have to choose.\u201d\nShe took another slow drink of tea. \u201cThe first few times are the worst. You\u2019ll get the shakes and lose some sleep. But that\u2019s the price of doing what needs to be done.\u201d\n\u201cThere were women too,\u201d I said, the words catching in my throat.\nGran\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cThey earned it twice as much,\u201d she said, and the sudden, furious anger in her sweet face caught me so completely by surprise that I felt prickling fear crawl over my body. \u201cA man who would do that to a girl is like a mad dog. He hain\u2019t hardly a person, just an animal needs to be put down. But a woman who helps him do it? That\u2019s worse. She knows what she\u2019s doing. She knows what it means.\u201d\nGran put her cup down gently on the table, her expression composed again. \u201cIf a leg goes bad, you cut it off.\u201d She made a firm gesture with the flat of her hand, then picked up her slice of pudding and began to eat it with her fingers. \u201cAnd some folk need killing. That\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d\nBy the time I got myself under control and made it back outside, the crowd in the street had swelled. The local tavern keeper had rolled a barrel onto his front landing and the air was sweet with the smell of beer.\n \nKrin\u2019s father and mother had ridden back into town on the roan. Pete was there too, having run back. He offered up his unbroken head for my inspection and demanded his two pennies for services rendered.\nI was warmly thanked by Krin\u2019s parents. They seemed to be good people. Most people are if given the chance. I caught hold of the roan\u2019s reins, and using him as a sort of portable wall I managed to get a moment of relatively private conversation with Krin.\nHer dark eyes were a little red around the edges, but her face was bright and happy. \u201cMake sure you get Lady Ghost,\u201d I said, nodding to one of the horses. \u201cShe\u2019s yours.\u201d The mayor\u2019s daughter would have a fair dowry no matter what, so I\u2019d loaded Krin\u2019s horse with the more valuable goods, as well as most of the false troupers\u2019 money.\nHer expression grew serious as she met my eyes, and again she reminded me of a young Denna. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving,\u201d she said.\nI guess I was. She didn\u2019t try to convince me to stay, and instead surprised me with a sudden embrace. After kissing me on the cheek she whispered in my ear, \u201cThank you.\u201d\nWe stepped away from each other, knowing propriety would only allow so much. \u201cDon\u2019t sell yourself short and marry some fool,\u201d I said, feeling as if I should say something.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you either,\u201d she said, her dark eyes mocking me gently.\nI took Greytail\u2019s reins and led her over to where the mayor stood, watching the crowd in a proprietary way. He nodded as I approached.\nI drew a deep breath. \u201cIs the constable about?\u201d\nHe raised an eyebrow at this, then shrugged and pointed off into the crowd. \u201cThat\u2019s him there. He was three-quarters drunk even before you brought our girls home, though. Don\u2019t know how much use he\u2019ll be to you now.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said hesitantly. \u201cI\u2019m guessing someone is going to need to lock me up until you can get word to the azzie off in Temsford.\u201d I nodded to the small stone building in the center of town.\nThe mayor looked sideways at me, frowning a bit. \u201cYou want to be locked up?\u201d\n\u201cNot particularly,\u201d I admitted.\n\u201cYou can come and go as you please then,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe azzie won\u2019t be happy when he hears,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019d rather not have\nanyone else go up against the iron law because of something I\u2019ve done. Aiding in the escape of a murderer can be a hanging offense.\u201d", "The big man gave me a long looking over. His eyes lingered a bit on my sword, the worn leather of my boots. I could almost feel him noticing the lack of any serious wounds despite the fact that I\u2019d just killed half a dozen armed men.\n\u201cSo you\u2019d let us just lock you up?\u201d he asked. \u201cEasy as that?\u201d\nI shrugged.\nHe frowned again, then shook his head as if he couldn\u2019t make sense of me.\n\u201cWell aren\u2019t you just as gentle as a lamb?\u201d he said wonderingly. \u201cBut no. I won\u2019t lock you up. You haven\u2019t done anything less than proper.\u201d\n\u201cI broke that boy\u2019s arm,\u201d I said.\n\u201cHmm,\u201d he rumbled darkly. \u201cForgot about that.\u201d He reached into his pocket and brought out ha\u2019penny. He handed it to me. \u201cMuch obliged.\u201d\nI laughed as I put it in my pocket.\n\u201cHere\u2019s my thought,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll head over and see if I can find the constable. Then I\u2019ll explain to him we\u2019ve got to lock you up. If you\u2019ve slipped off in the middle of this confusion, we wouldn\u2019t hardly be aiding in the escape, would we?\u201d\n\u201cIt would be negligence in maintenance of the law,\u201d I said. \u201cHe might take a few lashes for it, or lose his post.\u201d\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t come to that,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cBut if it does, he\u2019ll be happy to do it. He\u2019s Ellie\u2019s uncle.\u201d He looked out at the crowd on the street. \u201cWill fifteen minutes be enough for you to slip off in all the confusion?\u201d\n\u201cIf it\u2019s all the same to you,\u201d I said. \u201cCould you say I disappeared in a strange and mysterious way when your back was turned?\u201d\nHe laughed at this. \u201cDon\u2019t see why not. You need more than fifteen minutes on account of it being mysterious and all?\u201d\n\u201cTen should be a great plenty,\u201d I said as I unpacked my lute case and travelsack from Greytail and handed the mayor the reins. \u201cYou\u2019d be doing me a favor if you took care of him until Bil is up and about,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou leaving your horse?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cHe\u2019s just lost his.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cAnd we Ruh are used to walking. I wouldn\u2019t know what to do with a horse, anyway,\u201d I said half-honestly.\nThe big man gripped the reins and gave me a long look, as if he wasn\u2019t quite sure what to make of me. \u201cIs there anything we can do for you?\u201d he asked at last.\n\u201cRemember it was bandits who took them,\u201d I said as I turned to leave. \u201cAnd remember it was one of the Edema Ruh who brought them back.\u201d", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-SIX\nInterlude\u2014Close to Forgetting\nKVOTHE HELD UP A hand to Chronicler. \u201cLet\u2019s take a moment, shall we?\u201d He looked around the dark inn. \u201cI\u2019ve let myself get a little caught up in the story. I should tend to a few things before it gets any later.\u201d\nThe innkeeper came stiffly to his feet and stretched. He lit a candle at the fireplace and moved around the inn, lighting the lamps one by one, driving back the dark by slow degrees.\n\u201cI was focused rather closely myself,\u201d Chronicler said, standing up and stretching. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d\n\u201cLate,\u201d Bast said. \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d\nChronicler looked out the dark window into the street. \u201cI\u2019d have thought you\u2019d have had at least a few folks in for dinner by now.You pulled a good crowd for lunch.\u201d\nKvothe nodded. \u201cWe would\u2019ve seen a few of my regulars if not for Shep\u2019s funeral.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d Chronicler looked down. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten. Is that something I\u2019ve kept you two from attending?\u201d\nKvothe lit the last lamp behind the bar and blew out his candle. \u201cNot really,\u201d he said. \u201cBast and I aren\u2019t from around these parts. And they\u2019re practical folk. They know I have a business to run, such as it is.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t get along with Abbe Leodin,\u201d Bast said.\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t get along with the local priest,\u201d Kvothe admitted. \u201cBut you should make an appearance, Bast. It will seem odd if you don\u2019t.\u201d\nBast\u2019s eyes darted around nervously. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave, Reshi.\u201d\nKvothe smiled warmly at him. \u201cYou should, Bast. Shep was a good man, go have a drink to send him off. In fact . . .\u201d He bent and rummaged around under the bar for a moment before coming up with a bottle. \u201cHere. A fine old bottle of brand. Better stuff than anyone around here asks for. Go share it around.\u201d He set it on the bar with a solid sound.\nBast took an involuntary step forward, his face conflicted. \u201cBut Reshi, I . .", ".\u201d\n\u201cPretty girls dancing, Bast,\u201d Kvothe said, his voice low and soothing.\n\u201cSomeone on the fiddle and all of them just glad to be alive. Kicking up their skirts to the music. Laughing and a little tipsy. Their cheeks all rosy and ready to be kissed. . . .\u201d He gave the heavy brown bottle a nudge, and it slid down the bar toward his student. \u201cYou\u2019re my ambassador to the town. I may be stuck minding the shop, but you can be there and make my apologies.\u201d\nBast closed his hand around the neck of the bottle. \u201cI\u2019ll have one drink,\u201d he said, his voice thick with resolve. \u201cAnd one dance. And one kiss with Katie Miller. And maybe another with the Widow Creel. But that\u2019s all.\u201d He looked Kvothe in the eye. \u201cI\u2019ll only be gone half an hour. . . .\u201d\nKvothe gave a warm smile. \u201cI have things to tend to, Bast. I\u2019ll cobble together dinner and we\u2019ll give our friend\u2019s hand a bit of a rest.\u201d\nBast grinned and picked up the bottle. \u201cTwo dances then!\u201d He bolted for the door, and when he opened it the wind gusted around him, swirling his hair wildly. \u201cSave me something to eat!\u201d He shouted over his shoulder.\nThe door banged shut.\nChronicler gave the innkeeper a curious look.\nKvothe gave a small shrug. \u201cHe was getting too tangled up in the story. He\ncan\u2019t feel a thing halfway. A little time away will give him some perspective. Besides, I do have dinner to prepare, even if it\u2019s only for three.\u201d\nThe scribe brought a grimy piece of cloth out of his leather satchel and looked at it with some distaste. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose I could trouble you for a clean rag?\u201d he asked.\nKvothe nodded and brought out a white linen cloth from beneath the bar. \u201cIs there anything else you need?\u201d\nChronicler stood and walked over to the bar. \u201cIf you had some strong spirits it would be a great help,\u201d he said, sounding slightly embarrassed. \u201cI hate to ask, but when I was robbed . . .\u201d\nKvothe waved the comment away. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cI should have asked you yesterday if there was anything you needed.\u201d He moved out from behind the bar toward the basement stairs. \u201cI\u2019m assuming wood alcohol would work best?\u201d\nChronicler nodded, and Kvothe disappeared into the basement. The scribe picked up the crisply folded square of linen and rubbed it idly between his fingers. Then his eyes wandered up to the sword hanging high on the wall behind the bar. The grey metal of the blade was striking against the dark", "wood of the mounting board.\nKvothe came back up the steps carrying a small clear bottle. \u201cIs there\nanything else you need? I have a good stock of paper and ink here too.\u201d\n\u201cIt may come to that by tomorrow,\u201d Chronicler said. \u201cI\u2019ve used up most of\nmy paper. But I can grind more ink tonight.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t put yourself to the trouble,\u201d Kvothe said easily.\u201cI have several\nbottles of fine Aruean ink.\u201d\n\u201cTrue Aruean ink?\u201d Chronicler asked, surprised.\nKvothe gave a broad smile and nodded.\n\u201cThat\u2019s terribly kind of you,\u201d Chronicler said, relaxing a bit. \u201cI\u2019ll admit I\nwasn\u2019t looking forward to spending an hour grinding tonight.\u201d He gathered up the clear bottle and cloth, then paused. \u201cWould you mind if I asked you a question? Unofficially, as it were?\u201d\nA smirk curled the corner of Kvothe\u2019s mouth. \u201cVery well then, unofficially.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t help notice that your description of Caesura doesn\u2019t . . .\u201d Chronicler hesitated. \u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t quite seem to match the actual sword itself.\u201d His eyes flicked to the sword behind the bar. \u201cThe hand guard isn\u2019t what you described.\u201d\nKvothe gave a wide grin. \u201cWell you\u2019re just sharp as anything, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t mean to imply\u2014\u201d Chronicler said quickly, looking embarrassed. Kvothe laughed a rich warm laugh. The sound of it tumbled around the\nroom, and for a moment the inn didn\u2019t feel empty at all. \u201cNo. You\u2019re absolutely right.\u201d He turned to look at the sword. \u201cThis isn\u2019t . . . what did the boy call it this morning?\u201d His eyes went distant for a moment, then he smiled again. \u201cKaysera. The poet killer.\u201d\n\u201cI was just curious,\u201d Chronicler said apologetically.\n\u201cAm I supposed to be offended that you\u2019re paying attention?\u201d Kvothe laughed again. \u201cWhat fun is there in telling a story if nobody\u2019s listening?\u201d He rubbed his hands together eagerly. \u201cRight then. Dinner. What would you like? Hot or cold? Soup or stew? I\u2019m a dab hand at pudding too.\u201d\nThey settled on something simple to avoid restoking the stove in the kitchen. Kvothe moved briskly around the inn, gathering what was needed. He hummed to himself as he fetched cold mutton and half a hard, sharp cheese from the basement.\n\u201cThese will be a nice surprise for Bast.\u201d Kvothe grinned at Chronicler as he brought out a jar of brined olives from the pantry. \u201cHe can\u2019t know we", "have them or he\u2019d have eaten them already.\u201d He untied his apron, pulling it off over his head. \u201cI think we have a few tomatoes left in the garden too.\u201d\nKvothe returned after several minutes with his apron wrapped into a bundle. He was spattered with rain and his hair was in wild disarray. He wore a boyish grin, and at that moment he looked very little like the somber, slowmoving innkeeper.\n\u201cIt can\u2019t quite decide if it wants to storm,\u201d he said as he set his apron on the bar, carefully removing the tomatoes. \u201cBut if it makes up its mind, we\u2019re in for a wagon-tipper tonight.\u201d He began to hum absentmindedly while he cut and arranged everything on a broad wooden platter.\nThe door of the Waystone opened and a sudden gust of wind made the lamplight flicker. Two soldiers came in, hunched against the weather, their swords sticking out like tails behind them. Dark spatters of rain spotted the fabric of their blue and white tabards.\nThey dropped their heavy packs, and the shorter of the two pressed his shoulder to the door, forcing it closed against the wind.\n\u201cGod\u2019s teeth,\u201d said the taller one, straightening his clothes. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad night to be caught in the open.\u201d He was bald on top, with a thick black beard that was flat as a spade. He looked at Kvothe, \u201cHo boy!\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cWe were glad to see your light. Run and fetch the owner, would you? We need to have a word with him.\u201d\nKvothe picked his apron up off the bar and ducked his head into it. \u201cThat would be me,\u201d he said, clearing his throat as he tied the strings around his waist. He ran his hands through his tousled hair, smoothing it down.\nThe bearded soldier peered at him, then shrugged. \u201cFair enough. Any chance of us getting a spot of dinner?\u201d\nThe innkeeper gestured to the empty room. \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem worth putting the kettle on tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got what you see here.\u201d\nThe two soldiers strode to the bar. The blonde one ran his hands through his curly hair, shaking a few drops of rain out of it. \u201cThis town looks deader than ditchwater,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see a single light but this.\u201d\n\u201cLong harvest day,\u201d the innkeeper said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a wake tonight at one of the nearby farms. The four of us are probably the only folk in town right now.\u201d He rubbed his hands together briskly. \u201cCan I interest you fine folk in a drink to take off the chill?\u201d He brought out a bottle of wine and sat it on the bar with a solid, satisfying sound.\n\u201cWell that\u2019s a difficulty,\u201d the blonde soldier said with a bit of an", "embarrassed smile. \u201cI\u2019d dearly love a drink, but my friend and I just took the king\u2019s coin.\u201d He reached into his pocket and brought out a bright gold coin. \u201cThis is all the money I have on me. I don\u2019t suppose you have enough to break a whole royal, would you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m stuck with mine too,\u201d the bearded soldier groused. \u201cMost money I\u2019ve ever had, but it don\u2019t spend well in a lump. Most of the towns we\u2019ve been through could barely make change for ha\u2019penny.\u201d He chuckled at his own joke.\n\u201cI should be able to help you out with that,\u201d the innkeeper said easily. The two soldiers exchanged a look. The blonde one nodded.\n\u201cRight then.\u201d The blonde soldier put the coin back in his pocket. \u201cHere\u2019s\nthe truth. We aren\u2019t really going to be stopping for the night.\u201d He picked up a piece of cheese off the bar and took a bite. \u201cAnd we aren\u2019t going to be paying for anything either.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d the innkeeper said. \u201cI see.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if you\u2019ve got enough money in your purse to change out two gold royals,\u201d the bearded one said eagerly, \u201cthen we\u2019ll have that off you as well.\u201d The blonde soldier spread his hands in a calming gesture. \u201cNow this don\u2019t\nneed to be any sort of ugly thing. We aren\u2019t bad folk. You pass over your purse and we go on our way. No folk get hurt, and nothing gets wrecked. It\u2019s bound to sting a bit.\u201d He raised an eyebrow at the innkeeper. \u201cBut a little sting beats hell out of getting yourself killed. Am I right?\u201d\nThe bearded soldier looked over at where Chronicler sat near the hearth. \u201cThis hain\u2019t got nothing to do with you, either,\u201d he said grimly, his beard waggling as he spoke. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anything of yours. You just stay sat where you\u2019re at and don\u2019t get feisty on us.\u201d\nChronicler shot a glance to the man behind the bar, but the innkeeper\u2019s eyes were fixed on the two soldiers.\nThe blonde one took another bite of cheese while his eyes wandered around the inn. \u201cYoung man like you is doing pretty well for himself. You\u2019ll be doing just as well after we\u2019re gone. But if you start trouble, we\u2019ll feed you your teeth, wreck up the place, and you\u2019ll still be out your purse.\u201d He dropped the rest of the cheese on the bar and clapped his hands together briskly. He smiled. \u201cSo, are we all going to be civilized folk?\u201d\n\u201cThat seems reasonable,\u201d Kvothe said as he walked out from behind the bar. He moved slowly and carefully, the way you would approach a skittish horse. \u201cI\u2019m certainly no barbarian.\u201d Kvothe reached down and removed his", "purse from his pocket. He held it out in one hand.\nThe blonde soldier walked over to him, swaggering just a bit. He took hold\nof the purse and hefted it appreciatively. He turned to smile at his friend. \u201cYou see, I told\u2014\u201d\nIn a smooth motion, Kvothe stepped forward and struck the man hard in the jaw. The soldier staggered and fell to one knee. The purse arced through the air and hit the floorboards with a solid metallic thud.\nBefore the soldier could do more than shake his head, Kvothe stepped forward and calmly kicked him in the shoulder. Not a sharp kick of the sort that breaks bones, but a hard kick that sent him sprawling backward. The man landed hard on the floor, rolling to a stop in a messy tangle of arms and legs.\nThe other soldier stepped past his friend, grinning wide under his beard. He was taller than Kvothe, and his fists were broad knots of scar and knuckle. \u201cRight cully,\u201d he said, dark satisfaction in his voice. \u201cYou\u2019re gettin\u2019 a kickin\u2019 now.\u201d\nHe snapped out a quick punch, but Kvothe stepped aside and kicked out sharply, hitting the soldier just above the knee. The bearded man grunted in surprise, stumbling slightly. Then Kvothe stepped close, caught the bearded man\u2019s shoulder, gripped his wrist, and twisted his outstretched arm at an awkward angle.\nThe big man was forced to bend over, grimacing in pain. Then he jerked his arm roughly out of the innkeeper\u2019s grip. Kvothe had half a moment to look startled before the soldier\u2019s elbow caught him in the temple.\nThe innkeeper staggered backward, trying to gain a little distance and a moment to clear his head. But the soldier followed close after him, fists raised, waiting for an opening.\nBefore Kvothe could regain his balance, the soldier stepped close and drove a fist hard into his gut. The innkeeper let out a pained huff of air, and as he started to double over the soldier swung his other fist into the side of the innkeeper\u2019s face, snapping Kvothe\u2019s head to the side and sending him reeling.\nKvothe managed to keep his feet by grabbing a nearby table for support. Blinking, he threw a wild punch to keep the bearded man at a distance. But the solider merely brushed it aside and caught hold of the innkeeper\u2019s wrist in one huge hand, easy as a father might grab hold of a wayward child in the street.\nBlood running down the side of his face, Kvothe struggled to free his wrist.", "Dazed, he made a quick motion with both hands, then repeated it, trying to pull away. His eyes half-focused and dull with confusion, he looked down at his wrist and made the motion again, but his hands merely scrabbled uselessly at the soldier\u2019s scarred fist.\nThe bearded soldier eyed the stupefied innkeeper with amused curiosity, then reached out and slapped him hard on the side of the head. \u201cYou\u2019re almost a bit of a scrapper, boy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou actually stuck one on me.\u201d\nBehind them, the blonde soldier was slowly getting to his feet. \u201cLittle bastard sucker-punched me.\u201d\nThe big soldier yanked the innkeeper\u2019s wrist so he stumbled forward. \u201cSay you\u2019re sorry, cully.\u201d\nThe innkeeper blinked blearily, opened his mouth as if he were about to speak, then staggered. Or rather, he seemed to stagger. Halfway through the stumbling motion became deliberate, and the innkeeper stomped down hard with the heel of his foot, aiming at the soldier\u2019s boot. At the same time he snapped his forehead down at the bearded man\u2019s nose.\nBut the big man merely laughed, moving his head to the side as he jerked the innkeeper off balance again by his wrist. \u201cNone of that,\u201d he chided, backhanding Kvothe across the face.\nThe innkeeper let out a yelp and lifted a hand to his bleeding nose. The soldier grinned and casually drove a knee hard into the innkeeper\u2019s groin.\nKvothe doubled over, first gasping soundlessly, then making a series of choked retching noises.\nMoving casually, the soldier let go of Kvothe\u2019s wrist, then reached out and picked up the bottle of wine from the bar. Gripping it by the neck, he swung it like a club. When it hit the side of the innkeeper\u2019s head, it made a solid, almost metallic sound.\nKvothe crumpled bonelessly to the floor.\nThe big man looked at the bottle of wine curiously before setting it back on the bar. Then he bent, grabbed the innkeeper\u2019s shirt, and dragged his limp body out onto the open floor. He nudged the unconscious body with a foot until it stirred sluggishly.\n\u201cSaid I\u2019d give you a kickin\u2019, boy,\u201d the soldier grunted, and drove his foot hard into Kvothe\u2019s side.\nThe blonde soldier walked over, rubbing at the side of his face. \u201cHad to get all clever, didn\u2019t you?\u201d he said, spitting on the floor. He drew back his boot and landed a hard kick of his own. The innkeeper drew a sharp, hissing", "breath, but made no other sound.\n\u201cAnd you . . .\u201d The bearded soldier pointed a thick finger at Chronicler.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got more than one boot. Would you like to see the other? I\u2019ve already skint my knuckles. It\u2019s no bother to me if you want to lose a couple teeth.\u201d\nChronicler looked around and seemed genuinely surprised to find himself standing. He lowered himself slowly back into his chair.\nThe blonde soldier limped off to reclaim the purse from where it had fallen, while the big bearded man remained standing over Kvothe. \u201cI suppose you figured you had to try,\u201d he said to the crumpled body, giving him another solid kick in the side. \u201cDamn fool. Pasty little innkeep against two of the king\u2019s own.\u201d He shook his head and spat again. \u201cHonestly, who do you think you are?\u201d\nCurled on the floor, Kvothe began to make a low, rhythmic sound. It was a dry, quiet noise that scratched around the edges of the room. Kvothe paused as he drew a painful breath.\nThe bearded soldier frowned and kicked him again. \u201cI asked you a question, cully . . .\u201d\nThe innkeeper made the same noise again, louder than before. Only then did it become obvious that he was laughing. Each low, broken chuckle sounded like he was coughing up a piece of shattered glass. Despite that, it was a laugh, full of dark amusement, as if the red-haired man had heard a joke that only he could understand.\nIt went on for some time. The bearded soldier shrugged and drew back his foot again.\nChronicler cleared his throat and the two men turned to look at him. \u201cIn the interest of keeping things civilized,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel I should mention that the innkeeper sent his assistant out on an errand. He should be back soon. . . .\u201d\nThe bearded soldier slapped his companion on the chest with the back of his hand. \u201cHe\u2019s right. Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d\n\u201cWait a moment,\u201d the blonde soldier said. He hurried back to the bar and snatched the bottle of wine. \u201cRight, let\u2019s go.\u201d\nThe bearded soldier grinned and went behind the bar, stepping on the innkeeper\u2019s body rather than over it. He grabbed a random bottle, knocking over half a dozen others as he did so. They rolled and spun on the counter between the two huge barrels, a tall, sapphire-colored one slowly toppling over the edge to shatter on the floor.\nIn less than a minute the men had gathered up their packs and were out the", "door.\nChronicler hurried over to where Kvothe lay on the wooden floor. The red-\nhaired man was already struggling into a sitting position.\n\u201cWell that was embarrassing,\u201d Kvothe said. He touched his bloody face\nand looked at his fingers. He chuckled again, a jagged, joyless sound. \u201cForgot who I was there for a minute.\u201d\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Chronicler asked.\nKvothe touched his scalp speculatively. \u201cI\u2019ll need a stitch or two, I suspect.\u201d\n\u201cWhat can I do to help?\u201d Chronicler asked, shifting his weight from foot to foot.\n\u201cDon\u2019t hover over me.\u201d Kvothe pushed himself awkwardly to his feet, then slumped into one of the tall stools at the bar. \u201cIf you want, you can fetch me a glass of water. And maybe a wet cloth.\u201d\nChronicler scurried back into the kitchen. There was the sound of frantic rummaging followed by several things falling to the ground.\nKvothe closed his eyes and leaned heavily against the bar.\n\u201cWhy is the door open?\u201d Bast called as he stepped through the doorway. \u201cIt\u2019s cold as a witch\u2019s tit in here.\u201d He froze, his expression stricken. \u201cReshi! What happened? What . . . I . . . What happened?\u201d\n\u201cAh Bast,\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cClose the door, would you?\u201d\nBast hurried over, a numb expression on his face. Kvothe sat in a stool at the bar, his face swollen and bloody. Chronicler stood next to him, dabbing awkwardly at the innkeeper\u2019s scalp with a damp cloth.\n\u201cI might need to prevail on you for a few stitches, Bast,\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cIf it wouldn\u2019t be too much trouble.\u201d\n\u201cReshi,\u201d Bast repeated. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cDevan and I got into a bit of an argument,\u201d Kvothe said, nodding at the scribe, \u201cabout the proper use of the subjunctive mood. It got a little heated toward the end.\u201d\nChronicler looked up at Bast, then blanched and took several quick steps backward. \u201cHe\u2019s joking!\u201d he said quickly, holding up his hands. \u201cIt was soldiers!\u201d\n \nKvothe chuckled painfully to himself. There was blood on his teeth. Bast looked around the empty taproom. \u201cWhat did you do with them?\u201d \u201cNot much, Bast,\u201d the innkeeper said. \u201cThey\u2019re probably miles away by\nnow.\u201d\n\u201cWas there something wrong with them, Reshi? Like the one last night?\u201d\nBast asked.\n\u201cJust soldiers, Bast,\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cJust two of the king\u2019s own.\u201d\nBast\u2019s face went ashen. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked. \u201cReshi, why did you let them\ndo this?\u201d\nKvothe gave Bast an incredulous look. He gave a brief, bitter laugh, then\nstopped with a wince, sucking air through his teeth. \u201cWell they seemed like such clean and virtuous boys,\u201d he said, his voice mocking. \u201cI thought, why not let these nice fellows rob me then beat me to a pulp?\u201d\nBast expression was full of dismay. \u201cBut you\u2014\u201d\nKvothe wiped away the blood that was threatening to run into his eye, then looked at Bast as if he were the stupidest creature drawing breath in the entire world. \u201cWhat?\u201d he demanded. \u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d\n\u201cTwo soldiers, Reshi?\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d Kvothe shouted. \u201cNot even two! Apparently one thick-fisted thug is all it takes to beat me half to death!\u201d He glared furiously at Bast, throwing up his arms. \u201cWhat is it going to take to shut you up? Do you want a story? Do you want to hear the details?\u201d\nBast took a step backward at the outburst. His face went even paler, his expression panicked.\nKvothe let his arms fall heavily to his sides. \u201cQuit expecting me to be something I\u2019m not,\u201d he said, still breathing hard. He hunched his shoulders and rubbed at his eyes, smearing blood across his face. He let his head sag wearily. \u201cGod\u2019s mother, why can\u2019t you just leave me alone?\u201d\nBast stood as still as a startled hart, his eyes wide.\nSilence flooded the room, thick and bitter as a lungful of smoke.\nKvothe drew a slow breath, the only motion in the room. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Bast,\u201d\nhe said without looking up. \u201cI\u2019m just in a little pain right now. It got the better of me. Give me a moment and I\u2019ll have it sorted out.\u201d\nStill looking down, Kvothe closed his eyes and drew several slow, shallow breaths. When he looked up, his expression was chagrined. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Bast,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to snap at you.\u201d\nA touch of the color returned to Bast\u2019s cheeks, and some of the tension left", "his shoulders as he gave a nervous smile.\nKvothe took the damp cloth from Chronicler and wiped the blood away\nfrom his eye again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I interrupted you before, Bast. What is it you were about ask me?\u201d\nBast hesitated, then said. \u201cYou killed five scrael not three days ago, Reshi.\u201d He waved toward the door. \u201cWhat\u2019s some thug compared to that?\u201d\n\u201cI picked the time and place for the scrael rather carefully, Bast,\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t exactly dance away unscathed, either.\u201d\nChronicler looked up, surprised. \u201cYou were hurt?\u201d he asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t know. You didn\u2019t look it. . . .\u201d\nA small, wry smile twisted the corner of Kvothe\u2019s mouth. \u201cOld habits die hard,\u201d he said. \u201cI do have a reputation to maintain. Besides, we heroes are only hurt in properly dramatic ways. It rather ruins the story if you find out Bast had to knit about ten feet of stitches into me after the fight.\u201d\nRealization broke over Bast\u2019s face like a sunrise. \u201cOf course!\u201d he said, his voice thick with relief. \u201cI forgot. You\u2019re still hurt from the scrael. I knew it had to be something like that.\u201d\nKvothe looked at the floor, every line of his body sagging and weary. \u201cBast . . .\u201d he began.\n\u201cI knew it, Reshi,\u201d Bast said emphatically. \u201cThere\u2019s no way some thug could get the better of you.\u201d\nKvothe drew a shallow breath, then let it out in a rush. \u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s it, Bast,\u201d he said easily. \u201cI expect I could have taken them both if I\u2019d been fresh.\u201d\nBast\u2019s expression grew uncertain again. He turned to face Chronicler. \u201cHow could you let this happen?\u201d he demanded.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not his fault, Bast,\u201d Kvothe said absentmindedly. \u201cI started the fight.\u201d He put a few fingers into his mouth and felt around gingerly. His fingers came out of his mouth bright with blood. \u201cI expect I\u2019m going to lose this tooth,\u201d he mused.\n\u201cYou will not lose your tooth, Reshi,\u201d Bast said fiercely. \u201cYou will not.\u201d\nKvothe made a slight motion with his shoulders, as if trying to shrug without moving any more of his body than he needed to. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter much in the grand scheme of things, Bast.\u201d He pressed the cloth to his scalp then looked at it. \u201cI probably won\u2019t need those stitches, either.\u201d He pushed himself upright on the stool. \u201cLet\u2019s have our dinner and get back to the story.\u201d He raised an eyebrow at Chronicler. \u201cIf you\u2019re still up for it, of", "course.\u201d\nChronicler stared at him blankly.\n\u201cReshi,\u201d Bast said, worried. \u201cYou\u2019re a mess.\u201d He reached out. \u201cLet me\nlook at your eyes.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not concussed, Bast,\u201d Kvothe said, irritated. \u201cI\u2019ve got four broken\nribs, a ringing in my ears, and a loose tooth. I have a few minor scalp wounds that look more serious than they really are. My nose is bloody but not broken, and tomorrow I will be a vast tapestry of bruises.\u201d\nKvothe gave the faint shrug again. \u201cStill, I\u2019ve had worse. Besides, they reminded me of something I was close to forgetting. I should probably thank them for that.\u201d He prodded at his jaw speculatively and worked his tongue around in his mouth. \u201cPerhaps not a terribly warm thanks.\u201d\n\u201cReshi, you need stitches,\u201d Bast said. \u201cAnd you need to let me do something about that tooth.\u201d\nKvothe climbed off the stool. \u201cI\u2019ll just chew on the other side for a few days.\u201d\nBast took hold of Kvothe\u2019s arm. His eyes were hard and dark. \u201cSit down Reshi.\u201d It was nothing like a request. His voice was low and sudden, like a throb of distant thunder. \u201cSit. Down.\u201d\nKvothe sat.\nChronicler nodded approvingly and turned to Bast. \u201cWhat can I do to help?\u201d\n\u201cStay out of my way,\u201d Bast said brusquely. \u201cAnd keep him in this chair until I get back.\u201d He strode upstairs.\nThere was a moment of silence.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Chronicler said. \u201cSubjunctive mood.\u201d\n\u201cAt best,\u201d Kvothe said, \u201cit is a pointless thing. It needlessly complicates\nthe language. It offends me.\u201d\n\u201cOh come now,\u201d Chronicler said, sounding slightly offended. \u201cThe\nsubjunctive is the heart of the hypothetical. In the right hands . . .\u201d He broke off as Bast stormed back into the room, scowling and carrying a small wooden box.\n\u201cBring me water,\u201d Bast said imperiously to Chronicler. \u201cFresh from the rain barrel, not from the pump. Then I need milk from the icebox, some warmed honey, and a broad bowl. Then clean up this mess and stay out of my way.\u201d\nBast washed the cut on Kvothe\u2019s scalp, then threaded one of his own hairs", "through a bone needle and laced four tight stitches through the innkeeper\u2019s skin more smoothly than a seamstress.\n\u201cOpen your mouth,\u201d Bast said, then peered inside, frowning while he prodded one of the back teeth with a finger. He nodded to himself.\nBast handed Kvothe the glass of water. \u201cRinse out your mouth, Reshi. Do it a couple times and spit the water back into the cup.\u201d\nKvothe did. When he finished the water was red as wine.\nChronicler returned with a bottle of milk. Bast sniffed it, then poured a splash into a wide pottery bowl. He added a dollop of honey and swirled it around to mix it. Finally, he dipped his finger into the glass of bloody water, drew it out, and let a single drop fall into the bowl.\nBast swirled it again and handed Kvothe the bowl. \u201cTake a mouthful of this,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t swallow it. Hold it in your mouth until I tell you.\u201d\nHis expression curious, Kvothe tipped the bowl and took a mouthful of the milk.\nBast took a mouthful as well. Then he closed his eyes for a long moment, a look of intense concentration on his face. Then he opened his eyes. He brought the bowl close to Kvothe\u2019s mouth and pointed into it.\nKvothe spat out his mouthful of milk. It was a perfect, creamy white.\nBast brought the bowl to his own mouth and spat. It was a frothy pink. Kvothe\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cBast,\u201d he said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\nBast made a sharp gesture with one hand, his eyes still hard. \u201cI did not ask\nfor your opinion, Reshi.\u201d\nThe innkeeper looked down, uncomfortable. \u201cIt\u2019s more than you should\ndo, Bast.\u201d\nThe dark young man reached out and laid a gentle hand on the side of his\nmaster\u2019s face. For a moment he looked tired, weary through to the bone. Bast shook his head slowly, wearing an expression of bemused dismay. \u201cYou are an idiot, Reshi.\u201d\nBast drew his hand back, and the weariness was gone. He pointed across the bar where Chronicler stood watching. \u201cBring the food.\u201d He pointed at Kvothe. \u201cTell the story.\u201d\nThen he spun on his heel, walked back to his chair by the hearth, and lowered himself into it as if it were a throne. He clapped his hands twice, sharply. \u201cEntertain me!\u201d he said with a wide, mad smile. And even from where the others stood near the bar, they could see the blood on his teeth.", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-SEVEN\nQuestions\nWHILE THE MAYOR OF Levinshir seemed to approve of how I\u2019d handled the false troupers, I knew matters weren\u2019t as simple as that. According to the iron law, I was guilty of at least three egregious crimes, any one of which would be enough to see me hanged.\nUnfortunately, everyone in Levinshir knew my name and description, and I worried the story might run ahead of me on the road. If that happened, I could easily come to a town where the local constables would do their duty and lock me up until a traveling magistrate arrived to judge my case.\nSo I made my best speed toward Severen. I put in two days of hard walking, then paid for a seat on a coach heading south. Rumor travels fast, but you can keep ahead of it if you\u2019re willing to ride hard and lose a little sleep.\nAfter three days of bone-jarring ride, I arrived in Severen. The coach entered the city by the eastern gate, and for the first time I saw the gibbet Bredon had told me about. The sight of the bleached bones in the iron cage did not ease my anxieties. The Maer had put a man in there for simple banditry. What might he do to someone who had slaughtered nine traveling players on the road?\nI was sorely tempted to head straight to the Four Tapers, where I hoped to find Denna despite what the Cthaeh had said. But I was covered in several days of grime and sweat. I needed a bath and a brush before I spoke with anyone.\nAs soon as I was inside the Maer\u2019s estate I sent a ring and note to Stapes, knowing it would be the quickest way to get in touch with the Maer for a private conversation. I made it back to my room with little delay, though it meant brushing roughly past a few courtiers in the halls. I had just set down my travelsack and sent runners for hot water when Stapes appeared in the doorway.\n\u201cYoung Master Kvothe!\u201d he beamed, grabbing my hand to shake it. \u201cIt\u2019s", "good to have you back. Lord and lady, but I\u2019ve been worried about you.\u201d\nHis enthusiasm wrung a tired smile from me. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be back, Stapes.\nHave I missed much?\u201d\n\u201cMuch?\u201d He laughed. \u201cThe wedding for one.\u201d\n\u201cWedding?\u201d I asked, but I knew the answer as soon as I said it. \u201cThe\nMaer\u2019s wedding?\u201d\nStapes nodded excitedly. \u201cOh, it was a grand thing. It\u2019s a shame you had to\nbe gone for it, considering.\u201d He gave a knowing look, but didn\u2019t say anything else. Stapes was always very discreet.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t waste much time, did they?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been two months since the betrothal,\u201d Stapes said with a hint of reproach. \u201cNot a bit less than proper.\u201d I saw him relax a bit, and he gave me a wink. \u201cWhich isn\u2019t to say they weren\u2019t both a bit eager.\u201d\nI chuckled as runner boys came through the open door with buckets of steaming water. The splashing as they began to fill the bath was like sweet music.\nThe manservant watched them leave, then leaned close and said in a quieter voice, \u201cYou\u2019ll be glad to hear our other unresolved matter has been tended to properly.\u201d\nI looked at him blankly, searching through my memory for what he might be referring to. So much had happened since I\u2019d left....\nStapes saw my expression. \u201cCaudicus,\u201d he said, his mouth twisting bitterly around the name. \u201cDagon brought him back only two days after you left. He\u2019d gone to ground not ten miles from the city.\u201d\n\u201cSo close?\u201d I asked, surprised.\nStapes nodded grimly. \u201cHe was tucked away in a farmhouse like a badger in a burrow. He killed four of the Maer\u2019s personal guard and cost Dagon an eye. In the end they only caught him by setting fire to the place.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what happened then?\u201d I asked. \u201cNot a trial, certainly.\u201d\n\u201cThe matter was tended to,\u201d Stapes repeated. \u201cProperly.\u201d He said the last with a great weight of grim finality. His normally kind eyes were narrow with hate. In that moment the round-faced little man looked very little like a grocer at all.\nI remembered Alveron calmly saying, \u201ctake off his thumbs.\u201d Given what I knew of Alveron\u2019s swift and decisive anger, I doubted anyone would ever see Caudicus again.\n\u201cDid the Maer manage to uncover why?\u201d Even though I spoke softly, I left", "the rest unsaid, knowing Stapes would not approve of my mentioning the poisoning openly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my place to say,\u201d Stapes said carefully. His tone was slightly offended, as if I should know better than to ask him such things.\nI let the subject go, knowing that I wouldn\u2019t be able to get anything else out of Stapes. \u201cYou\u2019d be doing me a favor if you could deliver something to the Maer for me,\u201d I said, walking to where I\u2019d dropped my worn travelsack. I rooted through it until I found the Maer\u2019s lockbox down near the bottom.\nI held it out to Stapes. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s in it,\u201d I said. \u201cBut it\u2019s got his crest on the top. And it\u2019s heavy. I hope it might be some of the taxes that were stolen.\u201d I smiled. \u201cTell him it\u2019s a wedding present.\u201d\nStapes took hold of the box, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be delighted.\u201d\nThree more runners appeared, but only two of them ran past with steaming buckets. The third went to Stapes and handed him a note. There was more splashing in the other room, and all three of the boys left again, stealing glances at me\nStapes skimmed the note then looked up at me. \u201cThe Maer is hoping it would be convenient for you to meet him in the garden at fifth bell,\u201d he said.\nThe garden meant polite conversation. If the Maer had wanted a serious discussion he would have summoned me to his rooms, or paid me a call through the secret passage that connected his rooms with mine.\nI looked at the clock on the wall. It wasn\u2019t a sympathy clock of the sort I was used to at the University. This was a harmony clock, swinging pendulum and all. Beautiful machinery, but not nearly as accurate. Its hands showed a quarter to the hour.\n\u201cIs that clock fast, Stapes?\u201d I asked hopefully. Fifteen minutes was barely enough time for me to strip out of my road clothes and lace myself into some sufficiently decorous court finery. But given the layers of dirt and sour sweat that covered me, that would be as pointless as tying a silk ribbon around a steaming cowpat.\nStapes looked over my shoulder, then checked a small gear watch he kept in his pocket. \u201cIt looks about five minutes slow, actually.\u201d\nI rubbed my face, considering my options. I wasn\u2019t simply mussed from a day\u2019s travel. I was filthy. I had walked hard under the summer sun, then spent days trapped in a stifling-hot carriage. While the Maer was not one to judge things entirely by appearances, he did value propriety. I would not make a good impression if I showed up reeking and filthy.", "Unbidden, the memory of the iron gibbet rose up in my mind, and I decided I couldn\u2019t risk making a bad impression. Not with the news I brought. \u201cStapes, I won\u2019t be ready for at least an hour. I could meet with him at sixth bell if he would like.\u201d\nStapes\u2019 expression turned stiff and affronted. Its message was clear. You simply didn\u2019t request a different meeting time with the Maer Alveron. He asked. You came. That was the way of things.\n\u201cStapes,\u201d I said as gently as I could. \u201cLook at me. Smell me. I\u2019ve come three hundred miles in the last span of days. I\u2019m not going to go strolling in the garden covered in road dust and reeking like a barbarian.\u201d\nStapes\u2019 mouth firmed into a frown. \u201cI\u2019ll tell him you\u2019re otherwise occupied.\u201d\nMore steaming buckets arrived. \u201cTell him the truth, Stapes,\u201d I said as I began to unbutton my shirt. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll understand.\u201d\nAfter I was scrubbed, brushed, and properly dressed, I sent the Maer my golden ring and a card that said, \u201cPrivate conversation at your earliest convenience.\u201d\nWithin an hour a runner returned with a card from the Maer saying, \u201cAwait my summons.\u201d\nI waited. I sent a runner to fetch dinner, then waited the rest of the evening. The following day passed without any further message. And, because I didn\u2019t know when Alveron\u2019s summons might come, I was effectively trapped in my rooms again, waiting for his ring.\nIt was nice to have time to catch up on my sleep and have a second bath. But I was worried about the news from Levinshir catching up with me. The fact that I couldn\u2019t make my way down to Severen-Low to look for Denna was a vast irritation as well.\nIt was the sort of silent rebuke all too common in courtly settings. The Maer\u2019s message was clear: When I call, you come. My terms or not at all.\nIt was childish in the way only the nobility can be. Still, there was nothing to be done. So I sent my silver ring to Bredon. He arrived in time to share supper with me and caught me up on the season\u2019s worth of gossip I\u2019d missed. Court rumor can be terribly insipid stuff, but Bredon skimmed the cream off\n \nthe top for me.\nMost of it centered around the Maer\u2019s whirlwind courtship and marriage to\nthe Lackless heir. They were besotted with each other, apparently. Many suspected a child might already be on the way. The royal court in Renere was busy too. The Prince Regent Alaitis had been killed in a duel, sending much of the southern farrel into chaos as various nobility did their best to capitalize on the death of such a highly ranked member of the court.\nThere were rumors too. The Maer\u2019s men had taken care of some bandits off in a remote piece of the Eld. They\u2019d been waylaying tax collectors, apparently. There was grumbling in the north, where folk had to suffer a second visit from the Maer\u2019s collectors. But at least the roads were clear again, and those responsible were dead.\nBredon also mentioned an interesting rumor of a young man who had gone to visit Felurian and come back more or less intact, though slightly fae around the edges. It wasn\u2019t a court rumor, exactly. More the sort of thing you heard in a taproom. A low sort of rumor no highborn person would ever deign to lend an ear to. His dark, owlish eyes glittered merrily as he spoke.\nI agreed that such stories were indeed quite low, and beneath the notice of fine persons such as ourselves. My cloak? It was rather fine, was it not? I couldn\u2019t remember where exactly I\u2019d had it tailored. Somewhere exotic. By the way, I\u2019d heard quite an interesting song the other day on the subject of Felurian. Would he like to hear it?\nWe also played tak, of course. Despite the fact that I had spent a long time away from the board, Bredon said my playing was much improved. It seemed I was learning how to play a beautiful game.\nNeedless to say, when Alveron sent his next summons, I came. I was tempted to arrive a few minutes late, but I resisted, knowing no good could come of it. The Maer was walking about on his own when I met him in the garden. He\nstood straight and tall, looking for all the world as if he\u2019d never needed to lean on my arm or use a walking stick.\n\u201cKvothe,\u201d he smiled warmly. \u201cI\u2019m glad you could find time to visit me.\u201d \u201cAlways my pleasure, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cShall we walk?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe view is pleasant from the south bridge\n \nthis time of day.\u201d\nI fell into step beside him, and we began to wind our way among the\ncarefully tended hedges.\n\u201cI could not help but notice that you are armed,\u201d he remarked, disapproval\nheavy on his voice.\nMy hand went unconsciously to Caesura. It was at my hip now, rather than\nover my shoulder. \u201cIs there aught amiss with that, your grace? I have understood that all men keep the right to gird themselves in Vintas.\u201d\n\u201cIt is hardly proper.\u201d He stressed the word.\n\u201cI understand that in the king\u2019s court in Renere, there\u2019s not a gentleman would dare be seen without a sword.\u201d\n\u201cWell-spoken as you are, you are no gentleman,\u201d Alveron pointed out coolly, \u201cas you would do well to remember.\u201d\nI said nothing.\n\u201cBesides, it is a barbarian custom, and one that will bring the king to grief in time. No matter what the custom in Renere, in my city, my house, and my garden, you will not come before me armed.\u201d He turned to look at me with hard eyes.\n\u201cI apologize if I have given any offense, your grace.\u201d I stopped and offered him a more earnest bow than the one I\u2019d given before.\nMy show of submission seemed to appease him. He smiled and laid a hand on my shoulder. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for all that. Come, look at the mourningfire. The leaves will be turning soon.\u201d\nWe walked for a piece of an hour, chatting amiably about small nothings. I was unfailingly polite and Alveron\u2019s mood continued to improve. If catering to his ego kept me in his good graces, it was a small price to pay for his patronage.\n\u201cI must say that marriage suits your grace.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d He nodded graciously. \u201cI have found it much to my liking.\u201d \u201cAnd your health continues well?\u201d I asked, pressing the boundaries of\npublic conversation.\n\u201cExceeding well,\u201d he said. \u201cAnother benefit of married life, no doubt.\u201d He\ngave me a look that told me he would not appreciate further inquiry, at least not in so public a place as this.\nWe continued our walk, nodding to the nobles we passed. The Maer chatted on about trivialities, rumors in the court. I played along, filling my part in the conversation. But the truth was, I needed to have done with this so", "we could have an earnest conversation in private.\nBut I also knew Alveron could not be rushed into a discussion. Our talks\nhad a ritual pattern. If I violated that, I would do nothing but annoy him. So I bided my time, smelled the flowers, and pretended interest in the gossip of the court.\nAfter a quarter hour, there was a characteristic pause in the conversation. Next we would engage in an argument. After that we could go somewhere private enough to speak of important matters.\n\u201cI have always thought,\u201d Alveron said at last, introducing the topic of our discussion, \u201cthat everyone has a question that rests in the center of who they are.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you mean, your grace?\u201d\n\u201cI believe everyone has some question that drives them. A question that keeps them awake nights. A question they worry like a dog with an old bone. If you understand a man\u2019s question, it brings you closer to understanding the man himself.\u201d He looked sideways at me, half-smiling. \u201cOr so I have always believed.\u201d\nI thought on it for a moment. \u201cI would have to agree with you, your grace.\u201d\nAlveron raised an eyebrow at this. \u201cAs easy as that?\u201d He sounded slightly disappointed. \u201cI was expecting a bit of a struggle from you.\u201d\nI shook my head, glad for the easy opportunity to introduce a topic of my own. \u201cI\u2019ve been worrying at a question for some years now, and I expect I will worry it some few years more. So what you say makes a perfect sense to me.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d he said hungrily. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\nI considered telling him the truth. About my search for the Chandrian and the death of my troupe. But there was no real chance of that. That secret still sat in my heart, heavy as a great smooth stone. It was too personal a thing to tell someone as clever as the Maer. What\u2019s more, it would reveal my Edema Ruh blood, something I had not made public knowledge in the Maer\u2019s court. The Maer knew I wasn\u2019t nobility, but he didn\u2019t know my blood was quite so low as that.\n\u201cIt must be a heavy question for you to take so long in weighing it,\u201d Alveron joked as I hesitated. \u201cCome, I insist. In fact I will offer you a trade, a question for a question. Mayhap we will help each other to an answer.\u201d\nI could hardly hope for better encouragement than that. I thought for a moment, choosing my words carefully. \u201cWhere are the Amyr?\u201d", "\u201cThe bloody-handed Amyr,\u201d Alveron mused softly to himself. He glanced sideways at me. \u201cI assume you are not asking where their bodies are bestowed?\u201d\n\u201cNo, your grace,\u201d I said somberly.\nHis face turned thoughtful. \u201cInteresting.\u201d I drew a relieved breath. I had half expected him to give a flip response, to tell me the Amyr were centuries dead. Instead he said, \u201cI studied the Amyr a great deal when I was younger, you know.\u201d\n\u201cTruly, your grace?\u201d I said, surprised by my own good luck.\nHe looked at me, a ghost of a smile touching his lips. \u201cNot that surprising. I wanted to be one of the Amyr when I was a boy.\u201d He looked ever so slightly embarrassed. \u201cNot all the stories are dark, you know. They did important things. They made hard choices that no one else was willing to. That sort of thing frightens people, but I believe they were a great force for good.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always thought so too,\u201d I admitted. \u201cOut of curiosity, which was your favorite story?\u201d\n\u201cAtreyon,\u201d Alveron said a little wistfully. \u201cI haven\u2019t thought of that in years. I could probably recite the Eight Oaths of Atreyon from memory.\u201d He shook his head and glanced in my direction. \u201cAnd you?\u201d\n\u201cAtreyon is a bit bloody for me,\u201d I admitted.\nAlveron looked amused. \u201cThey weren\u2019t called the bloody-handed Amyr for nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tattoos of the Ciradae were hardly decorative.\u201d\n\u201cTrue,\u201d I admitted. \u201cStill, I prefer Sir Savien.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, nodding. \u201cYou\u2019re a romantic.\u201d\nWe walked in silence for a moment, turning a corner and strolling past a\nfountain. \u201cI was enamored with them as a child,\u201d Alveron said at last, as if confessing something slightly embarassing. \u201cMen and women with all the power of the church behind them. And that was at a time when all the power of Atur stood behind the church.\u201d He smiled. \u201cBrave, fierce, and answerable to no one save themselves and God.\u201d\n\u201cAnd other Amyr,\u201d I added.\n\u201cAnd, ultimately, the pontifex,\u201d he finished. \u201cI assume you\u2019ve read his proclamation declaiming them?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nWe came to a small arching bridge of wood and stone, then stopped at the top of the arch and looked out over the water, watching the swans maneuver", "slowly on the current. \u201cDo you know what I found when I was younger?\u201d the Maer asked.\nI shook my head.\n\u201cOnce I\u2019d grown too old for children\u2019s stories of the Amyr, I started wondering more specific things. How many Amyr were there? How many were gentry? How many horse could they put to field for an armed action?\u201d He turned slightly to gauge my reaction. \u201cI was in Felton at the time. They have an old Aturan mendary where they keep church records for the whole of the northern farrel. I looked through their books for two days. Do you know what I found?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d I said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t find anything.\u201d\nAlveron turned to look at me. His expression held a carefully controlled surprise.\n\u201cI found the same thing at the University,\u201d I said. \u201cIt seemed as if someone had removed information about the Amyr from the Archives there. Not everything, of course. But there were scarce few solid details.\u201d\nI could see the Maer\u2019s own conclusions sparking to life behind his clever grey eyes. \u201cAnd who would do such a thing?\u201d he prompted.\n\u201cWho would have better reason than the Amyr themselves?\u201d I said. \u201cWhich means they are still around, somewhere.\u201d\n\u201cThus your question.\u201d Alveron started walking again, slower than before. \u201cWhere are the Amyr?\u201d\nWe left the bridge and began to walk the path around the pond, the Maer\u2019s face full of serious thought. \u201cWould you believe I had the same thought after searching in the mendary?\u201d he asked me. \u201cI thought the Amyr might have avoided being brought to trial. Gone into hiding. I thought there might even be Amyr in the world after all this while, acting in secret for the greater good.\u201d\nI could feel the excitement bubbling in my chest. \u201cWhat did you discover?\u201d I asked eagerly.\n\u201cDiscover?\u201d Alveron looked surprised. \u201cNothing. My father died that year and I became Maer. I dismissed it as a boyish fancy.\u201d He looked out over the water and the gently gliding swans. \u201cBut if you found this same thing half a world away. . . .\u201d He trailed off.\n\u201cAnd I drew the same conclusion, your grace.\u201d\nAlveron nodded slowly. \u201cIt is disturbing that there might be a secret this important.\u201d He looked around the garden at the walls of his estate. \u201cAnd in", "my own lands. I don\u2019t like that.\u201d He turned back to me, his eyes sharp and clear. \u201cHow do you propose to search them out?\u201d\nI smiled ruefully. \u201cAs your grace pointed out, no matter how well-spoken or well-educated I am, I will never be nobility. I lack the connections and the resources to research this as thoroughly as I would like. But with your name to open doors, I could make a search of many private libraries. I could access archives and records too private or too hidden to be pruned. . . .\u201d\nAlveron nodded, his eyes not leaving mine. \u201cI think I understand you. I, for one, would give a great deal to know the truth of this matter.\u201d\nHe looked away as the sound of laughter drifted upward, mixing with the footsteps of a group of approaching nobles. \u201cYou\u2019ve given me a great deal to think about,\u201d he said in softer tones. \u201cWe will discuss this further in more privacy.\u201d\n\u201cWhat time would be convenient for you to meet, your grace?\u201d\nAlveron gave me a long, speculative look. \u201cCome to my rooms this evening. And since I cannot give you an answer, let me offer you a question of my own instead.\u201d\n\u201cI value questions near as much, your grace.\u201d", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-EIGHT\nNotes\nWITH NEARLY FIVE HOURS until my meeting with the Maer, I was finally free to go about my business in Severen-Low. From the horse lifts, the sky was so clear and blue it could break your heart to look at it. With that in mind, I made my way to the Four Tapers inn.\nThe taproom wasn\u2019t busy, so it isn\u2019t surprising that the innkeeper spotted me heading toward the back stairs. \u201cStop you!\u201d he called out in broken Aturan. \u201cPay! Room only for paying men!\u201d\nNot wanting a scene, I approached the bar. The innkeeper was a thin, greasy man with a thick Lenatti accent. I smiled at him. \u201cI was just visiting a friend. The woman in room three. Long dark hair.\u201d I gestured to show how long. \u201cIs she still here?\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d he said, giving me a knowing look. \u201cThe girl. Her name Dinay?\u201d\nI nodded, knowing Denna changed her name as often as some other women changed their hair.\nThe greasy man nodded again. \u201cYes. The pretty dark eyes? She gone for long.\u201d\nMy heart fell, despite the fact that I\u2019d known better than to hope she would still be here after all this time. \u201cDo you know where she might have gone?\u201d\nHe barked a short laugh. \u201cNo. You and all the other wolves come sniffing after her. I could have sold knowing to you all to made a thick purse. But no, I haen\u2019t idea.\u201d\n\u201cMight she have left a message for me?\u201d I asked without real hope. I hadn\u2019t found any letter or note waiting for me at Alveron\u2019s estate. \u201cShe was expecting me to find her here.\u201d\n\u201cWas she?\u201d he said mockingly, then seemed to remember something. \u201cI think there a note found. Might be. Not much a reader me. You would like it?\u201d He smiled.\nI nodded, my heart lifting a little.\n\u201cShe left without payment in her room,\u201d he said. \u201cSeventeen and a half", "pennies.\u201d\nI brought out a silver round and showed it to him. He reached for it, but I\nset it on the table and held it there with two fingers.\nHe scurried off into a back room and was gone for a long five minutes. He\nfinally returned with a tightly folded piece of paper clutched in one hand. \u201cI am find it,\u201d he said triumphantly, waving it in my direction. \u201cNot much good for paper here but kindling.\u201d\nI looked at the piece of paper and felt my spirits lift. It was folded against itself in the same fashion as the letter I\u2019d had the tinker deliver. If she\u2019d copied that trick, it meant she must have read my letter and left this note for me. Hopefully it would tell me where she had gone. How to find her. I slid the coin toward the innkeeper and took the note.\nOnce outside, I hurried to the shadow of a recessed doorway, knowing it was the closest thing to privacy I would find on the busy street. I tore the note open carefully, unfolded it, and edged into the light. It read:\nDenna,\nI have been forced to leave town on an errand for my patron. I will be\naway some time, perhaps several span. It was sudden and unavoidable, else I would have made a point to see you before I left.\nI regret many of the things I said when we last spoke and wish I could apologize for them in person.\nI will find you when I return. Yours,\nKvothe\nAt eighth bell I made my way to the Maer\u2019s rooms, leaving Caesura behind. I felt oddly naked without it. It\u2019s strange how quickly we become accustomed to such things.\nStapes showed me into the Maer\u2019s sitting room, and Alveron sent his manservant to invite Meluan to join us at her convenience. I wondered idly what would happen if she decided not to come? Would he ignore her for three days in silent rebuke?\n \nAlveron settled onto a couch and gave me a speculative look. \u201cI\u2019ve heard some rumors surrounding your recent excursion,\u201d he said. \u201cSome rather fantastic things I\u2019m not given to believing. Perhaps you\u2019d like to tell me what really happened.\u201d\nFor a moment I wondered how he\u2019d managed to hear about my activities near Levinshir so quickly. Then I realized he wanted to know the details of our bandit hunt in the Eld. I breathed a mental sigh of relief. \u201cI trust Dedan found you easily enough?\u201d I asked.\nAlveron nodded.\n\u201cI regretted having to send him in my stead, your grace. He is not a subtle creature.\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cNo real harm was done. By the time he came to me the need for secrecy was past.\u201d\n\u201cHe did deliver my letter then?\u201d\n\u201cAh yes, the letter.\u201d Alveron pulled it out of a nearby drawer. \u201cI assumed it was some sort of odd joke.\u201d\n\u201cYour grace?\u201d\nHe gave me a frank stare, then looked down at my letter. \u201cTwenty-seven men,\u201d he read aloud. \u201cExperienced mercenaries by their actions and appearance . . . A well-established camp with rudimentary fortifications.\u201d He looked up again, \u201cYou can\u2019t expect me to believe this as the truth. The five of you couldn\u2019t possibly succeed against so many.\u201d\n\u201cWe surprised them, your grace,\u201d I said with a certain smug understatement.\nThe Maer\u2019s expression soured. \u201cCome now, all provincial humor aside, I consider this to be in extremely poor taste. Simply tell me the truth and have done.\u201d\n\u201cI have told you the truth, your grace. Had I known you would require proof I would have let Dedan bring you a sackful of thumbs. It took a full hour of arguing to drive the notion out of his head.\u201d\nThis didn\u2019t set the Maer back as I expected. \u201cPerhaps you should have let him,\u201d he said.\nThe humor of the situation was rapidly fading for me. \u201cYour grace, if I were to lie to you, I would choose a more convincing tale.\u201d I let him consider this for a moment. \u201cBesides, if all you want is proof, simply send someone out to verify it. We burned the bodies, but the skulls will still be there. I\u2019ll mark their camp for you on a map.\u201d", "The Maer took a different tack. \u201cWhat of this other part? Their leader. The man who didn\u2019t mind being shot through the leg? The one who stepped into his tent and \u2018disappeared\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cTrue, your grace.\u201d\nAlveron eyed me for a long moment, then sighed. \u201cThen I believe you,\u201d he said. \u201cBut still, it\u2019s strange and bitter news,\u201d he muttered, almost to himself.\n\u201cIndeed, your grace.\u201d\nHe gave me an oddly calculating look. \u201cWhat do you make of it?\u201d Before I could answer, there was the sound of a female voice from the\nouter rooms. Alveron\u2019s scowl vanished and he sat up straighter in his chair. I hid a smile behind my hand.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Meluan,\u201d Alveron said. \u201cIf I am correct, she is bringing us the question I mentioned earlier.\u201d He gave me a sly smile. \u201cI think you will enjoy it, a puzzling thing indeed.\u201d", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-NINE\nLockless\nSTAPES ESCORTED MELUAN INTO the room while Alveron and I rose to our feet. She was dressed in grey and lavender, and her curling chestnut hair was pulled back to reveal her elegant neck.\nMeluan was followed by two serving boys carrying a wooden chest. The Maer moved to take his wife\u2019s elbow, while Stapes directed the boys to set the chest to one side of her chair. Alveron\u2019s manservant hurried them outside and gave me a conspiratorial wink before he closed the door behind himself.\nStill standing, I turned to Meluan and made my bows. \u201cI am pleased to have the chance to meet with you again . . . my lady?\u201d I made the last a question as I wasn\u2019t sure how to address her. The Lackless lands used to be a full earldom, but that was before the bloodless rebellion, when they still controlled Tinu\u00eb. Her marriage to the Alveron complicated things too, as I wasn\u2019t sure if there was a female counterpart to the title of Maershon.\nMeluan waved her hand easily, dismissing the issue entirely. \u201cLady is well enough between us two, at least when we are closeted. I\u2019ve no need for formality from one to whom I owe so great a debt.\u201d She took hold of Alveron\u2019s hand. \u201cPlease sit if you\u2019ve a mind.\u201d\nI made another bow and took my seat, eyeing the chest as casually as possible. It was about the size of a large drum, made of well-jointed birch and bound in brass.\nI knew the proper thing to do was engage in polite small talk until the matter of the chest was broached by one of the two of them. However, my curiosity got the better of me. \u201cI was told you were bringing a question with you. It must be a weighty one for you to keep it so tightly bound.\u201d I made a nod toward the chest.\nMeluan looked at Alveron and laughed as if he had told a joke. \u201cMy husband said you weren\u2019t the type to let a puzzle sit for very long.\u201d\nI gave a slightly shamefaced smile. \u201cIt goes against my nature, lady.\u201d \u201cI would not have you battle your nature on my account.\u201d She smiled.", "\u201cWould you be so good as to bring it round in front of me?\u201d\nI managed to lift the chest without hurting myself, but if it weighed less\nthan ten stone then I\u2019m a poet.\nMeluan sat forward in her chair, leaning over the chest. \u201cLerand has told\nme of the part you played in bringing us together. For that, my thanks. I hold myself in debt to you.\u201d Her dark brown eyes were gravely serious. \u201cHowever, I also consider the greater piece of that debt repaid by what I am about to show you. I can count on both hands the people who have seen this. Debt or no, I would never have considered showing you had not my husband vouchsafed me your full discretion.\u201d She gave me a pointed look.\n\u201cBy my hand, I will not speak of what I see to anyone,\u201d I assured her, trying not to seem as eager as I was.\nMeluan nodded. Then, rather than drawing out a key as I\u2019d expected, she pressed her hands to the sides of the chest and slid two panels slightly. There was a soft click and the lid sprang slightly ajar.\nLockless, I thought to myself.\nThe open lid revealed another chest, smaller and flatter. It was the size of a bread box, and its flat brass lockplate held a keyhole that was not keyhole shaped, but a simple circle instead. Meluan drew something from a chain around her neck.\n\u201cMay I see that?\u201d I asked.\nMeluan seemed surprised. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cThat key. May I see it for a moment?\u201d\n\u201cGod\u2019s bother,\u201d Alveron exclaimed. \u201cWe haven\u2019t come to the interesting\nbit yet. I offer you the mystery of an age and you admire the wrapping paper!\u201d\nMeluan handed me the key, and I gave it a quick but thorough examination, turning it in my hands. \u201cI like to take my mysteries layer by layer,\u201d I explained.\n\u201cLike an onion?\u201d He snorted.\n\u201cLike a flower,\u201d I countered, handing the key back to Meluan. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nMeluan fit the key and opened the lid of the inner chest. She slid the chain back around her neck, tucked it underneath her clothes, and rearranged her clothes and hair, repairing any damage done to her appearance. This seemed to take an hour or so.\nFinally she reached forward and lifted something out of the chest with both", "hands. Holding it just out of my sight behind the open lid, she looked up at me and took a deep breath. \u201cThis has been . . .\u201d she began.\n\u201cJust let him see it, dear,\u201d Alveron interjected gently. \u201cI\u2019m curious to see what he thinks on his own.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cBesides, I fear the boy will have a fit if you keep him waiting any longer.\u201d\nReverently, Meluan handed me a piece of dark wood the size of a thick book. I took it with both hands.\nThe box was unnaturally heavy for its size, the wood of it smooth as polished stone under my fingers. As I ran my hands over it, I found the sides were carved. Not dramatically enough to attract the attention of the eyes, but so subtly my fingers could barely feel a gentle pattern of risings and fallings in the wood. I brushed my hands over the top and felt a similar pattern.\n\u201cYou were right,\u201d Meluan said softly. \u201cHe\u2019s like a child with a midwinter\u2019s gift.\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen the best of it yet,\u201d Alveron replied. \u201cWait until he starts. The boy has a mind like an iron hammer.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you open it?\u201d I asked. I turned it in my hands and felt something shift inside. There were no obvious hinges or lid, not even a seam where a lid might be. It looked for all the world like a single piece of dark and weighty wood. But I knew it was a box of some sort. It felt like a box. It wanted to be opened.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Meluan said. She might have continued, but her husband hushed her gently.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s inside?\u201d I tilted it again, feeling the contents shift.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d she repeated.\nThe wood itself was interesting. It was dark enough to be roah, but it had a\ndeep red grain. What\u2019s more, it seemed to be a spicewood. It smelled faintly of . . . something.A familiar smell I couldn\u2019t quite put my finger on. I lowered my face to its surface and breathed in deeply through my nose, something almost like lemon. It was maddeningly familiar. \u201cWhat sort of wood is this?\u201d\nTheir silence was answer enough.\nI looked up and met their eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t give a body much to work with, do you?\u201d I smiled to soften any offense the words might bring.\nAlveron sat forward in his chair. \u201cYou must admit,\u201d he said with thinly veiled excitement, \u201cthis is a most excellent question. You\u2019ve shown me your gift at guessing before.\u201d His eyes glittered grey. \u201cSo what can you guess", "about this?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s an heirloom,\u201d I said easily. \u201cVery old\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHow old would you think?\u201d Alveron interjected hungrily.\n\u201cPerhaps three thousand years,\u201d I said. \u201cGive or take.\u201d Meluan stiffened in\nsurprise. \u201cI am close to your own guesses I take it?\u201d\nShe nodded mutely.\n\u201cThe carving has no doubt been eroded over the long years of handling.\u201d \u201cCarving?\u201d Alveron asked, leaning forward in his chair.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very faint,\u201d I said, closing my eyes. \u201cBut I can feel it.\u201d\n\u201cI felt no such thing.\u201d\n\u201cNor I,\u201d said Meluan. She seemed slightly offended.\n\u201cI have exceptionally sensitive hands,\u201d I said honestly. \u201cThey\u2019re necessary\nfor my work.\u201d\n\u201cYour magic?\u201d she asked with a well-hidden hint of childlike awe.\n\u201cAnd music,\u201d I said. \u201cIf you\u2019ll allow me?\u201d She nodded. So I took her hand\nin my own, and pressed it to the top of the box. \u201cThere. Can you feel it?\u201d She furrowed her forehead in concentration. \u201cPerhaps, just a bit.\u201d She took\nher hand away. \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s a carving?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s too regular to be an accident. How can it be you haven\u2019t noticed it\nbefore? Isn\u2019t it mentioned in any of your histories?\u201d\nMeluan was taken aback. \u201cNo one would think of writing down anything\nregarding the Loeclos Box. Haven\u2019t I said this is the most secret of secrets?\u201d \u201cShow me,\u201d Alveron said. I guided his fingers over the pattern. He\nfrowned. \u201cNothing. My fingers must be too old. Could it be letters?\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cIt\u2019s a flowing pattern, like scrollwork. But it doesn\u2019t\nrepeat, it changes . . .\u201d A thought struck me. \u201cIt might be a Yllish story knot.\u201d \u201cCan you read it?\u201d Alveron asked.\nI ran my fingers over it. \u201cI don\u2019t know enough Yllish to read a simple knot\nif I had the string between my fingers.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cBesides, the knots would have changed in the last three thousand years. I know a few people who might be able to translate it at the University.\u201d\nAlveron looked to Meluan, but she shook her head firmly.\u201cI will not have this spoken of to strangers.\u201d\nThe Maer seemed disappointed by this answer, but didn\u2019t press the point. Instead he turned back to me. \u201cLet me ask you your own questions back again. What sort of wood is it?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s lasted three thousand years,\u201d I mused aloud. \u201cIt\u2019s heavy despite being", "hollow. So it has to be a slow wood, like hornbeam or rennel. Its color and weight make me think it has a good deal of metal in it too, like roah. Probably iron and copper.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s the best I can do.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s inside it?\u201d\nI thought for a long moment before saying anything. \u201cSomething smaller than a saltbox. . . .\u201d I began. Meluan smiled, but Alveron gave the barest of frowns so I hurried on. \u201cSomething metal, by the way the weight shifts when I tilt it.\u201d I closed my eyes and listened to the padded thump of its contents moving in the box. \u201cNo. By the weight of it, perhaps something made of glass or stone.\u201d\n\u201cSomething precious,\u201d Alveron said.\nI opened my eyes. \u201cNot necessarily. It has become precious because it is old, and because it has been with a family for so long. It is also precious because it is a mystery. But was it precious to begin with?\u201d I shrugged. \u201cWho can say?\u201d\n\u201cBut you lock up precious things,\u201d Alveron pointed out.\n\u201cPrecisely.\u201d I held up the box, displaying its smooth face. \u201cThis isn\u2019t locked up. In fact, it might be locked away. It may be something dangerous.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d Alveron asked curiously.\n\u201cWhy go through this trouble?\u201d Meluan protested. \u201cWhy save something dangerous? If something is dangerous, you destroy it.\u201d She seemed to answer her own question as soon as she had voiced it. \u201cUnless it was precious as well as dangerous.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps it was too useful to destroy,\u201d Alveron suggested.\n\u201cPerhaps it couldn\u2019t be destroyed,\u201d I said.\n\u201cLast and best,\u201d Alveron said, leaning forward even further in his seat.\n\u201cHow do you open it?\u201d\nI gave the box a long look, turned it in my hands, pressed the sides. I ran\nmy fingers over the patterns, feeling for a seam my eyes could not detect. I shook it gently, tasted the air around it, held it to the light.\n\u201cI have no idea,\u201d I admitted.\nAlveron slumped a little. \u201cIt was too much to expect, I suppose. Perhaps some piece of magic?\u201d\nI hesitated to tell him that sort of magic only existed in stories. \u201cNone I have at my command.\u201d\n\u201cHave you ever considered simply cutting it open?\u201d Alveron asked his wife.", "Meluan looked every bit as horrified as I felt at the suggestion. \u201cNever!\u201d She said as soon as she caught her breath. \u201cIt is the very root of our family. I would sooner think of salting every acre of our lands.\u201d\n\u201cAnd hard as this wood is,\u201d I hurried to say, \u201cyou would most likely ruin whatever was inside. Especially if it is delicate.\u201d\n\u201cIt was only a thought.\u201d Alveron reassured his wife.\n\u201cAn ill-considered one,\u201d Meluan said sharply, then seemed to regret her words. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but the very thought ...\u201d She trailed off, obviously distraught.\nHe patted her hand. \u201cI understand, my dear. You\u2019re right, it was ill- considered.\u201d\n\u201cMight I put it away now?\u201d Meluan asked him.\nI reluctantly handed the box back to Meluan. \u201cIf there were a lock I could attempt to circumvent it, but I can\u2019t even make a guess at where the hinge might be, or the seam for the lid.\u201d In a box, no lid or locks/ Lackless keeps her husband\u2019s rocks. The child\u2019s skipping rhyme ran madly through my head and I only barely managed to turn my laugh into a cough.\nAlveron didn\u2019t seem to notice. \u201cAs always, I trust to your discretion.\u201d He got to his feet. \u201cUnfortunately, I fear I have used up the better portion of our time. I\u2019m certain you have other matters to attend to. Shall we meet tomorrow to discuss the Amyr? Second bell?\u201d\nI had risen to my feet with the Maer. \u201cIf it please your grace, I have another matter that warrants some discussion.\u201d\nHe gave me a serious look. \u201cI trust this is an important matter.\u201d\n\u201cMost urgent, your grace,\u201d I said nervously. \u201cIt should not wait another day. I would have mentioned it sooner, had we both privacy and time.\u201d\n\u201cVery well,\u201d he sat back down. \u201cWhat presses you so direly?\u201d\n\u201cLerand,\u201d Meluan said with slight reproach. \u201cIt is past the hour. Hayanis will be waiting.\u201d\n\u201cLet him wait,\u201d he said. \u201cKvothe has served me well in all regards. He does nothing lightly, and I ignore him only to my detriment.\u201d\n\u201cYou flatter me, your grace. This matter is a grave one.\u201d I glanced at Meluan. \u201cAnd somewhat delicate as well. If your lady desires to leave, it might be for the best.\u201d\n\u201cIf the matter is important, should I not stay?\u201d she asked archly.\nI gave the Maer a questioning look.\n\u201cAnything you wish to say to me you can tell my lady wife,\u201d he said.", "I hesitated. I needed to tell Alveron about the false troupers soon. I was sure if he heard my version of events first, I could present them in a way that cast me in a favorable light. If word came through official channels first he might not be willing to overlook the bald facts of the situation, that I had slaughtered nine travelers of my own free will.\nDespite that, the last thing I wanted was Meluan present for the conversation. It couldn\u2019t help but complicate the situation. I tried one final time. \u201cIt is a matter most dark, your grace.\u201d\nAlveron shook his head, frowning slightly. \u201cWe have no secrets.\u201d\nI fought down a resigned sigh and drew a thick piece of folded parchment from an inner pocket of my shaed. \u201cIs this one of the writs of patronage your grace has granted?\u201d\nHis grey eyes flickered over it, showing some surprise. \u201cYes. How did you come by it?\u201d\n\u201cOh, Lerand,\u201d Meluan said. \u201cI knew you let the beggars travel in your lands, but I never thought you would stoop to patronizing them as well.\u201d\n\u201cOnly a handful of troupes,\u201d he said. \u201cAs befitting my rank. Every respectable household has at least a few players.\u201d\n\u201cMine,\u201d Meluan said firmly, \u201cdoes not.\u201d\n\u201cIt is convenient to have one\u2019s own troupe,\u201d Alveron said gently. \u201cAnd more convenient to have several. Then one can choose the proper entertainment to accompany whatever event you might be hosting. Where do you think the musicians at our wedding came from?\u201d\nWhen Meluan\u2019s expression did not soften, Alveron continued. \u201cThey\u2019re not permitted to perform anything bawdy or heathen, dear. I keep them under most close controlment. And rest assured, no town in my lands would let a troupe perform unless they had a noble\u2019s writ with them.\u201d\nAlveron turned back to me. \u201cWhich brings us back to the matter at hand. How did you come to have their writ? The troupe must be doing poorly without it.\u201d\nI hesitated. With Meluan here, I was unsure as to the best way to approach the subject. I\u2019d planned on speaking to the Maer alone. \u201cThey are, your grace. They were killed.\u201d\nThe Maer showed no surprise. \u201cI thought as much. Such things are unfortunate, but they happen from time to time.\u201d\nMeluan\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cI\u2019d give a great deal to see them happen more often.\u201d", "\u201cHave you any idea who killed them?\u201d the Maer asked. \u201cIn a certain manner of speaking, your grace.\u201d\nHe raised his eyebrows expectantly. \u201cWell then?\u201d\n\u201cI did.\u201d\n\u201cYou did what?\u201d\nI sighed. \u201cI killed the men carrying that writ, your grace.\u201d\nHe stiffened in his seat. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThey had kidnapped a pair of girls from a town they passed through.\u201d I\npaused, looking for a delicate way of saying it in front of Meluan. \u201cThey were young girls, your grace, and the men were not kind to them.\u201d\nMeluan\u2019s expression, already hard, grew cold as ice at this. But before she could speak, Alveron demanded incredulously, \u201cAnd you took it on yourself to kill them? An entire troupe of performers I had given license to?\u201d He rubbed his forehead. \u201cHow many were there?\u201d\n\u201cNine.\u201d\n\u201cGood lord . . .\u201d\n\u201cI think he did right,\u201d Meluan said hotly. \u201cI say you give him a score of\nguards and let him do the same to every ravel band of Ruh he finds within your lands.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear,\u201d Alveron said with a touch of sternness. \u201cI don\u2019t care for them much more than you, but law is law. When . . .\u201d\n\u201cLaw is what you make it,\u201d she interjected. \u201cThis man has done you a noble service. You should grant him fief and title and set him on your council.\u201d\n\u201cHe killed nine of my subjects,\u201d Alveron pointed out sternly. \u201cWhen men step outside the rule of law, anarchy results. If I heard of this in passing, I would hang him for a bandit.\u201d\n\u201cHe killed nine Ruh rapists. Nine murdering ravel thieves. Nine fewer Edema men in the world is a service to us all.\u201d Meluan looked at me. \u201cSir. I think you did nothing but what was right and proper.\u201d\nHer misdirected praise did nothing but fan the fire beneath my temper. \u201cNot all of them were men, my lady,\u201d I said to her.\nMeluan paled a bit at that remark.\nAlveron rubbed his face with a hand. \u201cGood lord, man. Your honesty is like a felling axe.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I should mention,\u201d I said seriously, \u201cbegging both your pardons, that those I killed were not Edema Ruh. They were not even a real troupe.\u201d", "Alveron shook his head tiredly and tapped the writ in front of him. \u201cIt says here otherwise. Edema Ruh and troupers both.\u201d\n\u201cThe writ was stolen goods, your grace. The folk I met on the road had killed a troupe of Ruh and taken up their place.\u201d\nHe gave me a curious look. \u201cYou seem rather certain of it.\u201d\n\u201cOne of them told me so, your grace. He admitted they were merely impersonating a troupe. They were pretending to be Ruh.\u201d\nMeluan looked as if she couldn\u2019t decide whether she was confused or sickened by the thought. \u201cWho would pretend such a thing?\u201d\nAlveron nodded. \u201cMy wife makes a point,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems more likely that they lied to you. Who wouldn\u2019t deny such a thing? Who would willingly admit to being one of the Edema Ruh?\u201d\nI felt myself flush hot at this, suddenly ashamed that I had concealed my Edema Ruh blood for all this time. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt your original troupe were Edema Ruh, your grace. But the men I killed were not. No Ruh would do the things they did.\u201d\nMeluan\u2019s eyes flashed furiously. \u201cYou do not know them.\u201d\nI met her eyes. \u201cMy lady, I think I know them rather well.\u201d\n\u201cBut why?\u201d Alveron asked. \u201cWho in their right mind would try to pass\nthemselves off as Edema Ruh?\u201d\n\u201cFor ease of travel,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd the protection your name offers.\u201d\nHe shrugged my explanation away. \u201cThey were probably Ruh that tired of\nhonest work and took up thieving instead.\u201d\n\u201cNo, your grace,\u201d I insisted. \u201cThey were not Edema Ruh.\u201d Alveron gave me a reproachful look. \u201cCome now. Who can tell the\ndifference between bandits and a band of Ruh?\u201d\n\u201cThere is no difference,\u201d Meluan said crisply.\n\u201cYour grace, I would know the difference,\u201d I said hotly. \u201cI am Edema\nRuh.\u201d\nSilence. Meluan\u2019s expression turned from blank shock, to disbelief, to\nrage, to disgust. She came to her feet, looked for a moment as if she would spit on me, then walked stiffly out the door. There was a clatter as her personal guard came to attention and followed her out of the outer rooms.\nAlveron continued to look at me, his face severe. \u201cIf this is a joke, it is a poor one.\u201d\n\u201cIt is none, your grace,\u201d I said, wrestling with my temper. \u201cAnd why have you found it necessary to hide this from me?\u201d", "\u201cI have not hidden it, your grace. You yourself have mentioned several times that I am far from gentle birth.\u201d\nHe struck the arm of his chair angrily. \u201cYou know what I mean! Why did you never mention that you are one of the Ruh?\u201d\n\u201cI think the reason rather obvious, your grace,\u201d I said stiffly, trying to keep from spitting out the words. \u201cThe words \u2018Edema Ruh\u2019 have too strong a smell for many gentle noses.Your wife has found her perfume cannot cover it.\u201d\n\u201cMy lady has had unfortunate dealings with the Ruh in the past,\u201d he said by way of explanation. \u201cYou would do well to note.\u201d\n\u201cI know of her sister. Her family\u2019s tragic shame. Run off and love a trouper. How terrible,\u201d I said scathingly, my entire body prickling with hot rage. \u201cHer sister\u2019s sense does credit to her family; less so the actions of your lady wife. My blood is worth as much as any man\u2019s, and more than most. And even were it not, she has no leave to treat me as she did.\u201d\nAlveron\u2019s expression hardened. \u201cI rather think that she has leave to treat you as she will,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was simply startled by your sudden proclamation. Given her feelings about you ravel, I think she showed remarkable restraint.\u201d\n\u201cI think she rues the truth. A trouper\u2019s tongue has gotten her to bed more quickly than her sister.\u201d\nAs soon as I said it, I knew I had gone too far. I clenched my teeth to keep from saying anything worse.\n\u201cThat will be all,\u201d Alveron said with cold formality, his eyes flat and angry.\nI left with all the angry dignity I could muster. Not because I had nothing else to say, but because if I had stayed one moment longer he would have called for guards, and that is not how I wished to make my exit.", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY\nJust Rewards\nI WAS IN THE MIDDLE of dressing the following morning when an errand boy arrived bearing a thick envelope with Alveron\u2019s seal. I took a seat by the window and discovered several letters inside. The outermost one read:\nKvothe,\nI have thought a while and decided your blood matters but little in\nlight of the services you have rendered me.\nHowever, my soul is bound to another whose comfort I hold more\ndearly than my own. Though I had hoped to retain your services, I cannot. What\u2019s more, as your presence is the cause of my wife\u2019s considerable distress, I must ask you to return my ring and leave Severen at your earliest convenience.\nI stopped reading, got to my feet, and opened the door to my rooms. A pair of Alveron\u2019s guards were standing at attention in the hallway.\n\u201cSir?\u201d one of them said, eyeing my half-dressed state. \u201cJust checking,\u201d I said, closing the door.\nI returned to my seat and picked up the letter again.\nAs to the matter that precipitated this unfortunate circumstance, I believe you have acted in the best interest of myself and Vintas as a whole. In fact, I have received report just this morning that two girls were returned to their families in Levinshir by a red-haired \u201cgentleman\u201d named Kvothe.\nAs reward for your many services I offer the following:\nFirst, a full pardon for those you killed near Levinshir.\nSecond, a letter of credit enabling you to draw on my coffers for the\npayment of your tuition at the University.\nThird, a writ granting you the right to travel, play, and perform", "wherever you will within my lands. Lastly, my thanks.\nMaershon Lerand Alveron\nI sat for a few long minutes, watching the birds flit in the garden outside my window. The contents of the envelope were just as Alveron had said. The letter of credit was a work of art, signed and sealed in four places by Alveron and his chief exchequer.\nThe writ was, if anything, even more lovely. It was drawn on a thick sheet of creamy vellum, signed by the Maer\u2019s own hand and fixed with both his family\u2019s seal and that of Alveron himself.\nBut it was not a writ of patronage. I read through it carefully. By omission it made it clear that neither was I in the Maer\u2019s service, nor were we bound to each other. Still, it granted free travel and the right to perform under his name. It was an odd compromise of a document.\nI\u2019d just finished dressing when there came another knock on the door. I sighed, half expecting more guards coming to roust me out of my rooms.\nBut opening the door revealed another runner boy. He carried a silver tray bearing another letter. This one had the Lackless seal upon the top. Beside it lay a ring. I picked it up and turned it over in my hands, puzzled. It wasn\u2019t iron, as I\u2019d expected, but pale wood. Meluan\u2019s name was burned crudely into the side of it.\nI noticed the runner boy\u2019s wide eyes darting back and forth between the ring and myself. More importantly, I noticed the guards were not staring at it. Pointedly not staring. The sort of not-staring you only engage in when something very interesting has come to your attention.\nI handed the boy my silver ring. \u201cTake this to Bredon,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t dawdle.\u201d\nBredon was looking up at the guards as I opened the door. \u201cKeep up the good work, my boys,\u201d he said, playfully tapping one of them on the chest with his walking stick. The silver wolf\u2019 s head chimed lightly against the guard\u2019s breastplate, and Bredon smiled like a jolly uncle. \u201cWe all feel safer for your vigilance.\u201d\n \nHe closed the door behind himself and raised an eyebrow at me. \u201cLord\u2019s mercy boy, you\u2019re up the ladder by leaps and bounds. I knew you sat solid in the Maer\u2019s good grace, but to have him assign you two of his personal guard?\u201d He pressed his hand to his heart and sighed dramatically. \u201cSoon you will be too busy for the likes of poor old useless Bredon.\u201d\nI gave him a weak smile. \u201cI think it\u2019s more complicated than that.\u201d I held up the wooden ring for him to see. \u201cI need you to tell me what this means.\u201d\nBredon\u2019s jovial cheer evaporated more quickly than if I\u2019d pulled out a bloody knife. \u201cLord and lady,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me you got that from some oldfashioned farmer.\u201d\nI shook my head and handed it to him.\nHe turned the ring over in his hands. \u201cMeluan?\u201d he asked quietly. Handing it back, he sank into a nearby chair, his walking stick across his knees. His face had gone slightly grey. \u201cThe Maer\u2019s new lady wife sent you this? As a summons?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s about as far from a summons as anything can be,\u201d I said. \u201cShe sent a charming letter, too.\u201d I held it up with my other hand.\nBredon held out his hand. \u201cCan I see it?\u201d he asked, then drew his hand back quickly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s terribly rude of me to ask\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou could do me no greater favor than reading it,\u201d I said, pressing it into his hands. \u201cI am in desperate need of your opinion.\u201d\nBredon took the letter and began to read, his lips moving slightly. His expression grew paler as he made his way down the page.\n\u201cThe lady has a gift for well-turned phrase,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThat cannot be denied,\u201d he said. \u201cShe might as well have written this in blood.\u201d\n\u201cI think she would have liked to,\u201d I said. \u201cBut she would have had to kill herself to fill the second page.\u201d I held it out to him.\nBredon took it and continued to read, his face growing even paler. \u201cGods all around us,\u201d he said. \u201cIs \u2018excrescence\u2019 even a word?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cIt is,\u201d I said.\nBredon finished the second page, then went back to the beginning and slowly read it through a second time. Finally he looked up at me. \u201cIf there were a woman,\u201d he said, \u201cwho loved me with one-tenth the passion this lady feels for you, I would count myself the luckiest of men.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d I asked, holding up the ring. I could smell smoke on it. She must have burned her name into it just this morning.", "\u201cFrom a farmer?\u201d he shrugged. \u201cMany things, depending on the wood. But here? From one of the nobility?\u201d He shook his head, obviously at a loss for words.\n\u201cI thought there were only three types of courtly rings,\u201d I said.\n\u201cOnly three a person would use,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly three that are sent and displayed. It used to be you sent wooden rings to summon servants. Those too low for iron. But that was a long while back. Eventually it became a terrible snub to send someone in the court a wooden ring.\u201d\n\u201cA snub I can live with,\u201d I said, relieved. \u201cI\u2019ve been snubbed by better folk than her.\u201d\n\u201cThat was a hundred years ago,\u201d Bredon said. \u201cThings have changed. The problem was, once the wooden rings were seen as a snub, some servants would be offended by them. You don\u2019t want to offend the master of your stables, so you don\u2019t send him a wooden ring. But if he doesn\u2019t get a wooden ring, then your tailor might be offended by one.\u201d\nI nodded my understanding. \u201cAnd so on. Eventually anyone was offended by a wooden ring.\u201d\nBredon nodded. \u201cA wise man is careful to stay on the good side of his servants,\u201d he said. \u201cEven the boy that brings your dinner can carry a grudge, and there are a thousand invisible revenges available to the lowest of them. Wooden rings aren\u2019t used at all anymore. They probably would have fallen out of memory entirely if they weren\u2019t used as a plot device in a handful of plays.\u201d\nI looked at the ring. \u201cSo I\u2019m lower than the boy who collects the slops.\u201d\nBredon cleared his throat self-consciously. \u201cMore than that, actually.\u201d He pointed. \u201cThat means to her, you aren\u2019t even a person. You aren\u2019t worth recognizing as a human being.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d I said. \u201cI see.\u201d\nI slid the wooden ring onto my finger and made a fist. It was quite a good fit, actually.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the sort of ring you wear,\u201d Bredon said uncomfortably. \u201cIt\u2019s quite the other sort of ring, actually.\u201d He gave me a curious look. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you still have Alveron\u2019s ring?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s asked for it back, actually.\u201d I picked the Maer\u2019s letter off the table and handed it to Bredon as well.\n\u201cAt your earliest convenience,\u201d Bredon quoted with a dry chuckle. \u201cThat says quite a bit more than it seems.\u201d He set the letter down. \u201cStill, it\u2019s", "probably better this way. If he left you with his favor you\u2019d be a battleground for them: a peppercorn between her mortar and his pestle. They would crush you with their bickering.\u201d\nHis eyes flickered back to the wooden ring on my hand. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose she gave it to you personally?\u201d he asked hopefully.\n\u201cShe sent it with a runner.\u201d I let out a low sigh. \u201cThe guards saw it too.\u201d\nThere was a knock on the door. I answered it, and a runner boy handed me a letter.\nI closed the door and looked at the seal. \u201cLord Praevek,\u201d I said.\nBredon shook his head. \u201cI swear that man spends every waking moment with his ear against a keyhole or his tongue up someone\u2019s ass.\u201d\nChuckling, I cracked the letter open and scanned it quickly. \u201cHe\u2019s asking for his ring back,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s smudged too, he didn\u2019t even wait for the ink to dry.\u201d\nBredon nodded. \u201cWord is undoubtedly spreading. It wouldn\u2019t be so bad if she wasn\u2019t sitting strong at Alveron\u2019s right hand. But she is, and she\u2019s made her opinion clear. Anyone who treats you better than a dog will doubtless share the scorn she feels for you.\u201d He fluttered her letter. \u201cAnd scorn such as this, there\u2019s plenty to go around without worry of it spreading thin.\u201d\nBredon gestured to the bowl of rings and gave a dry, mirthless chuckle. \u201cJust when you were getting some silver, too.\u201d\nI walked over to the bowl, dug out his ring, and held it out to him. \u201cYou should take this back,\u201d I said.\nBredon\u2019s expression looked pained, but he made no move to take the ring.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be leaving soon,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d hate for you to be tarnished by your contact with me. There\u2019s no way I can thank you for the help you\u2019ve given me. The least I can do is help minimize the damage to your reputation.\u201d\nBredon hesitated, then closed his eyes and sighed. He took the ring with a defeated shrug.\n\u201cOh,\u201d I said, suddenly remembering something else. I went to the stack of slanderous stories and pulled out the pages that described his pagan frolics. \u201cYou might find this amusing,\u201d I said as I handed it to him. \u201cNow you should probably go. Simply being here can\u2019t be good for you.\u201d\nBredon sighed and nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry it didn\u2019t work out better for you, my boy. If you\u2019re ever back in these parts don\u2019t hesitate to call on me. These things do blow over eventually.\u201d His eyes kept drifting back to the wooden", "ring on my finger. \u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t keep wearing that.\u201d\nAfter he was gone, I fished Stapes\u2019 gold ring out of the bowl and Alveron\u2019s\niron one as well. Then I stepped out into the hallway.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to pay a call on Stapes,\u201d I said politely to the guards. \u201cWould\nthe two of you care to accompany me?\u201d\nThe taller one glanced at the ring on my finger, then looked at his\ncompanion before murmuring an agreement. I turned on my heel and set off, my escort keeping pace behind me.\nStapes ushered me inside his sitting room and closed the door behind me. His rooms were even finer than my own and considerably more lived in. I also saw a large bowl of rings on a nearby table. All of them were gold. The only iron ring in sight was Alveron\u2019s, and that was on his finger.\nHe might look like a grocer, but Stapes had a sharp set of eyes. He spotted the ring on my finger straightaway. \u201cShe did it then,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t wear it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of what I am,\u201d I said. \u201cIf this is the ring of an Edema Ruh, I\u2019ll wear it.\u201d\nStapes sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than that.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d I said.\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to make your life difficult. Could you return this to the Maer for me?\u201d I handed him Alveron\u2019s ring.\nStapes put it in his pocket.\n\u201cI also wanted to return these.\u201d I handed him the two rings he had given me. One bright gold, one white bone. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make trouble between you and your master\u2019s new wife.\u201d\nStapes nodded, holding up the gold ring. \u201cIt would make trouble if you kept it,\u201d he said. \u201cI am in the Maer\u2019s service. As such, I need to be mindful of the games of the court.\u201d\nThen he reached out and took my hand, pressing the bone ring back into it. \u201cBut this lies outside my duty to the Maer. It is a debt between two men. The games of the court have no sway over such things.\u201d Stapes met my eye. \u201cAnd I insist you keep it.\u201d\n  \nI ate a late supper alone in my rooms. The guards were still waiting patiently outside as I read the Maer\u2019s letter for the fifth time. Each time I hoped to find some clement sentiment hidden in his phrasing. But it simply wasn\u2019t there.\nOn the table sat the various papers the Maer had sent. I emptied my purse beside them. I had two gold royals, four silver nobles, eight and a half pennies, and, inexplicably, a single Modegan strelum, though I couldn\u2019t for the life of me remember where I\u2019d come by it.\nAltogether they equaled slightly less than eight talents. I stacked them next to Alveron\u2019s papers. Eight talents, a pardon, a player\u2019s writ, and my tuition paid at the University. It was not an inconsiderable reward.\nStill, I couldn\u2019t help but feel rather shorted. I had saved Alveron from a poisoning, uncovered a traitor in his court, won him a wife, and rid his roads of more dangerous folk than I cared to count.\nDespite all that, I was still left without a patron. Worse, his letter had made no mention of the Amyr, no mention of the support he had promised to lend me in my search for them.\nBut there was nothing to be gained by making a fuss, and much that I could lose. I refilled my purse and tucked Alveron\u2019s letters into the secret compartment in my lute case.\nI also nicked three books I\u2019d brought from Caudicus\u2019 library, since no one knew I had them, and tipped the bowlful of rings into a small sack. The wardrobe held two dozen finely tailored outfits. They were worth a heavy penny, but weren\u2019t very portable. I took two of the nicer outfits and left the rest hanging.\nLastly I belted on Caesura and worked my shaed into a long cape. Those two items reassured me that my time in Vintas had not been entirely wasted, though I\u2019d earned them on my own, not through any help of Alveron\u2019s.\nI locked the door, snuffed the lamps, and climbed out a window into the garden. Then I used a piece of bent wire to lock the window and close the shutters behind me.\nPetty mischief? Perhaps, but I\u2019d be damned if I\u2019d be escorted from the estates by the Maer\u2019s guard. Besides, the thought of them puzzling over my escape made me chuckle, and laughter is good for the digestion.\n \nI made my way out of the estates without anyone seeing me. My shaed was well suited to sneaking about in the dark. After an hour of searching I found a greasy bookbinder in Severen-Low.\nHe was an unsavory fellow with the morals of a feral dog, but he was interested in the stack of slanderous stories the nobility had been sending to my rooms. He offered me four reels for the lot of them, plus the promise of ten pennies for every volume of the book he sold after they were printed. I bargained him up to six reels and six pennies per copy and we shook hands. I left his shop, burned the contract, and washed my hands twice. I did keep the money, however.\nAfter that I sold both suits of fine clothing and all of Caudicus\u2019 books except for one. With the money I\u2019d accumulated, I spent the next several hours on the docks and found a ship leaving the next day for Junpui.\nAs night settled onto the city, I wandered the high parts of Severen, hoping I might run into Denna. I didn\u2019t, of course. I could tell she was long gone. A city feels different when Denna is somewhere inside it, and Severen felt as hollow as an empty egg.\nAt the end of several hours of fruitless searching, I stopped by a dockside brothel and spent some time drinking in the taproom. It was a slow night, and the ladies were bored. So I bought drinks for everyone, and we talked. I told a few stories and they listened. I played a few songs and they applauded. Then I asked a favor, and they laughed and laughed and laughed.\nSo I poured the sackful of rings into a bowl and left them on the bar. Soon the ladies were trying them on and arguing over who would get the silver ones. I bought another round of drinks and left, my mood somewhat improved.\nI wandered aimlessly after that, eventually finding a small public garden near the lip of the Sheer looking out over Severen-Low. The lamps below were burning orange, while here or there a gaslight or sympathy lamp flickered greenish blue and crimson. It was as breathtaking as the first time I had seen it.\nI had been watching for some time before I realized I wasn\u2019t alone. An older man leaned against a tree several feet away, looking down at the lights much as I had been. A faint and not unpleasant aroma of beer wafted from him.", "\u201cShe\u2019s a pretty thing, innit she?\u201d he said, his accent marking him as a dockworker.\nI agreed. We watched the twinkling fires silently for a time. I unscrewed the wooden ring from my finger and considered throwing it off the cliff. Now that someone was watching, I couldn\u2019t help but feel the gesture was somewhat childish.\n\u201cThey say a nobleman can piss on half o\u2019 Severen from up here,\u201d the dockman said conversationally.\nI tucked the ring into a pocket of my shaed. A memento then. \u201cThose are the lazy ones,\u201d I replied. \u201cThe ones I\u2019ve met can piss a lot farther than that.\u201d", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-ONE\nA Journey to Return\nFATE FAVORED ME ON the way back to the University. We had a good wind and everything was delightfully uneventful. The sailors had heard of my encounter with Felurian, so I enjoyed a modest fame for the duration of the trip. I played them the song I\u2019d written about it, and told them the story about half as often as they asked me to.\nI also told them about my trip to the Adem. They didn\u2019t believe a piece of it at first, but then I showed them the sword and threw their best wrestler three times. They showed me a different sort of respect after that, and a rougher, more honest sort of friendship.\nI learned a goodly bit from them on my journey home. They told me sea stories and the names of stars. They talked about wind and water and wimmin, sorry, women. They tried to teach me sailor\u2019s knots, but I didn\u2019t have a knack for it, though I proved to be a dab hand at untying them.\nAltogether it was very pleasant. The friendship of the sailors, the song of the wind in the rigging, the smell of sweat and salt and tar. Over the long days, these things slowly eased the bitterness I felt toward my ill treatment at the hands of Maer Alveron and his loving lady wife.", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-TWO\nHome\nEVENTUALLY WE DOCKED IN Tarbean, where the sailors helped me find a cheap berth on a billow boat heading upstream toward Anilin. I got off two days later in Imre and walked to the University just as the first blue light of dawn was coloring the sky.\nI\u2019ve never in my life had anything like a home. As a young child I grew up on the road, endlessly traveling with my troupe. Home wasn\u2019t a place. It was people and wagons. Later in Tarbean I had had a secret place where three roofs came together and gave me shelter from the rain. I slept there and hid a few precious things, but it wasn\u2019t anything like a home.\nBecause of this, I\u2019d never in my life enjoyed the feeling of coming home after a journey. I felt it for the first time that day as I crossed the Omethi, the stones of the bridge familiar underneath my feet. As I came to the tallest part of its broad arch I could see the grey shape of the Archives rising out of the trees ahead of me.\nThe streets of the University were comforting under my feet. I\u2019d been gone for three-quarters of a year. In some ways it seemed much longer, but at the same time everything here felt so familiar that it felt like hardly any time at all had passed.\nIt was still early when I got to Anker\u2019s, and the front door was locked. I briefly considered climbing up to my window, then thought better of it, given that I was carrying my lute case and travelsack, and wearing Caesura as well.\nInstead I made my way to the Mews and knocked on Simmon\u2019s door. It was early, and I knew I\u2019d be waking him, but I was hungry for a familiar face. After waiting a short minute and hearing nothing, I knocked again, louder, and practiced my best jaunty smile.\nSim opened the door, his hair in disarray, his eyes red from too little sleep. He looked blearily out at me. For the space of a breath his expression was blank, then he hurled himself at me with a crushing hug.\n\u201cBlackened body of God,\u201d he said, using stronger language than I\u2019d ever", "heard from him before. \u201cKvothe.You\u2019re alive.\u201d\nSim had a bit of a cry, then shouted at me for a while, and then we laughed and sorted matters out. It seems Threpe had been keeping closer tabs on my travels than I\u2019d thought. Consequently, when my ship had gone missing, he\u2019d assumed the worst.\nA letter would have cleared things up, but I\u2019d never thought to send one. The thought of writing home was utterly alien to me.\n\u201cThe ship was reported as all hands lost,\u201d Sim said. \u201cWord spread around the Eolian and guess who heard the news.\u201d\n\u201cStanchion?\u201d I asked, knowing he was a terrible gossip.\nSim shook his head grimly. \u201cAmbrose.\u201d\n\u201cOh lovely,\u201d I observed dryly.\n\u201cIt would have been bad coming from anyone,\u201d Sim said. \u201cBut it was\nworst from him. I was half convinced he\u2019d somehow arranged to sink your ship.\u201d He gave a sickly smile. \u201cHe waited until right before admissions before he broke the news to me. Needless to say, I pissed all over myself during my exam and spent another term as an E\u2019lir.\u201d\n\u201cSpent?\u201d I said. \u201cYou made Re\u2019lar?\u201d\nHe grinned. \u201cJust yesterday. I was sleeping off the celebration when you woke me up this morning.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019s Wil?\u201d I asked. \u201cDid he take the news hard?\u201d\n\u201cEven-keeled as always,\u201d Sim said. \u201cBut for all that, yeah, pretty hard.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cAmbrose has been making his life difficult in the Archives, too. Wil got fed up with it and went home for a term. He should be back today.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019s everyone else?\u201d I asked.\nA thought seemed to strike Sim all of a sudden. He stood up. \u201cOh God, Fela!\u201d Then he sat down hard, as if his legs had been cut from underneath him. \u201cOh God, Fela,\u201d he said in a completely different tone.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked. \u201cDid something happen to her?\u201d\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t take the news well either.\u201d He gave me a shaky smile. \u201cIt turns out she had quite a thing for you.\u201d\n\u201cFela?\u201d I said stupidly.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you remember? Wil and I thought she liked you?\u201d\n \nIt seemed like years ago. \u201cI remember.\u201d\nSim seemed uncomfortable. \u201cWell, you see. While you were gone, Wil and I started spending a lot of time with her. And . . .\u201d He made an inarticulate gesture, his expression was stuck between sheepish and grinning.\nRealization struck. \u201cYou and Fela? Sim, that\u2019s great!\u201d I felt a grin spread across my face, then saw his expression. \u201cOh.\u201d My grin fell away. \u201cSim, I wouldn\u2019t get in the way of that.\u201d\n\u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d He smiled a sickly smile. \u201cI trust you.\u201d\nI rubbed my eyes. \u201cThis is a hell of a homecoming. I haven\u2019t even been through admissions yet.\u201d\n\u201cToday\u2019s the last day,\u201d Sim pointed out.\n\u201cI know,\u201d I said, getting to my feet. \u201cI have an errand to run first.\u201d\nI left my baggage in Simmon\u2019s room and paid a visit to the bursar in the basement of Hollows. Riem was a balding, pinch-faced man who had disliked me ever since the masters had assigned me a negative tuition in my first term. He wasn\u2019t in the habit of giving money out, and the entire experience had rubbed him the wrong way.\nI showed him my open letter of credit to Alveron\u2019s coffers. As I\u2019ve said, it was an impressive document. Signed by the Maer\u2019s own hand. Wax seals. Fine vellum. Excellent penmanship.\nI drew the bursar\u2019s attention to the fact that the Maer\u2019s letter would allow the University to draw any amount needed to cover my tuition. Any amount.\nThe bursar read it over and agreed that that seemed to be the case.\nIt\u2019s too bad my tuition was always so low, I mused aloud. Never more than ten talents. It was a bit of a missed opportunity for the University. The Maer was richer than the King of Vint, after all. And he would pay any tuition. . . .\nRiem was a savvy man, and he understood what I was hinting at immediately. There followed a brief bout of negotiation, after which we shook hands and I saw him smile for the first time.\nI grabbed a bite of lunch, then waited in line with the rest of the students who didn\u2019t have admissions tiles. Most of them were new students, but a few were applying for readmission like myself. It was a long line, and everyone was visibly nervous to some degree. I whistled to pass the time and bought a\n \nmeat pie and a mug of hot cider from a man with a cart.\nI caused a bit of a stir when I stepped into the circle of light in front of the\nmasters\u2019 table. They had heard the news and were surprised to see me alive, most of them pleasantly so. Kilvin demanded I report to the workshop soon, while Mandrag, Dal, and Arwyl argued over which courses of study I would pursue. Elodin merely waved at me, the only one apparently unimpressed by my miraculous return from the dead.\nAfter a minute of congenial chaos, the Chancellor got things back under control and started my interview. I answered Dal\u2019s questions easily enough, and Kilvin\u2019s. But I fumbled my cipher with Brandeur, then had to admit I simply didn\u2019t know the answer to Mandrag\u2019s question about sublimation.\nElodin shrugged away his opportunity to question me, yawning hugely. Lorren asked a surprisingly easy question about the Mender heresies, and I managed a quick and clever answer for him. I had to think for a long moment before answering Arwyl\u2019s question about lacillium.\nThat left only Hemme, who had been scowling furiously since I\u2019d first stepped up to the masters\u2019 table. My lackluster performance and slow answers had brought a smug curve to his lips by this point. His eyes gleamed whenever I gave a wrong answer.\n\u201cWell well,\u201d he said, shuffling through the sheaf of papers in front of him. \u201cI didn\u2019t think we\u2019d have to deal with your type of trouble again.\u201d He gave me an insincere smile. \u201cI\u2019d heard you were dead.\u201d\n\u201cI heard you wear a red lace corset,\u201d I said matter-of-factly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t believe every bit of nonsense that gets rumored about.\u201d\nSome shouting followed, and I was quickly brought up on charges of Improper Address of a Master. I was sentenced to compose a letter of apology and fined a single silver talent. Money well spent.\nIt was bad behavior though, and poorly timed, especially after my otherwise lackluster performance. As a result, I was assigned a tuition of twenty-four talents. Needless to say, I was terribly embarrassed.\nAfterward I returned to the bursar\u2019s office. I officially presented Alveron\u2019s letter of credit to Riem and unofficially collected my agreed-upon cut: half of everything over ten talents. I put the seven talents in my purse and wondered idly if anyone had ever been paid so well for insolence and ignorance.\nI headed to Anker\u2019s, where I was pleased to discover no one had informed the owner of my death. The key to my room was somewhere at the bottom of the Centhe Sea, but Anker had a spare. I went upstairs and felt myself relax at", "the familiar sight of the sloping ceiling and narrow bed. Everything was covered in a thin layer of dust.\nYou might think my tiny room with its sloped ceiling and narrow bed would feel cramped after my grand suite in Alveron\u2019s estate. But nothing could be further from the truth. I busied myself unpacking my travelsack and getting cobwebs out of corners.\nAfter an hour, I\u2019d managed to pick the lock on the trunk at the foot of my bed and unpack the things I\u2019d stored away. I rediscovered my half-dismantled harmony clock and tinkered with it idly, trying to remember whether I\u2019d been in the middle of taking it apart or putting it back together.\nThen, since I had no other pressing engagements, I made my way back across the river. I stopped at the Eolian, where Deoch greeted me with an enthusiastic bear hug that lifted me from the ground. After so long on the road, so much time spent among strangers and enemies, I\u2019d forgotten what it was like to be surrounded by the warmth of friendly faces. Deoch, Stanchion, and I shared drinks and traded stories until it started to get dark outside, and I left them to tend to their business.\nI prowled the city for a while, going to a few familiar boarding houses and taverns. Two or three public gardens. A bench beneath a tree in a courtyard. Deoch told me he hadn\u2019t so much as glimpsed Denna\u2019s shadow in a year. But even looking for her and not finding her was comforting in a way. In some ways that seemed to be the heart of our relationship.\nLater that night I climbed onto Mains and made my way through the familiar maze of chimneys and mismatched slate and clay and tin. I came around a corner and saw Auri sitting on a chimney, her long, fine hair floating around her head as if she were underwater. She was staring up at the moon and swinging her bare feet.\nI cleared my throat softly, and Auri turned to look. She hopped off the chimney and came scampering across the roof, pulling up a few steps short of me. Her grin was brighter than the moon. \u201cThere is a whole family of hedgehogs living in Cricklet!\u201d she said excitedly.\nAuri took two more steps and grabbed my hand with both of hers. \u201cThere are babies tiny as acorns!\u201d She tugged at me gently. \u201cWill you come see?\u201d\n \nI nodded, and Auri led me across the roof to the apple tree we could use to climb down into the courtyard. When we finally got there, she looked at the tree, then down to where she still held my long, tan hand with both of her tiny white ones. Her grip wasn\u2019t tight, but it was firm, and she didn\u2019t give any sign of letting go.\n\u201cI missed you,\u201d she said softly without looking up. \u201cDon\u2019t go away again.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t ever plan on leaving,\u201d I said gently. \u201cI have too much to do here.\u201d Auri tilted her head sideways to peek up at me through the cloud of her\nhair. \u201cLike visit me?\u201d\n\u201cLike visit you,\u201d I agreed.", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-THREE\nBloodless\nTHERE WAS ONE FINAL surprise waiting for me on my return to the University.\nI\u2019d been back for a handful of days before I returned to my work in the Fishery. While I was no longer in desperate need of money, I missed the work. There is something deeply satisfying in shaping something with your hands. Proper artificing is like a song made solid. It is an act of creation.\nSo I went to Stocks, thinking to start with something simple, as I was out of practice. As I approached the window, I saw a familiar face. \u201cHello Basil,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat did you do to get stuck here this time?\u201d\nHe looked down. \u201cImproper handling of reagents,\u201d he muttered.\nI laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s not so bad. You\u2019ll be out in a span or so.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d He looked up and gave a shamefaced grin. \u201cI heard you were\nback. You come for your credit?\u201d\nI stopped halfway through my mental list of everything I\u2019d need to make a\nheat funnel. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\nBasil cocked his head to the side. \u201cYour credit,\u201d he repeated. \u201cFor the\nBloodless.\u201d He looked at me for a moment, then realization dawned on his face. \u201cThat\u2019s right, you wouldn\u2019t know. . . .\u201d He stepped away from the window for a moment, and returned with something that looked like an eightsided lamp made entirely of iron.\nIt was different than the arrowcatch I\u2019d made. The one I\u2019d constructed was built from scratch and rather rough around the edges. This one was smooth and sleek. All the pieces fit together snugly, and it was covered in a thin layer of clear alchemical enamel that would protect it from rain and rust. Clever, I should have included that in my original design.\nWhile part of me was flattered that someone had liked my design enough to copy it, a larger part of me was irritated to see an arrowcatch so much more polished than my original. I noticed a telltale uniformity in the pieces. \u201cSomeone made a set of moldings?\u201d I asked.", "Basil nodded. \u201cOh yes. Ages ago. Two sets.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve got to say, it\u2019s clever stuff. Took me a long while to get my head around how the inertial trigger worked, but now that I\u2019ve got it. . .\u201d He tapped his forehead. \u201cI\u2019ve made two myself. Good money for the time they take. Beats the hell out of deck lamps.\u201d\nThat wrung a smile out of me. \u201cAnything is better than deck lamps,\u201d I agreed, picking it up. \u201cIs this one of yours?\u201d\nHe shook his head. \u201cMine sold a month back. They don\u2019t sit long. Clever of you to price them so low.\u201d\nI turned it over in my hands and saw a word grooved into the metal. The blocky letters went deep into the iron, so I knew they were part of the mold. They read, \u201cBloodless.\u201d\nI looked up at Basil. He smiled. \u201cYou took off without giving it a proper name,\u201d he said. \u201cThen Kilvin formalized the schema and added it to the records. We needed to call it something before we started to sell it.\u201d His smile faded a bit. \u201cBut that was around the same time word came back you\u2019d been lost at sea. So Kilvin brought in Master Elodin. . . .\u201d\n\u201cTo give it a proper name,\u201d I said, still turning it in my hands. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u201cKilvin grumbled a bit,\u201d Basil said. \u201cCalled it dramatic nonsense. But it stuck.\u201d He shrugged and ducked down and rummaged a bit before bringing up a book. \u201cAnyway, you want your credit?\u201d He started flipping pages. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a chunk of it built up by now. Lot of folk have been making them.\u201d\nHe found the page he wanted and ran his finger along the ledger line. \u201cThere we are. Sold twenty-eight so far . . .\u201d\n\u201cBasil,\u201d I said. \u201cI really don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re talking about. Kilvin already paid me for the first one I made.\u201d\nBasil furrowed his brow. \u201cYour commission,\u201d he said matter-of-factly. Then, seeing my blank look, he continued. \u201cEvery time Stocks sells something, the Fishery gets a thirty percent commission and whoever owns the schema gets ten percent.\u201d\n\u201cI thought Stocks kept the whole forty,\u201d I said, shocked.\nHe lifted one shoulder in a shrug. \u201cMost times it does. Stocks owns most of the old schemas. Most things have already been invented. But for something new . . .\u201d\n\u201cManet never mentioned that,\u201d I said.\nBasil gave an apologetic grimace. \u201cOld Manet is a workhorse,\u201d he said", "politely. \u201cBut he\u2019s not the most innovative fellow around. He\u2019s been here, what, thirty years? I don\u2019t think he has a single schema to his name.\u201d He flipped through the book a bit, scanning the pages. \u201cMost serious artificers have at least one just as a point of pride, even if it\u2019s something fairly useless.\u201d\nNumbers spun in my head. \u201cSo ten percent of eight talents each,\u201d I murmured, then looked up. \u201cI\u2019ve got twenty-two talents waiting for me?\u201d\nBasil nodded, looking at the entry in the book. \u201cTwenty-two and four,\u201d he said, bringing out a pencil and a piece of paper. \u201cYou want all of it?\u201d\nI grinned.\nWhen I set out for Imre my purse was so heavy I feared I might develop a limp. I stopped by Anker\u2019s and picked up my travelsack, resting it on my opposite shoulder to balance things out.\nI wandered through town, idly passing by all the places Denna and I had frequented in the past. I wondered where in the world she might be.\nAfter my ritual search was complete, I made my way to a back alley that smelled of rancid fat and climbed a set of narrow stairs. I knocked briskly on Devi\u2019s door, waited for a long minute, then knocked again, louder.\nThere was the sound of a bolt being thrown and a lock turning. The door cracked open and a single pale blue eye peered out at me. I grinned.\nThe door swung open slowly. Devi stood in the doorway, staring blankly at me, her arms at her sides.\nI raised an eyebrow at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d I said. \u201cNo witty banter?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t do business on the landing,\u201d she said automatically. Her voice was absolutely without inflection. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to come inside.\u201d\nI waited, but she didn\u2019t step out of the doorway. I could smell cinnamon and honey wafting out from the room behind her.\n\u201cDevi?\u201d I asked. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a . . .\u201d She trailed off, still staring at me. Her voice was flat and emotionless. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be dead.\u201d\n\u201cIn this and many other things, I aim to disappoint,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI was sure he\u2019d done it,\u201d Devi continued. \u201cHis father\u2019s barony is called the Pirate Isles. I was sure he\u2019d done it because we\u2019d set fire to his rooms. I was the one that actually set the fire, but he couldn\u2019t know that. You were the\n \nonly one he saw. You and that Cealdish fellow.\u201d\nDevi looked up at me, blinking in the light. The pixie-faced gaelet had\nalways been fair-skinned, but this was the first time I\u2019d ever seen her look pale. \u201cYou\u2019re taller,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d almost forgotten how tall you are.\u201d\n\u201cI almost forgot how pretty you are,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t quite manage it.\u201d\nDevi continued to stand in the doorway, pale and staring. Concerned, I stepped forward and laid my hand lightly on her arm. She didn\u2019t pull away as I half-expected. She simply looked down at my hand.\n\u201cI\u2019m waiting for a quip here,\u201d I teased gently. \u201cYou\u2019re usually quicker than this.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can match wits with you right now,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI never suspected you could match wits with me,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I do like a little banter now and then.\u201d\nDevi gave a ghost of a smile, a little color coming back to her cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019re a horse\u2019s ass,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s more like it,\u201d I said encouragingly as I drew her out of the doorway into the bright autumn afternoon. \u201cI knew you had it in you.\u201d\nThe two of us walked to a nearby inn, and with the help of a short beer and long lunch, Devi recovered from the shock of seeing me alive. Soon she was her usual sharp-tongued self again, and we bantered back and forth over mugs of spiced cider.\nAfterward we strolled back to her rooms behind the butcher shop, where Devi discovered she\u2019d forgotten to lock her door.\n\u201cMerciful Tehlu,\u201d she said, once we were inside, looking around frantically. \u201cThat\u2019s a first.\u201d\nLooking around, I saw that little had changed in her rooms since I\u2019d last seen them, though her second set of bookshelves was almost half full. I looked over the titles as Devi searched the other rooms to make sure nothing was missing.\n\u201cAnything you\u2019d like to borrow?\u201d she asked, as she came back into the room.\n\u201cActually,\u201d I said, \u201cI have something for you.\u201d\n \nI set my travelsack on her desk and rooted around until I found a flat rectangular package wrapped in oilskin and tied with twine. I moved my travelsack onto the floor and put the package on the desk, nudging it toward her.\nDevi approached the desk wearing a dubious expression, then sat down and unwrapped the parcel. Inside was the copy of Celum Tinture I\u2019d stolen from Caudicus\u2019 library. Not a particularly rare book, but a useful resource for an alchemist exiled from the Archives. Not that I knew anything about alchemy, of course.\nDevi looked down at it. \u201cAnd what\u2019s this for?\u201d she asked.\nI laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s a present.\u201d\nShe eyed me narrowly. \u201cIf you think this will get you an extension on your\nloan. . . .\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cI just thought you\u2019d like it,\u201d I said. \u201cAs for the loan . . .\u201d\nI brought out my purse and counted nine thick talents onto her desk. \u201cWell then,\u201d Devi said, mildly surprised. \u201cIt looks like someone had a\nprofitable trip.\u201d She looked up at me. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to wait until after you\u2019ve paid tuition?\u201d\n\u201cAlready taken care of,\u201d I said.\nDevi made no move to take the money. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to leave you penniless at the start of the new term,\u201d she said.\nI hefted my purse in one hand. It clinked with a delightful fullness that was almost musical.\nDevi brought out a key and unlocked a drawer at the bottom of her desk. One by one she brought out my copy of Rhetoric and Logic, my talent pipes, my sympathy lamp, and Denna\u2019s ring.\nShe piled them neatly on her desk, but still didn\u2019t reach for the coins. \u201cYou still have two months before your year and a day is up,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you sure you wouldn\u2019t prefer to wait?\u201d\nPuzzled, I looked down at the money on the table, then around at Devi\u2019s rooms. Realization came to me like a flower unfurling in my head. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about the money at all, is it?\u201d I said, amazed it had taken me this long to figure it out.\nDevi cocked her head to the side.\nI gestured at the bookshelves, the large velvet-curtained bed, at Devi herself. I\u2019d never noticed before, but while her clothes weren\u2019t fancy, the cut and cloth were fine as any noble\u2019s.", "\u201cThis doesn\u2019t have anything to do with money,\u201d I repeated. I looked at her books. Her collection had to be worth five hundred talents if it was worth a penny. \u201cYou use the money as bait. You lend it out to desperate folks who might be useful to you, then hope they can\u2019t pay you back. Your real business is favors.\u201d\nDevi chuckled a bit. \u201cMoney is nice,\u201d she said, her eyes glittering. \u201cBut the world is full of things that people would never sell. Favors and obligation are worth far, far more.\u201d\nI looked down at the nine talents gleaming on her desk. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a minimum loan amount, do you?\u201d I asked, already knowing the answer. \u201cYou just told me that so I\u2019d be forced to borrow more. You were hoping I\u2019d dig myself a hole too deep and not be able to pay you back.\u201d\nDevi smiled brightly. \u201cWelcome to the game,\u201d she said as she began to pick up the coins. \u201cThanks for playing.\u201d", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-FOUR\nSword and Shaed\nWITH MY PURSE FULL to bursting and Alveron\u2019s letter of credit assuring my tuition, my winter term was carefree as a walk in the garden.\nIt was strange not having to live like a miser. I had clothes that fit me and could afford to have them laundered. I could have coffee or chocolate whenever I wanted. I no longer needed to toil endlessly in the Fishery and could spend time tinkering simply to satisfy my curiosity or pursue projects simply for the joy of it.\nAfter almost a year away, it took me a while to settle back into the University. It felt odd not wearing a sword after all this time. But such things were frowned on here, and I knew it would cause more trouble than it was worth.\nAt first I left Caesura in my rooms. But I knew better than anyone how easy it would be to break in and steal it. The drop bar would only keep away a very genteel thief. A more pragmatic one could simply break my window and be gone in less than a minute. Since the sword was quite literally irreplaceable, and I\u2019d made promises to keep it safe, it wasn\u2019t long before I moved it to a hiding place in the Underthing.\nMy shaed was easier to keep at hand, as I was able to change its shape with a little work. These days it only rarely billowed on its own. More commonly it refused to move as much as the gusting wind seemed to demand. You\u2019d think people would notice such things, but they didn\u2019t. Even Wilem and Simmon, who teased me about my fondness for it, never marked my cloak as anything more than an exceptionally versatile piece of clothing.\nIn fact, Elodin was the only one to notice anything out of the ordinary about it. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he exclaimed when we crossed paths in a small courtyard outside Mains. \u201cHow did you come to be enshaedn?\u201d\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cYour cloak, boy. Your turning cape. How in God\u2019s sweet grace did you tumble onto a shaed?\u201d He mistook my surprise for ignorance. \u201cDon\u2019t you", "know what you\u2019re wearing?\u201d\n\u201cI know what it is,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m just surprised that you do.\u201d\nHe gave me an insulted look. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be much of a namer if I couldn\u2019t\nspot a faerie cloak a dozen feet away.\u201d He took a corner of it between his fingers. \u201cOh, that\u2019s just lovely. Here\u2019s a piece of old magic man rarely lays a finger on.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s new magic, actually,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked.\nWhen it became obvious my explanation involved a long story, Elodin led\nus into a small, cozy pub I\u2019d never seen before. I hesitate to call it a pub at all, actually. It wasn\u2019t full of chattering students and the smell of beer. It was dim and quiet with a low ceiling and scattered clusters of deep, comfortable chairs. It smelled of leather and old wine.\nWe sat near a warm radiator and sipped mulled cider while I told him the whole story of my unintentional trip into the Fae. It was a wonderful relief. I hadn\u2019t been able to tell anyone yet for fear of being laughed out of the University.\nElodin proved to be a surprisingly attentive audience and was especially interested in the fight Felurian and I had had when she had tried to bend me to her will. After I\u2019d finished the story, he peppered me with questions. Could I remember what I\u2019d said to call the wind? How had it felt? The strange wakefulness I described, was it more like being drunk, or more like going into shock?\nI answered as best I could, and eventually he leaned back in his chair, nodding to himself. \u201cIt\u2019s a good sign when a student goes chasing the wind and catches it,\u201d he said approvingly. \u201cThat\u2019s twice you\u2019ve called it now. It can only get easier.\u201d\n\u201cThree times, actually,\u201d I said. \u201cI found it again when I was off in Ademre.\u201d\nHe laughed. \u201cYou chased it to the edge of the map!\u201d he said, making a broad motion with his splayed left hand. Stunned, I realized it was Adem hand-talk for amazed respect. \u201cHow did it feel? Do you think you could find its name again if you had need of it?\u201d\nI concentrated, trying to nudge my mind into Spinning Leaf. It had been a month and a thousand miles since I\u2019d tried, and it was hard to tip my mind into that strange, tumbling emptiness.\nEventually I managed it. I looked around the small room, hoping to see the", "name of the wind like a familiar friend. But there was nothing there except dust motes swirling in a beam of sunlight that slanted through a window.\n\u201cWell?\u201d Elodin asked. \u201cCould you call it if you needed to?\u201d\nI hesitated. \u201cMaybe.\u201d\nElodin nodded as if he understood. \u201cBut probably not if someone were to\nask you to?\u201d\nI nodded, more than a little disappointed.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be discouraged. It will give us something to work toward.\u201d He\ngrinned happily and clapped me on the back. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s more to your story than you realize. You called more than the wind. From what you\u2019ve said, I believe you called Felurian\u2019s name itself.\u201d\nI thought back. My memories of my time in the Fae were oddly patchy, none more than my confrontation with Felurian, which had an odd, almost dreamlike quality to it. When I tried to remember it in detail, it almost seemed as if it had happened to another person. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than possible,\u201d he assured me. \u201cI doubt a creature as old and powerful as Felurian could be subdued with nothing more than wind. Not to belittle your accomplishment,\u201d he hurried to add. \u201cCalling the wind is more than one student in a thousand ever manages. But calling the name of a living thing, let alone one of the Fae . . .\u201d He raised his eyebrows at me. \u201cThat\u2019s a horse of a different color.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would a person\u2019s name be so much different?\u201d I asked, then answered my own question. \u201cThe complexity.\u201d\n\u201cExactly,\u201d he said. My understanding seemed to excite him. \u201cTo name a thing you must understand it entire. A stone or a piece of wind is difficult enough. A person . . .\u201d He trailed off significantly.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t claim to understand Felurian,\u201d I said.\n\u201cSome part of you did,\u201d he insisted. \u201cYour sleeping mind. A rare thing indeed. If you\u2019d known how difficult it was, you never would have stood a chance of doing it.\u201d\nSince poverty no longer forced me to work endless hours in the Fishery, I was free to study more broadly than ever before. I continued my usual classes in sympathy, medicine, and artificing, then added chemistry, herbology, and\n \ncomparative female anatomy.\nMy curiosity had been pricked by my encounter with the Lockless box, and\nI attempted to learn something about Yllish story knots. But I quickly discovered most books on Yll were historical, not linguistic, and gave no information as to how I might actually read a knot.\nSo I scoured the Dead Ledgers and discovered a single shelf of disused books concerning Yll in one of the unpleasant, low-ceilinged sections of the lower basements. Then, while looking for a place to sit and read, I discovered a small room tucked behind a piece of jutting shelving.\nIt wasn\u2019t a reading hole as I suspected. Inside were hundreds of large wooden spools wound about with knotted string. They weren\u2019t books, precisely, but they were the Yllish equivalent. A thin layer of dust covered everything, and I doubted anyone had been in the room for decades.\nI have a vast weakness for secret things. But I quickly found that reading the knots was impossible without first understanding Yllish. There were no classes on the subject, and asking around revealed none of Master Linguist\u2019s gillers knew more than a scattering of words.\nI wasn\u2019t terribly surprised, considering Yll had been nearly ground to dust under the iron boots of the Aturan Empire. The piece that remained today was populated mostly by sheep. And if you stood in the middle of the country, you could throw a stone across the border. Still, it was a disappointing end to my search.\nThen, several days later, Master Linguist summoned me to his office. He\u2019d heard that I\u2019d been making inquiries, and he happened to speak Yllish rather well. He offered to tutor me personally, and I gladly took him up on his offer.\nSince I\u2019d come to the University, I\u2019d only seen Master Linguist during admissions interviews and when I was brought up on the horns for disciplinary reasons. Acting as Chancellor, he was rather grim and formal. But when he wasn\u2019t sitting in the Chancellor\u2019s chair, Master Herma was a surprisingly deft and gentle teacher. He was witty with a surprisingly irreverent sense of humor. The first time he told me a dirty joke, you could have knocked me over with a feather.\nElodin wasn\u2019t teaching a class this term, but I began to study naming privately under his direction. It went more smoothly now that I understood there was a method to his madness.\nCount Threpe was overjoyed to find me alive and threw a resurrection party where I was proudly displayed to the local nobility. I had a suit of", "clothes tailored specifically for the event, and in a fit of nostalgia I chose to have them done in the colors my old troupe had worn: the green and grey of Lord Greyfallow\u2019s men.\nAfter the party, over a bottle of wine in his sitting room, I told Threpe of my adventures. I left off the story of Felurian, as I knew he wouldn\u2019t believe it. And I couldn\u2019t tell him half of what I\u2019d done in the Maer\u2019s service. Consequently, Threpe thought Alveron had been quite generous in rewarding me. I didn\u2019t argue the point.", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-FIVE\nStories\nAMBROSE HAD BEEN BLESSEDLY absent during the winter term, but when spring arrived he came back to roost like some sort of hateful, migratory bird. By no coincidence, the day after he returned, I skipped all my classes and spent the entire day making myself a new gram.\nAs soon as the snow melted and the ground grew firm again, I resumed my practice of the Ketan. Remembering how odd it had looked when I\u2019d first seen it, I did this in the privacy of the forest north of the University.\nWith spring term came a new round of admissions. I showed up for my interview with a profound hangover and fumbled a few questions. My tuition was set at eighteen talents and five, earning me four talents and change from the Bursar.\nSales of the Bloodless had slackened over the winter, as there were fewer merchants visiting the University. But once snows melted and roads grew dry, the handful that had accumulated in the Stocks sold quickly, bringing me another six talents.\nI was unused to having so much money at my disposal, and I\u2019ll admit I went a little mad with it. I owned six suits of clothes that fit me and had all the paper I could use. I bought fine, dark ink from Arueh and purchased my own set of engraving tools. I had two pairs of shoes. Two.\nI found an ancient, ragged Yllish dictum buried in a bookstore in Imre. Full of drawings of knots, the bookstore owner thought it was a sailor\u2019s journal and I bought it for a mere talent and a half. Not long after I bought a copy of The Heroborica, then added a copy of Termigus Techina I could use as a reference while designing schema in the privacy of my own room.\nI bought dinner for my friends. Auri had new dresses and bright ribbons for her hair. All this and still money in my purse. How odd. How wonderful.\n \nToward the middle of the term I began to hear familiar stories. Stories about a certain red-haired adventurer who had spent the night with Felurian. Stories of a dashing young arcanist with all the powers of Taborlin the Great. It had taken months, but my exploits in Vintas had finally passed their way from mouth to ear all the long miles back to the University.\nIt may be true that when I finally became aware of these stories I lengthened my shaed a bit and wore it more often than before. It might also be the case that I spent a shameful amount of time in alehouses over the next several span, lurking quietly, listening to stories. I might even have gone so far as to offer a suggestion or two.\nI was young, after all, and it was only natural for me to delight in my notoriety. I thought it would fade in time. Why shouldn\u2019t I revel a bit in the sidelong glances my fellow students made? Why not enjoy it while it lasted?\nMany of the stories centered around me hunting bandits and rescuing young girls. But none of them came terribly close to the truth. No story can move a thousand miles by word of mouth and keep its shape.\nWhile the details differed, most of them followed a familiar thread: young women were in need of rescuing. Sometimes a nobleman hired me. Sometimes it was a concerned father, a distraught mayor, or a bumbling constable.\nMost of the time I saved a pair of girls. Sometimes only one, sometimes there were three. They were best friends. They were mother and daughter. I heard one story where there were seven of them, all sisters, all beautiful princesses, all virgins. You know that sort of story.\nThere was a great deal of variety as to who exactly I was rescuing the girls from. Bandits were fairly common, but there were also wicked uncles, stepmothers, and shamble-men. One story, in an odd twist, had me rescuing them from Adem mercenaries. There was even an ogre or two.\nWhile I did occasionally rescue the girls from a troupe of traveling players, I\u2019m proud to say I never heard a story where they were kidnapped by the Edema Ruh.\nThe story generally had one of two endings. In the first I leapt to the battle like Prince Gallant and fought sword on sword until everyone was dead, fled, or appropriately repentant. The second ending was more popular. It involved me calling down fire and lightning from the sky after the fashion of Taborlin the Great.\nIn my favorite version of the story, I met a helpful tinker on the road. I", "shared my dinner, and he told me of two children stolen from a nearby farm. Before I left, he sold me an egg, three iron nails, and a shabby cloak that could render me invisible. I used the items and my considerable wit to save the children from the clutches of a cunning, hungry trow.\nBut while there were many versions of that tale, the story of Felurian was more popular by far. The song I\u2019d written had made the journey west as well. And since songs hold their shape better than stories, the details about my encounter with Felurian were moderately close to the truth.\nWhen Wil and Sim pressed me for details, I told them the whole story. It took me a while to convince them I was telling the truth. Rather, it took me a while to convince Sim. For some reason,Wil was perfectly willing to accept the existence of the Fae.\nI didn\u2019t blame Sim. Until I saw her, I would have bet solid money Felurian didn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s one thing to enjoy a story, but it\u2019s quite another to take it for the truth.\n\u201cThe real question,\u201d Sim said thoughtfully, \u201cis how old you really are.\u201d \u201cI know that one,\u201d Wilem said with the somber pride of someone\ndesperately pretending to not be drunk. \u201cSeventeen.\u201d\n\u201cAhhhh . . .\u201d Sim held up a finger dramatically. \u201cYou\u2019d think so, wouldn\u2019t\nyou?\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I asked.\nSim leaned forward in his chair. \u201cYou went into the Fae, spent some time\nthere, then came out to discover only three days had passed,\u201d Sim said. \u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re only three days older? Or did you age while you were there?\u201d\nI was quiet for a moment. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that,\u201d I admitted.\n\u201cIn stories,\u201d Wilem said, \u201cboys go into Fae and return as men.That implies one grows older.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to go by stories,\u201d Sim said.\n\u201cWhat else?\u201d Wil asked. \u201cWill you consult Marlock\u2019s Compendium of Fae Phenomenon? Find me such a book, and I will reference it.\u201d\nSim gave an agreeable shrug.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Wil said, turning to me. \u201cHow long were you there?\u201d\n \n\u201cThat\u2019s hard to figure,\u201d I said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any day or night. And my memories are a bit odd.\u201d I thought for a long moment. \u201cWe talked, swam, ate dozens upon dozens of times, explored a bit. And, well ...\u201d I paused to clear my throat meaningfully.\n\u201cCavorted,\u201d suggested Wil.\n\u201cThank you. And cavorted quite a bit as well.\u201d I counted the skills Felurian had taught me, and then figured she couldn\u2019t have taught me more than two or three a day. . . .\n\u201cIt was at least a couple months,\u201d I said. \u201cI shaved once, or was it twice? Time enough for me to grow a bit of a beard.\u201d\nWil rolled his eyes at this, running his hand over his own dark Cealdish beard.\n\u201cNothing like your marvelous facebear,\u201d I said. \u201cStill, mine grew out at least two or three times.\u201d\n\u201cSo at least two months,\u201d Sim said. \u201cBut how long could it have been?\u201d\n\u201cThree months?\u201d How many stories had we shared? \u201cFour or five months?\u201d I thought of how slowly we\u2019d had to move my shaed from starlight to moonlight to firelight. \u201cA year?\u201d I thought about the wretched time I\u2019d spent recovering from my encounter with the Cthaeh. \u201cI\u2019m sure it couldn\u2019t have been more than a year. . . .\u201d My voice didn\u2019t sound nearly as convincing as I would have liked.\nWilem raised an eyebrow. \u201cWell then, happy birthday.\u201d He lifted his glass to me. \u201cOr birthdays, depending.\u201d", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-SIX\nFailures\nDURING SPRING TERM I experienced several failures.\nThe first of these was mostly a failure in my own eyes. I had expected that\npicking up Yllish would be relatively easy. But nothing could have been further from the truth.\nIn a handful of days I had learned enough Tema to defend myself in court. But Tema was a very orderly language, and I\u2019d already known a little bit from my studies. Perhaps most importantly, there was a great deal of overlap between Tema and Aturan. They used the same characters for writing, and many words are related.\nYllish shared nothing with Aturan or Shaldish, or even with Ademic for that matter. It was an irrational, tangled mess. Fourteen indicative verb tenses. Bizarre formal inflections of address.\nYou couldn\u2019t merely say \u201cthe Chancellor\u2019s socks.\u201d Oh no. Too simple. All ownership was oddly dual: as if the Chancellor owned his socks, but at the same time the socks somehow also gained ownership of the Chancellor. This altered the use of both words in complex grammatical ways. As if the simple act of owning socks somehow fundamentally changed the nature of a person.\nSo even after months of study with the Chancellor, Yllish grammar was still a muddy jumble to me. All I had to show for my work was a messy smattering of vocabulary. My understanding of the story knots was even worse. I tried to improve matters by practicing with Deoch. But he wasn\u2019t much of a teacher and admitted the only person he\u2019d ever known who could read story knots had been his grandmother who had died when he was very young.\nSecond came my failure in advanced chemistry, taken under Mandrag\u2019s giller, Anisat. While the material fascinated me, I did not get along with Anisat himself.\nI loved the discovery chemistry offered. I loved the thrill of experiment, the challenge of trial and retrial. I loved the puzzle of it. I also will admit a", "somewhat foolish fondness toward the apparatus involved. The bottles and tubes. The acids and salts. The mercury and flame. There is something primal in chemistry, something that defies explication. Either you feel it or you don\u2019t.\nAnisat didn\u2019t feel it. For him chemistry was written journals and carefully penned rows of numbers. He would make me perform the same titration four times simply because my notation was incorrect. Why write a number down? Why should I take ten minutes to write what my hands could finish in five?\nSo we argued. Gently at first, but neither of us were willing to back down. As a result, barely two span into the term we ended up shouting at each other in the middle of the Crucible while thirty students looked on, openmouthed with dismay.\nHe told me to leave his class, calling me an irreverent dennerling with no respect for authority. I called him a pompous slipstick who had missed his true calling as a counting-house scribe. In all fairness, we both had some valid points.\nMy other failure came in mathematics. After listening to Fela chatter excitedly for months about what she was learning under Master Brandeur, I set out to further my number lore.\nUnfortunately the loftier peaks of mathematics did not delight me. I am no poet. I do not love words for the sake of words. I love words for what they can accomplish. Similarly, I am no arithmetician. Numbers that speak only of numbers are of little interest to me.\nDue to my abandonment of chemistry and arithmetic, I had a great deal of free time on my hands. Some of this I spent in the Fishery, making a Bloodless of my own that sold practically before it hit the shelves. I also spent a fair amount of time in the Archives and the Medica, doing research for an essay titled \u201cOn the Non-Efficacy of Arrowroot.\u201d Arwyl was skeptical, but agreed my initial research warranted attention.\nI also spent some of my time romantically. It was a new experience for me, as I had never caught the eye of women before. Or if I had, I hadn\u2019t known what to do with the attention.\nBut I was older now, and wiser to some degree. And because of the stories circulating, women on both sides of the river were beginning to show an interest in me.\nMy romances were all pleasant and brief. I cannot say why brief, except to state the obvious: that I do not have much in me that might encourage a", "woman to make long habit of my company. Simmon, for example, had a great deal to offer. He was a gemstone in the rough. Not stunning at first glance, but with a great deal of worth beneath the surface. Sim was tender, kind, and attentive as any woman could care for. He made Fela deliriously happy. Sim was a prince.\nBy contrast, what did I have to offer? Nothing really. Less now. I was more like a curious stone that is picked up, carried a while, and finally dropped again with the realization that for all its interesting look, it is nothing more than hardened earth.\n\u201cMaster Kilvin,\u201d I asked. \u201cCan you think of a metal that will stand hard use for two thousand years and remain relatively unworn or unblemished?\u201d\nThe huge artificer looked up from the brass gear he was inscribing and eyed me standing in the doorway of his office. \u201cAnd what manner of project are you planning now, Re\u2019lar Kvothe?\u201d\nIn the last three months, I\u2019d been trying to create another schema as successful as my Bloodless. Partly for the money, but also because I\u2019d learned that Kilvin was much more likely to promote students with three or four impressive schema to their credit.\nUnfortunately, I had met with a string of failures here, too. I\u2019d had more than a dozen clever ideas, none of which had led to a finished design.\nMost of the ideas were struck down by Kilvin himself. Eight of my clever ideas had already been created, some of them more than a hundred years ago. Five of them, Kilvin informed me, would require the use of runes that were forbidden to Re\u2019lar. Three of them were mathematically unsound, and he quickly sketched out how they were doomed to failure, saving me dozens of hours of wasted time.\nOne of my ideas, he rejected as \u201cutterly inappropriate for a responsible artificer.\u201d I argued that a mechanism that would cut the time needed to reload a ballista would help ships defend against piracy. It would help defend towns against attack by Vi Sembi raiders. . . .\nBut Kilvin would hear none of it. When his face began to grow dark as a storm cloud, I quickly abandoned my carefully planned arguments.\nIn the end, only two of my ideas were sound, acceptable, and original. But\n \nafter weeks of work, I was forced to abandon them as well, unable to get them to work.\nKilvin set down his stylus and half-inscribed brass gear, turning to face me. \u201cI admire a student who thinks in terms of durability, Re\u2019lar Kvothe. But a thousand years is a great deal to ask of stone, let alone metal. To say nothing of metal put to heavy use.\u201d\nI was asking about Caesura, of course. But I hesitated to tell Kilvin the full truth. I knew all too well that the Master Artificer did not approve of artificery being used in conjunction with any sort of weapon. While he might appreciate the craftsmanship of such a sword, he would not think well of me for owning such a thing.\nI smiled. \u201cIt isn\u2019t for a project,\u201d I said. \u201cI was just curious. During my travels I was shown a sword that was quite serviceable and sharp. Despite this, there seemed to be proof that it was over two thousand years old. Do you know of any metal that could avoid breaking for so long as that? Let alone keep an edge?\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d Kilvin nodded, his expression not particularly surprised. \u201cThere are such things. Old magics, one could say. Or old arts now lost to us. These things are scattered through the world. Marvelous devices. Mysteries. There are many reliable sources that speak of the ever-burning lamp.\u201d He gestured with a broad hand at the hemispheres of glass laid out on his worktable. \u201cWe even possess a handful of these things here at the University.\u201d\nI felt my curiosity flare up. \u201cWhat sort of things?\u201d I asked.\nKilvin tugged his beard idly with one hand. \u201cI have a device devoid of any sygaldry that seems to do nothing but consume angular momentum. I have four ingots of white metal, lighter than water, that I can neither melt nor mar in any way. A sheet of black glass, one side of which lacks any frictive properties at all. A piece of oddly shaped stone that maintains a temperate slightly above freezing, no matter what the heat around it.\u201d His massive shoulders shrugged. \u201cThese things are mysteries.\u201d\nI opened my mouth, then hesitated. \u201cWould it be inappropriate for me to ask to see some of these things?\u201d\nKilvin\u2019s smile was very white against the dark of his skin and his beard. \u201cIt is never inappropriate to ask, Re\u2019lar Kvothe,\u201d he said. \u201cA student should be curious. I would be troubled if you were indifferent to such things.\u201d\nThe big artificer went to his large wooden desk, so strewn with half- finished projects that the surface was barely visible. He unlocked a drawer", "with a key from his pocket and drew out two dull metal cubes, slightly larger than dice.\n\u201cMany of these old things we cannot fathom or make use of,\u201d he said. \u201cBut some possess remarkable utility.\u201d He rattled the two metal cubes as if they were dice, and they rang together sweetly in his hand. \u201cWe call these warding stones.\u201d\nHe bent and set them on the floor, spaced several feet apart from each other. He touched them and spoke very softly under his breath, too quietly for me to hear.\nI felt a subtle change in the air. At first I thought that the room was growing colder, but then I realized the truth: I couldn\u2019t feel the radiant heat of the smoldering forge at the other end of Kilvin\u2019s office.\nKilvin casually picked up the bar of iron used to stir the forge and swung it hard at my head. His gesture was so casual that it caught me completely off my guard, and I didn\u2019t even have time to cower or flinch away.\nThe bar stopped two feet away from me, as if striking some unseen obstruction. There was no sound as if it had struck something, neither did it rebound in Kilvin\u2019s grip.\nI reached out my hand cautiously and it butted up against . . . nothing. It was as if the intangible air in front of me was suddenly made solid.\nKilvin grinned at me. \u201cThe warding stones are of particular use when performing dangerous experiments or testing certain equipment,\u201d he said. \u201cThey somehow produce a thaumic and kinetic barrier.\u201d\nI continued to run my hand along the unseen barrier. It wasn\u2019t hard, or even solid. It gave way slightly when I pushed at it and felt slippery as buttered glass.\nKilvin watched me, his expression faintly amused. \u201cTruthfully, Re\u2019lar Kvothe, until Elodin made his suggestion, I was thinking of calling your arrow-arresting device the Minor Ward.\u201d He frowned slightly. \u201cNot entirely accurate, of course, but more so than Elodin\u2019s dramatic nonsense.\u201d\nI leaned hard against the unseen barrier. It was solid as a stone wall. Now that I was looking more closely, I could see a subtle distortion in the air, as if I were looking through a slightly imperfect sheet of glass. \u201cThis is far superior to my arrowcatch, Master Kilvin.\u201d\n\u201cTrue.\u201d Kilvin gave a conciliatory nod and bent to pick up the stones, muttering again under his breath. I staggered a little when the barrier disappeared. \u201cBut your cleverness we can repeat endlessly. This mystery we", "cannot.\u201d\nKilvin held up the two cubes of metal on the palm of his huge hand.\n\u201cThese are useful, but never forget: cleverness and caution profit the artificer. We do our work in the realm of the real.\u201d He closed his fingers over the warding stones. \u201cLeave mystery to poets, priests, and fools.\u201d\nDespite my other failures, my study with Master Elodin was progressing rather well. He claimed all I needed to improve myself as a namer was time and dedication. I gave him both, and he put them to use in odd ways.\nWe spent hours riddling. He made me drink a pint of applejack, then read Teccam\u2019s Theophany from cover to cover. He made me wear a blindfold for three days straight, which didn\u2019t improve my performance in my other classes, but amused Wil and Sim to no end.\nHe encouraged me to see how long I could stay awake. And since I could afford all the coffee I liked, I managed nearly five days. Though by the end I was rather manic and starting to hear voices.\nAnd there was the incident on the roof of the Archives. Everyone has heard about that in one version or another, it seems.\nThere was a great beast of a thunderstorm rolling in, and Elodin decided it would do me good to spend some time in the middle of it. The closer the better, he said. He knew Lorren would never allow us access to the roof of the Archives, so Elodin simply stole the key.\nUnfortunately, that meant when the key went tumbling off the roof, no one knew we were trapped up there. As a result the two of us were forced to spend the entire night on the bare stone rooftop, caught in the teeth of the furious storm.\nIt wasn\u2019t until midmorning that the weather calmed enough for us to call down to the courtyard for help. Then, as there didn\u2019t seem to be a second key, Lorren took the straightest course and had several burly scrivs simply batter down the door leading to the roof.\nNone of this would have been a particular problem if, just as it had started to rain, Elodin hadn\u2019t insisted that we strip ourselves naked, wrap our clothes in an oilskin, and weigh them down with a brick. According to Elodin, it would help me experience the storm to the fullest degree possible.\n \nThe winds were stronger than he\u2019d expected, and they had snatched both the brick and our bundled clothes, hurling them into the sky like a handful of leaves. That was how we lost the key, you see. It had been in the pocket of Elodin\u2019s pants.\nBecause of this, Master Lorren, Lorren\u2019s giller Distrel, and three brawny scrivs found Elodin and me stark naked and wet as drowned rats on the roof of the Archives. Within fifteen minutes, everyone in the University had heard the story. Elodin laughed his head off at the whole thing, and though I can see the humor of it now, at the time I was far from amused.\nI won\u2019t burden you with the entire list of our activities. Suffice to say that Elodin went to great lengths to wake my sleeping mind. Ridiculous lengths, really.\nAnd much to my surprise, our work paid dividends. I called the name of the wind three times that term.\nThe first time I stilled the wind for the space of a long breath while standing on Stonebridge in the middle of the night. Elodin was there, coaching me. By which I mean he was prodding me with a riding crop. I was also barefoot and more than slightly drunk.\nThe second time came on me unexpectedly while I was studying in Tomes. I was reading a book of Yllish history when suddenly the air in the cavernous room whispered to me. I listened as Elodin had taught me, then spoke it gently. Just as gently the hidden wind stirred into a breeze, startling the students and sending the scrivs into a panic.\nThe name faded from my mind some minutes later, but while it lasted I held the certain knowledge that should I wish it, I could stir a storm or start a thunderclap with equal ease. The knowledge itself had to be enough for me. If I had called the wind\u2019s name strongly in the Archives, Lorren would have hung me by my thumbs above the outer doors.\nYou may not think these terribly impressive feats of naming, and I suppose you are right. But I called the wind a third time that spring, and third time pays for all.", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-SEVEN\nDebts\nSINCE I HAD A great deal of free time on my hands, midway through the term I hired the use of a two horse fetter-cart and headed to Tarbean on a bit of a lark.\nIt took me all of Reaving to get there, and I spent most of Cendling visiting old haunts and paying old debts: a cobbler who had been kind to a shoeless boy, an innkeeper who had let me sleep on his hearth some nights, a tailor I had terrorized.\nParts of Waterside were strikingly familiar, while other pieces I didn\u2019t recognize at all. That didn\u2019t particularly surprise me. A city as busy as Tarbean is constantly changing. What did surprise me was the strange nostalgia I felt for this place that had been so cruel to me.\nI had been gone for two years. For all practical purposes it was a lifetime ago.\nIt had been a span of days since the last rain, and the city was dry as a bone. The shuffling feet of a hundred thousand people kicked up a cloud of fine dust that filled the city streets. It covered my clothes and got in my hair and eyes, making them itch. I tried not to dwell on the fact that it was mostly pulverized horseshit, with an assortment of dead fish, coal smoke, and urine thrown in for flavor.\nIf I breathed through my nose, I was assaulted with the smell. But if I breathed through my mouth, I could taste it, and the dust filled my lungs making me cough. I didn\u2019t remember it being as bad as this. Had it always been so dirty here? Had it always smelled this bad?\nAfter half an hour of searching, I finally found the burned-out building with a basement underneath. I made my way down the stairs and through the long hallway to a damp room. Trapis was still there, barefoot and wearing the same tattered robe, tending to his hopeless children in the cool dark below the city streets.\nHe recognized me. Not as other people would, not as a budding hero out of", "stories. Trapis had no time for such things. He remembered me as the smudgy, starveling boy who fell down his stairs fever-sick and crying one winter night. You could say I loved him even more for that.\nI gave him as much money as he would take: five talents. I tried to give him more, but he refused. If he spent too much money, he said, it would attract the wrong sort of attention. He and his children were safest if nobody noticed them.\nI bowed to his wisdom and spent the remainder of the day helping him. I pumped water and fetched bread. I made a quick examination of the children, then took a trip to an apothecary and brought back a few things that would help.\nLastly I tended to Trapis himself, at least as much as he would allow. I rubbed his poor, swollen feet with camphor and mother\u2019s leaf, then made him a gift of tight-fitting stockings and a good pair of shoes so he wouldn\u2019t have to go barefoot in the damp of the basement anymore.\nAs the afternoon faded into evening, ragged children began to arrive in the basement. They came looking for a bit of food, or because they were hurt or hoping for a safe place to sleep. They all eyed me suspiciously. My clothes were new and clean. I didn\u2019t belong there. I wasn\u2019t welcome.\nIf I stayed there would be trouble. At the very least, my presence would make some of the starveling children so uncomfortable they wouldn\u2019t stay the night. So I said good-bye to Trapis and left. Sometimes leaving is the only thing you can do.\nSince I had a few hours before the taverns started to fill up, I bought a single piece of creamy writing paper and a matching envelope of heavy parchment. They were extremely fine quality, much nicer than anything I\u2019d ever owned before.\nNext I found a quiet caf\u00e9 and ordered drinking chocolate with a glass of water. I arranged the paper on the table and brought out pen and ink from my shaed. Then I wrote in an elegant, fluid script:\nAmbrose,\nThe child is yours.You know it is true and so do I.\n \nI fear my family will disown me. If you do not behave as a gentleman and see to your obligations, I will go to your father and tell him everything.\nDo not test me in this, I am resolved.\nI didn\u2019t sign a name, merely wrote a single initial which could have been an ornate R or perhaps a shaky B.\nThen, dipping my finger into my glass of water, I let several drops fall onto the page. They swelled the paper a bit and smeared the ink slightly before I blotted them away. They made a fair approximation of teardrops.\nI let one final heavy drop fall onto the initial I\u2019d signed, obscuring it even more. Now the letter looked as if it could also be an F or a P or an E. Perhaps even a K. It could be anything, really.\nI folded the paper carefully, then walked over to one of the room\u2019s lamps and melted a generous blob of sealing wax onto the fold. On the outside of the envelope I wrote:\nAmbrose Jakis\nUniversity (Two miles west of Imre) Belenay-Barren\nCentral Commonwealth\nI paid for my drink and headed to Drover\u2019s Lot. When I was just a few streets away I removed my shaed and tucked it into my travelsack. Then I dropped the letter in the street and stepped on it, scuffing it around with my foot a bit before picking it up and brushing it off.\nI was almost to the square when I saw the final thing I needed. \u201cHoy there,\u201d I said to an old, whiskery man sitting against a building. \u201cI\u2019ll give you ha\u2019penny if you let me borrow your hat.\u201d\nThe old man pulled the draggled thing off and looked at it. His head was very bald and very pale underneath. He squinted a bit in the late afternoon sunlight. \u201cMy hat?\u201d he asked, his voice rough. \u201cYou can have it for a whole penny, and my blessing too.\u201d He gave a hopeful grin as he held out a thin, shaky hand.\nI gave him a penny. \u201cCould you hold this for a second?\u201d I passed him the envelope, then used both hands to screw the old, shapeless hat down over my ears. I used a nearby shop window to make sure every scrap of my red hair", "was tucked away underneath.\n\u201cSuits you,\u201d the old man said, giving a phlegmy cough. I reclaimed the\nletter and eyed the smudgy fingerprints he\u2019d left.\nFrom there it was a quick step to Drover\u2019s Square. I slouched a bit and\nnarrowed my eyes as I wandered through the milling throng. After a couple minutes my ear caught the distinctive sound of a southern Vintish accent, and I walked over to a handful of men loading a wagon with burlap sacks.\n\u201cHoy,\u201d I said, putting on the same accent. \u201cYou folk heading up Imre- way?\u201d\nOne of the men heaved his sack into the wagon and walked over, dusting off his hands. \u201cHeadin\u2019 through there,\u201d he said. \u201cYou looking for a ride?\u201d\nI shook my head and brought the letter out of my travelsack. \u201cI\u2019ve got a letter for up that way. I was going to take it myself but my ship sails tomorrow. I bought it from a sailor off in Gannery for a full quater bit,\u201d I said. \u201cHe had it himself off some noble gel for a single bit.\u201d I winked. \u201cShe was quite urgent that it get to him, I hear.\u201d\n\u201cYeh paid quater bit?\u201d the man said, already shaking his head. \u201cYeh grummer. En\u2019t nobody going to pay that much for a letter.\u201d\n\u201cHeh,\u201d I said, holding up a finger. \u201cYeh en\u2019t seen who\u2019s it for yet.\u201d I held it up for him to see.\nHe squinted. \u201cJakis?\u201d he said slowly, then his face lit with recognition. \u201cIs that Baron Jakis\u2019 boy, then?\u201d\nI nodded smugly. \u201cThe eldest himself. Boy rich as that should pay a fair piece for a letter from his lady. Much as whole noble, I figure.\u201d\nHe eyed the letter. \u201cCould be,\u201d he said cautiously. \u201cBut look. It en\u2019t got anything on it other than University. I been up that way. That en\u2019t a small place.\u201d\n\u201cBaron Jakis\u2019 boy en\u2019t going to sleep in a tin shack,\u201d I said crossly. \u201cAsk someone what the fanciest place is, that\u2019s where he\u2019ll be.\u201d\nThe man nodded to himself, his hand creeping unconsciously toward his purse. \u201cI suppose I could take it off your hands,\u201d he said grudgingly. \u201cBut only at a quater bit. I\u2019m taking a risk anyways at that.\u201d\n\u201cHave a heart, now!\u201d I protested pitifully. \u201cI brought it eight hundred miles! That\u2019s worth better\u2019n nothing!\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d he said, pulling coins out of his purse. \u201cI\u2019ll give you three bits then.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d take half a round,\u201d I grumbled.", "\u201cYou\u2019ll take three bits,\u201d he said, holding out a grubby hand.\nI handed him the letter. \u201cRemember to tell him it\u2019s from a noble lady,\u201d I said as I turned to leave. \u201cRich tosh. Get whatever yeh can off him, that\u2019s what I say.\u201d\nI left the square, then straightened my shoulders and took off the hat. I pulled my shaed back out of my travelsack and swirled it easily around my shoulders. I started to whistle, and as I passed the bald old beggar, I returned his hat and gave him the three bits besides.\nWhen I first heard the stories people were telling about me at the University, I\u2019d expected them to be short-lived. I thought they would flare up, then die just as quickly, like a fire exhausting its fuel.\nBut that hadn\u2019t been the case. The tales of Kvothe rescuing girls and bedding Felurian mixed and mingled with scraps of truth and the ridiculous lies I\u2019d spread to bolster my reputation. There was fuel aplenty, so the stories swirled and spread like a brushfire with the wind blowing hard behind it.\nHonestly, I didn\u2019t know if I should be amused or alarmed. When I went to Imre, people would point at me and whisper to each other. My notoriety spread until it was impossible for me to casually cross the river and eavesdrop on the stories people told.\nTarbean, on the other hand, was forty miles away.\nAfter I left Drover\u2019s Lot behind, I returned to the room I\u2019d rented in one of the nicer parts of Tarbean. In this part of the city, the wind off the ocean brushed away the stink and the dust, leaving the air feeling sharp and clear. I called up water for a bath, and in a fit of lavish spending that would have left my younger self dizzy, I paid three pennies to have the porter take my clothes to the nearest Cealdish laundry.\nThen, clean and sweet smelling again, I went down to the taproom.\nI\u2019d picked the inn carefully. It wasn\u2019t fancy, but wasn\u2019t seedy either. The taproom was low-ceilinged and intimate. It sat at the corner of two of Tarbean\u2019s most well-traveled roads, and I could see Cealdish traders rubbing elbows with Yllish sailors and Vintish wagoneers. It was the perfect place for stories.\nIt wasn\u2019t long before I was lurking at the end of the bar, listening to how I\n \nhad killed the Black Beast of Trebon. I was stunned. I had actually killed a rampaging draccus in Trebon, but when Nina had come to visit me a year ago, she hadn\u2019t known my name. My growing reputation had somehow swept through the town of Trebon and gathered up that story in its wake.\nThere at the bar, I learned many things. Apparently, I owned a ring of amber which could force demons to obey me. I could drink all night and never be the worse for it. Locks opened at the barest touch of my hand, and I had a cloak made all out of cobwebs and shadows.\nThat was also the first time I heard anyone call me Kvothe the Arcane. It was not a new name, apparently. The cluster of men listening to the story simply nodded along when they heard it.\nI learned that Kvothe the Arcane knew a word that would stop arrows dead in the air. Kvothe the Arcane only bled if the knife that cut him was made of raw, untempered iron.\nThe young clerk was building to the dramatic finish of the story, and I was genuinely curious as to how I was going to stop the demon beast with my ring shattered and my cloak of shadows nearly burned away. But just as I forced my way into Trebon\u2019s church, shattering the door with a magic word and a single blow of my bare hand, the door of the inn burst open, startling everyone as it banged hard against the wall.\nA young couple stood there. The woman was young and beautiful, dark- haired and dark-eyed. The man was richly dressed and pale with panic. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s the matter!\u201d he cried, looking about wildly. \u201cWe were just walking and then she couldn\u2019t breathe!\u201d\nI was at her side before anyone else in the room had time to stand. She had half-collapsed onto an empty bench, with her escort hovering over her. She had one hand pressed against her chest while the other pushed him away weakly. The man ignored it and crowded close to her, speaking in a low, urgent voice. The woman kept sliding away from him until she was at the edge of the bench.\nI pushed him ungently aside. \u201cI think she wants her space from you right now.\u201d\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d he demanded, his voice shrill. \u201cAre you a physician? Who is this man? Someone fetch a physician at once!\u201d He tried to elbow me aside.\n\u201cYou!\u201d I pointed to a large sailor sitting at a table. \u201cTake this man and put him over there.\u201d My voice snapped like a whip and the sailor jumped to his feet, grabbed the young gentleman by the back of his neck, and scuffed him", "tidily away.\nI turned back to the woman and watched as her perfect mouth opened. She\nstrained and drew in only the barest rasp of a breath. Her eyes were wild and wet with fear. I moved close to her and spoke in my gentlest tones. \u201cYou will be fine. All is well,\u201d I reassured her. \u201cYou need to look in my eyes.\u201d\nHer eyes fixed on mine, then widened in recognition, in amazement. \u201cI need you to breathe for me.\u201d I laid one hand against her straining chest. Her skin was flushed and hot. Her heart was thrilling like a frightened bird. I laid my other hand along her face. I looked deeply into her eyes. They were like dark pools.\nI leaned close enough to kiss her. She smelled of selas flower, of green grass, of road dust. I felt her strain to breathe. I listened. I closed my eyes. I heard the whisper of a name.\nI spoke it soft, but close enough to brush against her lips. I spoke it quiet, but near enough so that the sound of it went twining through her hair. I spoke it hard and firm and dark and sweet.\nThere was a rush of indrawn air. I opened my eyes. The room was still enough that I could hear the velvet rush of her second desperate breath. I relaxed.\nShe laid her hand over mine, over her heart. \u201cI need you to breathe for me,\u201d she repeated. \u201cThat\u2019s seven words.\u201d\n\u201cIt is,\u201d I said.\n\u201cMy hero,\u201d Denna said, and drew a slow and smiling breath.\n\u201cIt were powerful strange,\u201d I heard the sailor say on the other side of the room. \u201cThere were sommat in his voice. I swear by all the salt in me, I felt like a puppet with my string pulled.\u201d\nI listened with half an ear. I guessed the deckhand simply knew to jump when a voice with the proper ring of authority told him to.\nBut there was no sense in telling him that. My performance with Denna, combined with my bright hair and dark cloak, had identified me as Kvothe. So it would be magic, no matter what I had to say about it. I didn\u2019t mind. What I had done tonight was worthy of a story or two.\nBecause they recognized me, folk were watching us, but not coming very\n \nclose. Denna\u2019s gentleman friend had left before we thought to look for him, so the two of us enjoyed a certain privacy in our small corner of the taproom.\n\u201cI should have known I\u2019d come across you here,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re always where I least expect to find you. Have you migrated away from the University at last?\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cI\u2019m playing truant for a couple days.\u201d \u201cAre you heading back soon?\u201d\n\u201cTomorrow, actually. I\u2019ve got a fetter-cart.\u201d\nShe smiled. \u201cWould you like some company?\u201d\nI gave her a frank look. \u201cYou must know the answer to that.\u201d\nDenna blushed a little and looked away. \u201cI suppose I do.\u201d\nWhen she looked down her hair cascaded off her shoulders, falling around\nher face. It smelled warm and rich, like sunshine and cider. \u201cYour hair,\u201d I said. \u201cLovely.\u201d\nSurprisingly, she blushed even deeper at this and shook her head without looking up at me. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve come to after all this time?\u201d she said, darting a look up at me. \u201cFlattery?\u201d\nIt was my turn to be embarrassed, and I stammered. \u201cI ... I wouldn\u2019t . . . I mean, I would . . .\u201d I took a breath before reaching out to lightly touch a narrow, intricate braid, half-hidden in her hair. \u201cYour braid,\u201d I clarified. \u201cIt almost says lovely.\u201d\nHer mouth made a perfect \u201co\u201d of surprise, and one hand went self- consciously to her hair. \u201cYou can read it?\u201d she said, her voice incredulous, her expression slightly horrified. \u201cMerciful Tehlu, isn\u2019t there anything you don\u2019t know?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been learning Yllish,\u201d I said. \u201cOr trying to. It\u2019s got six strands instead of four, but it\u2019s almost like a story knot, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cAlmost?\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a damn sight more than almost.\u201d Her fingers plucked at the piece of blue string at the end of her braid. \u201cEven Yllish folk barely know Yllish these days,\u201d she said under her breath, plainly irritated.\n\u201cI\u2019m not any good,\u201d I said. \u201cI just know some words.\u201d\n\u201cEven the ones that do speak it don\u2019t bother with the knots.\u201d She glared sideways at me. \u201cAnd you\u2019re supposed to read them with your fingers, not by looking at them.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve mostly had to learn by looking at pictures in books,\u201d I said.\nDenna finally untied the blue string and began to unfurl the braid, her quick fingers smoothing it back into her hair.", "\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that,\u201d I said. \u201cI liked it better before.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s rather the point, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She looked up at me, tilting her chin proudly as she shook out her hair. \u201cThere. What do you think now?\u201d\n\u201cI think I\u2019m afraid to give you any more compliments,\u201d I said, not exactly sure what I\u2019d done wrong.\nHer demeanor softened a bit, her irritation fading. \u201cIt\u2019s just embarrassing. I never expected anyone to be able to read it. How would you feel if someone saw you wearing a sign that said, \u2018I am dashing and handsome\u2019?\u201d\nThere was a pause. Before it could grow uncomfortable, I said, \u201cAm I keeping you from anything pressing?\u201d\n\u201cOnly Squire Strahota.\u201d She made a negligent gesture toward her departed escort.\n\u201cPressing, was he?\u201d I gave a half-smile, raising an eyebrow.\n\u201cAll men press, one way or another,\u201d she said with mock severity. \u201cThey\u2019re still keeping to their book then?\u201d\nDenna\u2019s expression grew rueful and she sighed. \u201cI used to hope they\u2019d\ndisregard the book with age. Instead I\u2019ve found they\u2019ve merely turned a page.\u201d She held up her hand, displaying a pair of rings. \u201cNow instead of roses they give gold, and in the giving they grow sudden bold.\u201d\n\u201cAt least you\u2019re being bored by men of means,\u201d I said consolingly.\n\u201cWho wants a mean man?\u201d she pointed out. \u201cLittle matter if his wealth is above or below the board.\u201d\nI laid a gentling hand on her arm. \u201cYou must forgive these men of mercenary thought. These poor, rich men who, seeing that you can\u2019t be caught, attempt to buy a thing they know cannot be bought.\u201d\nDenna applauded delightedly. \u201cA plea of grace for enemies!\u201d\n\u201cI merely point out that you yourself are not above the giving of gifts,\u201d I said. \u201cAs I myself well know.\u201d\nHer eyes hardened, and she shook her head. \u201cThere is a great difference between a gift given freely, and one that\u2019s meant to tie you to a man.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s truth to that,\u201d I admitted.\u201cGold can make a chain as easily as iron. Still, one can hardly blame a man who hopes to decorate you.\u201d\n\u201cHardly,\u201d she said with smile that was both wry and weary. \u201cMany of their suggestions are rather indecorous.\u201d She looked at me. \u201cWhat of you? Would you have me decorated or indecorous?\u201d\n\u201cI have given some thought to that,\u201d I said with a secret smile, knowing I had her ring tucked safely away in my room at Anker\u2019s. I made a show of", "looking her over. \u201cBoth have their merits, but gold is not for you. You are too bright for burnishing.\u201d\nDenna gripped my arm and squeezed it, giving me a fond smile. \u201cOh my Kvothe, I\u2019ve missed you. Half the reason I came back to this corner of the world was in the hope of finding you.\u201d She stood and held out her arm to me. \u201cCome, take me away from all this.\u201d", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-EIGHT\nThe Stories of Stones\nON THE LONG RIDE back to Imre, Denna and I spoke of a hundred small things. She told me about the cities she had seen: Tinu\u00eb, Vartheret, Andenivan. I told her about Ademre and showed her a few pieces of hand- language.\nShe teased me about my growing fame, and I told her the truth behind the stories. I told her how things had fallen out with the Maer, and she was properly outraged on my behalf.\nBut there was much we didn\u2019t discuss. Neither of us mentioned how we\u2019d parted ways in Severen. I didn\u2019t know if she had left in anger after our argument, or if she thought I had abandoned her. Any question seemed dangerous. Such a discussion would be uncomfortable at best. At worst it might reignite our previous argument, and that was something I was desperate to avoid.\nDenna carried her harp with her, as well as a large traveling trunk. I guessed her song was finished, and she must be performing it. It bothered me that she would play it in Imre, where countless singers and minstrels would hear and carry it out across the world.\nDespite this, I said nothing. I knew that would be a hard conversation, and I needed to pick the time for it carefully.\nNeither did I mention her patron, though what the Cthaeh had told me preyed on my mind. I thought on it endlessly. Had dreams about it.\nFelurian was another matter we didn\u2019t discuss. For all the jokes Denna made about my rescuing bandits and killing virgins, she never mentioned Felurian. She must have heard the song I\u2019d written, as it was much more popular than the other stories she seemed to know so well. But she never mentioned it, and I was not enough of a fool to bring it up myself.\nSo as we rode there were many things unspoken. The tension built in the air between us as the road jounced away beneath the cart\u2019s wheels. There were gaps and breaks in our conversation, silences that stretched too long,", "silences that were short but terrifyingly deep.\nWe were trapped in the middle of one of those silences when we finally\narrived in Imre. I dropped her off at the Boar\u2019s Head, where she planned to take rooms. I helped her carry her trunk upstairs, but the silence was even deeper there. So I skirted hastily around it, bid her a fond farewell, and fled without so much as kissing her hand.\nThat night I thought of ten thousand things I could have said to her. I lay awake, staring at the ceiling, unable to sleep until the deep, late hours of night.\nI woke early, feeling anxious and uneasy. I had breakfast with Simmon and Fela, then went to Adept Sympathy where Fenton beat me handily three duels in a row, setting him in the top rank for the first time since I\u2019d returned to the University.\nWith no other classes, I bathed and spent long minutes looking through my clothes before deciding on a simple shirt and the green vest Fela said set off my eyes. I worked my shaed into a short cape, then decided not to wear it. I didn\u2019t want Denna thinking of Felurian when I came to call.\nLastly, I slipped Denna\u2019s ring into my vest pocket and set off across the river to Imre.\nOnce at the Boar\u2019s Head I hardly had a chance to touch the door handle before Denna opened it and stepped out onto the street, handing me a basket lunch.\nI was more than slightly surprised. \u201cHow did you know. . .?\u201d\nShe wore a pale blue dress that flattered her and smiled winsomely as she linked arms with me. \u201cWoman\u2019s intuition.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d I said, trying to sound wise. The nearness of her was almost painful. The warmth of her hand on my arm, the smell of her like green leaves and the air before a summer storm. \u201cDo you know where we are bound as well?\u201d\n\u201cOnly that you will take me there.\u201d When she spoke she turned to face me, and I felt her breath against the side of my neck. \u201cI gladly leave my trust in you.\u201d\nI turned to face her, thinking to say one of the clever things I\u2019d thought of last night. But when I met her eyes all words left me. I was lost in wonder,\n \nfor how long I cannot even guess. For a long moment I was wholly hers. . . . Denna laughed, jogging me from a reverie that might have stretched a\nmoment or a minute. We made our way out of town, talking as easily as if there had never been a thing between us but sunlight and spring air.\nI led her to a place I\u2019d found earlier that spring, a small dell sheltered by the backs of trees. A stream meandered past a greystone that lay lengthwise on the ground, and the sun shone on a field of bright daisies stretching their faces to the sky.\nDenna caught her breath when we crested the ridge and saw the carpet of daisies open out in front of her. \u201cI\u2019ve waited a long time to show these flowers how pretty you are,\u201d I said.\nThat won me an enthusiastic embrace and a kiss burning on my cheek. Both were over before I knew they\u2019d begun. Bemused and grinning, I led the way through the daisies to the greystone near the stream.\nI removed my shoes and socks. Denna kicked off her shoes and tied up her skirts, then she ran to the center of the stream until the water rose past her knees.\n\u201cDo you know the secret of stones?\u201d she asked as she reached into the water. The hem of her dress dipped into the stream, but she seemed unconcerned.\n\u201cWhat secret is that?\u201d\nShe drew up a smooth, dark stone from the stream bed and held it out to me. \u201cCome see.\u201d\nI finished cuffing up my pants and made my way into the water. She held up the dripping stone. \u201cIf you hold it in your hand and listen to it . . .\u201d She did so, closing her eyes. She stood still for a long moment, her face turned upward, like a flower.\nI was drawn to kiss her, but I resisted.\nFinally she opened her dark eyes. They smiled at me. \u201cIf you listen close enough it will tell you a story.\u201d\n\u201cWhat story did it tell you?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cOnce there was a boy who came to the water,\u201d Denna said. \u201cThis is the story of a girl who came to the water with the boy. They talked and the boy threw the stones as if casting them away from himself. The girl didn\u2019t have any stones, so the boy gave her some. Then she gave herself to the boy, and he cast her away as he would a stone, unmindful of any falling she might feel.\u201d", "I was quiet for a moment, not sure if she was done. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad stone then?\u201d\nShe kissed the stone and dropped it, watching as it settled to the sand. \u201cNo, not sad. But it was thrown once. It knows the feel of motion. It has trouble staying the way most stones do. It takes the offer that the water makes and moves sometimes.\u201d She looked up at me and gave a guileless smile. \u201cWhen it moves it thinks about the boy.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t know what to make of the story, so I tried to change the subject. \u201cHow did you learn to listen to stones?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d be amazed the things you hear if only you take time to listen.\u201d She gestured to the streambed strewn with stones. \u201cTry it.You never know what you might hear.\u201d\nNot sure what game she was playing at, I looked around for a stone, then cuffed up my shirt sleeve and reached into the water.\n\u201cListen,\u201d she prompted earnestly.\nThanks to my studies with Elodin, I had a high tolerance for the ridiculous. I held the stone to my ear and closed my eyes. I wondered if I should pretend to hear a story.\nThen I was in the water, wet to the skin and spitting it. I spluttered and struggled to my feet while Denna laughed so hard she doubled over at the waist, barely able to stand.\nI moved toward her, but she skipped away with a little shriek that left her laughing even harder. So I held off chasing and made a show of wiping water from my face and arms.\n\u201cGive up so easily?\u201d she taunted. \u201cAre you so sudden doused?\u201d\nI lowered my hand into the water. \u201cI was hoping to find my stone again,\u201d I said, pretending to look around for it.\nDenna laughed, shaking her head. \u201cYou\u2019ll not lure me in that easily.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d I said. \u201cI wanted to hear the end of its story.\u201d\n\u201cWhat story was that?\u201d she asked teasingly, not coming any closer.\n\u201cIt was the story of a girl who trifled with a powerful arcanist,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\nmocked him and she scoffed at him. She laughed at him full scornfully. He caught her one day in a brook, and rhyming he did quell her fears. And then the girl forgot to look behind her, and it led to tears.\u201d\nI grinned at her and pulled my hand out of the water.\nShe turned in time for the wave to hit her. It was only as high as her waist, but it was enough to unbalance her. She went under in a swirl of dress and hair and bubbles.", "The current carried her to me and I helped her to her feet, laughing.\nShe came to the surface looking three-days drowned. \u201cNot fair!\u201d she sputtered indignantly. \u201cNot fair!\u201d\n\u201cI disagree,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re the fairest water-maid I hope to see today.\u201d\nShe splashed at me. \u201cFlatter all you like, the truth remains for God to see. You cheated. I used honest trickery.\u201d\nShe tried to dunk me then, but I was ready for it. We struggled for a while until we were pleasantly breathless. Only then did I realize how close she was. How lovely. How little our wet clothing seemed to separate us.\nDenna seemed to realize it at the same time, and we moved a little apart from each other, as if suddenly shy. The wind stirred, reminding us how wet we were. Denna skipped lightly to the shore and stripped away her dress without a moment\u2019s hesitation, tossing it over the greystone to dry. She wore a white shift underneath that clung to her as she made her way back into the water. She gave me a playful push as she passed me by, then crawled atop a smooth black boulder that lay half submerged near the center of the stream.\nIt was a perfect sunning stone, smooth basalt, dark as her eyes. The whiteness of her skin and the too-revealing shift were a sharp contrast against it, almost too bright to look on. She lay on her back and spread her hair to dry. Its wetness made a pattern against the stone that spelled the name of the wind. She closed her eyes and tipped her face toward the sun. Felurian herself could not have been more lovely, more perfectly at ease.\nI moved toward the shore as well and stripped off my sodden shirt and vest. I had to be content with my wet pants, as I had nothing else to wear. \u201cWhat does that stone tell you?\u201d I asked to fill the silence as I laid my shirt next to her dress on the greystone.\nShe ran one hand over the smooth surface of the stone and spoke without opening her eyes. \u201cThis one is telling me what it is like to live in the water, but not be a fish.\u201d She stretched like a cat. \u201cBring the basket over here, would you?\u201d\nI fetched the basket and waded out toward her, moving slowly so as not to splash. She lay perfect and still, as if asleep. But as I watched her mouth curved into a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re quiet.\u201d She said. \u201cBut I can smell you standing there.\u201d\n\u201cNothing bad I hope.\u201d\nShe shook her head gently, still not opening her eyes. \u201cYou smell like dried flowers. Like strange spice smoldering, close to catching flame.\u201d", "\u201cLike river water too, if I have any guess.\u201d\nShe stretched again and smiled an easy smile, showing the perfect whiteness of her teeth, the perfect pinkness of her lips. She shifted her position on the rock slightly. Almost as if she were making room for me. Almost. I thought of joining her. The stone was large enough for two if they were willing to lie close. . . .\n\u201cYes,\u201d Denna said.\n\u201cYes to what?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cYour question,\u201d she said, tilting her face toward me, her eyes still closed.\n\u201cYou\u2019re about to ask me a question.\u201d She adjusted her position slightly on the stone. \u201cThe answer is yes.\u201d\nHow was I to take that? What should I ask for? A kiss? More? How much was too much to ask? Was this a test? I knew asking too much would only drive her away.\n\u201cI was wondering if you would move over a little,\u201d I said gently.\n\u201cYes.\u201d She shifted again, making more space beside her. Then she opened her eyes, and they went wide at the sight of me standing shirtless above her. She glanced down and relaxed when she saw my pants.\nI laughed, but her wide-eyed look of shock pushed me back into caution. I set the basket in the place I had thought to take myself. \u201cWhat thought was that, my lady?\u201d\nShe colored a bit, embarrassed. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you were the sort to bring a girl her lunch while you were running stark.\u201d She gave a little shrug, looked at the basket, at me. \u201cBut I like you this way. My own bare-chested slave.\u201d She closed her eyes again. \u201cFeed me strawberries.\u201d\nI was happy to oblige, and so we passed the afternoon.\nLunch was long gone and the sun had dried us. For the first time since our fight in Severen, I felt things were right between us. The silences no longer lay around us like holes in the road. I knew it had just been a matter of waiting patiently until the tension passed.\nAs the afternoon slowly slid by, I knew this was the right time to bring up the subject I had been biting my tongue over for so long. I could see the dull green of old bruises on her upper arms, the remnant of a raised welt on her\n \nback. There was a scar on her leg above her knee, new enough that the red of it showed through the white of her shift.\nAll I needed to do was ask about them. If I phrased things carefully, she\u2019d admit they were from her patron. From there it would be a simple thing to draw her out. To convince her she deserved better. That whatever he was offering her was not worth this abuse.\nAnd for the first time in my life, I was in a position to offer her a way out. With Alveron\u2019s line of credit and my work in the Fishery, money would never be a problem for me. For the first time in my life, I was wealthy. I could give her a way to escape. . . .\n\u201cWhat happened to your back?\u201d Denna asked softly, interrupting my train of thought. She was still reclining on her stone, I was leaning against it, my feet in the water.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, unconsciously turning a foolish half-circle.\n\u201cYou\u2019re scarred all along your back,\u201d she said gently. I felt one of her cool hands touch my sun-warm skin, tracing a line. \u201cI could hardly tell they were scars at first. They\u2019re pretty.\u201d She traced another line down my back. \u201cIt looks like some giant-child mistook you for a piece of paper and practiced his letters on you with a silver pen.\u201d\nShe took her hand away, and I turned to face her. \u201cHow did you get them?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cI caused some trouble at the University,\u201d I said somewhat sheepishly. \u201cThey whipped you?\u201d she said, incredulous.\n\u201cTwice,\u201d I said.\n\u201cAnd you stay there?\u201d she asked as if she still couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cAfter\nthey did this to you?\u201d\nI shrugged it away. \u201cThere are worse things than whipping,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere else I can learn the things they teach here. When I want a thing it takes more than a little blood to . . .\u201d\nIt was only then I realized what I was saying. The masters whipped me. Her patron beat her. And we both stayed. How could I convince her my situation was different? How could I convince her to leave?\nDenna looked at me curiously, her head tilted to the side. \u201cWhat happens when you want a thing?\u201d\nI shrugged. \u201cI was just saying I\u2019m not easily chased away.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard that about you,\u201d Denna said, giving me a knowing look. \u201cA lot of girls in Imre say you\u2019re not easily chaste.\u201d She sat upright and began to", "slide toward the edge of the stone. Her white shift twisted and slid slowly up her legs as she moved.\nI was about to comment on her scar, hoping I might still bring the conversation around to her patron when I noticed Denna had stopped moving and was watching me as I stared at her bare legs.\n\u201cWhat do they say, exactly?\u201d I asked, more for something to say than from any curiosity.\nShe shrugged. \u201cSome think you\u2019re trying to decimate Imre\u2019s female population.\u201d She edged closer to the lip of the stone. Her shift shifted distractingly.\n\u201cDecimate would imply one in ten,\u201d I said, trying to turn it into a joke. \u201cThat\u2019s slightly ambitious even for me.\u201d\n\u201cHow reassuring,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you bring all of them h\u2014\u201d She made a little gasp as she slipped down the side of the stone. She caught herself just as I was reaching out to help her.\n\u201cBring them what?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cRoses, fool,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cOr have you turned that page already?\u201d \u201cWould you like me to carry you?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said. But before I could reach for her, she slid the rest of the\nway into the water, her shift gathering to a scandalous height before she slipped free into the stream. The water rose to her knee, just dampening the hem.\nWe made our way back to the greystone and silently worked our way into our now-dry clothes. Denna fretted at the wetness at the hem of her shift.\n\u201cYou know, I could have carried you,\u201d I said softly.\nDenna pressed the back of her hand to her forehead. \u201cAnother seven words, I swoon.\u201d She fanned herself with her other hand. \u201cWhat should a woman do?\u201d\n\u201cLove me.\u201d I had intended to say it in my best flippant tone. Teasing. Making a joke of it. But I made the mistake of looking into her eyes as I spoke. They distracted me, and when the words left my mouth, they ended up sounding nothing at all the way I had intended.\nFor a fleet second she held my eyes with intent tenderness. Then a rueful smile quirked up the corner of her mouth. \u201cOh no,\u201d she said. \u201cNot that trap for me. I\u2019ll not be one of the many.\u201d\nI clenched my teeth, stuck somewhere between confusion, embarrassment, and fear. I\u2019d been too bold and made a mess of things, just as I\u2019d always", "feared. When had the conversation managed to run away from me? \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d I said stupidly.\n\u201cYou should.\u201d Denna straightened her clothes, moving with an\nuncharacteristic stiffness, and ran her hands through her hair, twisting it into a thick plait. Her fingers knitted the strands together and for a second I could read it, clear as day: \u201cDon\u2019t speak to me.\u201d\nI might be thick, but even I can read a sign that obvious. I closed my mouth, biting off the next thing I\u2019d been about to say.\nThen Denna saw me eyeing her hair and pulled her hands away self- consciously without tying off the braid. Her hair quickly spun free to fall loose around her shoulders. She brought her hands in front of her and twisted one of her rings nervously.\n\u201cHold a moment,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019d almost forgotten.\u201d I reached into the inner pocket of my vest. \u201cI have a present for you.\u201d\nHer mouth made a thin line as she looked at my outstretched hand. \u201cYou too?\u201d she asked. \u201cI honestly thought you were different.\u201d\n\u201cI hope I am,\u201d I said, and opened my hand. I\u2019d polished it, and the sun caught the edges of the pale blue stone.\n\u201cOh!\u201d Denna\u2019s hands went to her mouth, her eyes suddenly brimming. \u201cIs it really?\u201d She reached out with both hands to take it.\n\u201cIt is,\u201d I said.\nShe turned it over in her hands, then removed one of her other rings and slid it onto her finger. \u201cIt is,\u201d she said in amazement, a few tears spilling over. \u201cHow did you ever. . .?\u201d\n\u201cI got it from Ambrose,\u201d I said.\n\u201cOh,\u201d she said. She shifted her weight from one foot to the other, and I felt the silence loom up between us again.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t much trouble,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m just sorry it took so long.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough for this.\u201d Denna reached out and took my hand between hers.\nYou would think that would have helped. That a gift and clasped hands would make things right between us. But the silence was back now, stronger than before. Thick enough that you could spread it on your bread and eat it. There are some silences that even words cannot drive away. And while Denna was touching my hand, she wasn\u2019t holding it. There is a world of difference.\nDenna looked up at the sky. \u201cThe weather\u2019s turning,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should", "probably head back before it rains.\u201d\nI nodded and we left. Clouds cast their shadows across the field behind us\nas we went.", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-NINE\nTangled\nANKER\u2019S WAS DESERTED EXCEPT for Sim and Fela sitting at one of the back tables. I made my way toward them and sat with my back to the wall.\n\u201cSo?\u201d Sim asked as I slumped into my seat. \u201cHow did yesterday go?\u201d I ignored the question, not really wanting to discuss it.\n\u201cWhat was yesterday?\u201d Fela asked curiously.\n\u201cHe spent the day with Denna,\u201d Sim supplied. \u201cThe whole day.\u201d\nI shrugged.\nSim lost some of his buoyant manner. \u201cNot so well?\u201d he said carefully. \u201cNot particularly,\u201d I said. I looked behind the bar, caught Laurel\u2019s eye, and\ngestured for her to bring me some of whatever was in the pot.\n\u201cCare for a lady\u2019s perspective?\u201d Fela asked gently.\n\u201cI\u2019d settle for yours.\u201d\nSimmon burst out laughing, and Fela made a face. \u201cI\u2019ll help you in spite of\nthat,\u201d she said. \u201cTell Auntie Fela all about it.\u201d\nSo I told her the bones of it. I tried my best to paint a picture of the\nsituation, but the heart of it seemed to defy explication. It sounded foolish when I tried to put it into words.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all,\u201d I said after several minutes of fumbling around the subject. \u201cOr at least that\u2019s enough of my talking about it. She confuses me like no other thing in the world.\u201d I picked at a splinter in the tabletop with my finger. \u201cI hate not understanding a thing.\u201d\nLaurel brought me warm bread and a bowl of potato soup. \u201cAnything else?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks.\u201d I smiled at her, then observed her rear aspect as she made her way back to the bar.\n\u201cAll right then,\u201d Fela said in a businesslike manner. \u201cLet\u2019s start with your good points. You\u2019re charming, handsome, and perfectly courteous to women.\u201d\nSim laughed. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see how he looked at Lauren just now? He\u2019s the", "world\u2019s first lecher. He looks at more women than I could if I had two heads with necks that spun like an owl\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d I admitted.\n\u201cThere\u2019s looking and there\u2019s looking,\u201d Fela said to Simmon. \u201cWhen some men look at you it\u2019s a greasy thing. It makes you want to have a bath. With other men it\u2019s nice. It helps you know you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d She ran a hand absently through her hair.\n\u201cYou hardly need to be reminded,\u201d Simmon said.\n\u201cEveryone needs to be reminded,\u201d she said. \u201cBut with Kvothe it\u2019s different. He\u2019s so serious about it. When he looks at you, you can tell his whole attention is focused on you.\u201d She laughed at my uncomfortable expression. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the things I liked about you when we met.\u201d\nSimmon\u2019s expression darkened, and I tried to look as nonthreatening as possible.\n\u201cBut since you came back it\u2019s almost physical,\u201d Fela said. \u201cNow when you look at me, there\u2019s something happening behind your eyes. Something all sweet fruit, shadows, and lamplight. Something wild that faerie maidens run from underneath a violet sky. It\u2019s a terrible thing, really. I like it.\u201d As she said the last, she squirmed slightly in her seat, a wicked glitter in her eye.\nIt was too much for Simmon. He pushed his chair away from the table and started to get to his feet, making inarticulate gestures. \u201cFine then . . . I\u2019ll just . . . fine.\u201d\n\u201cOh sweetling,\u201d Fela said, laying a hand on his arm. \u201cHush. It\u2019s not like that.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t hush me,\u201d he snapped, but he stayed in his chair.\nFela ran her hand through the hair on the back of Sim\u2019s neck. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing you need to worry over.\u201d She laughed as if the thought was ridiculous. \u201cYou have me tied to you more tightly than you know. But that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t enjoy a little flattery from time to time.\u201d\nSim glowered.\n\u201cShould I cloister myself then?\u201d Fela asked. Irritation crept into her voice, bringing with it the barest lilt of her Modegan accent. \u201cYou know how you feel when Mola takes the time to flirt with you?\u201d Simmon gaped and looked as if he were trying to go pale and blush at the same time. Fela laughed at his bewilderment. \u201cTiny Gods, Sim. Do you think I\u2019m blind? It\u2019s a sweet thing, and it makes you feel good. What\u2019s the harm in it?\u201d\nThere was a pause. \u201cNothing, I suppose,\u201d Sim said finally. Looking up, he", "gave me a shaky grin and brushed his hair back from his eyes. \u201cJust don\u2019t ever give me the look she mentioned, okay?\u201d His grin widened, became more genuine. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I could handle it.\u201d\nI grinned back at him without thinking of it. Sim could always make me smile.\n\u201cBesides,\u201d Fela said to him. \u201cYou\u2019re perfect just the way you are.\u201d She kissed his ear as if to put the seal on his improving mood, then turned back to me. \u201cOn the other hand, you couldn\u2019t pay me enough to get tangled up with you,\u201d she said flatly.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I demanded. \u201cWhat about my look? My dark faerie whateverness?\u201d\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re fascinating. But a girl wants more than that. She wants a man devoted to her.\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cI refuse to throw myself at her like every other man she\u2019s ever met. She hates it. I\u2019ve seen what happens.\u201d\n\u201cHave you ever thought she might feel the same way?\u201d Fela asked. \u201cYou do have something of a reputation with the ladies.\u201d\n\u201cShould I cloister myself then?\u201d I said, repeating what she\u2019d said to Sim, though it came out sharper than I\u2019d intended. \u201cBlackened body of God, I\u2019ve seen her on the arms often dozen men! Suddenly it\u2019s offensive to her if I take another woman out to see a play?\u201d\nFela gave me a frank look. \u201cYou\u2019ve been doing more than going for carriage rides. Women talk.\u201d\n\u201cWonderful. And what do they say?\u201d I asked bitterly, looking down at my soup.\n\u201cThat you\u2019re charming,\u201d she said easily. \u201cAnd polite. You don\u2019t have wandering hands, which is actually a source of frustration in some cases, apparently.\u201d She smiled a little.\nI looked up, curious. \u201cWho?\u201d\nFela hesitated. \u201cMeradin,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t hear it from me.\u201d \u201cShe didn\u2019t say twenty words to me over dinner,\u201d I said, shaking my head.\n\u201cAnd she\u2019s disappointed I didn\u2019t grope her afterward? I thought she hated me.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re a long way from Modeg,\u201d Fela said. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t sensible about sex in this part of the world. Some women don\u2019t know how to deal with a man that doesn\u2019t make bold moves.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat else do they say?\u201d", "\u201cNothing terribly surprising,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile you might not be grabby, it\u2019s certainly no challenge to trip you either. You\u2019re generous, witty, and . . .\u201d She trailed off, looking uncomfortable.\n\u201cGo ahead,\u201d I said.\nFela sighed and added, \u201cDistant.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t the crushing blow I\u2019d expected. \u201cDistant?\u201d\n\u201cSometimes all you\u2019re looking for is dinner,\u201d Fela said. \u201cOr company. Or\nconversation. Or for someone to have a friendly grope at you. But mostly you want a man to . . .\u201d She frowned and started over. \u201cWhen you\u2019re with a man . . .\u201d She trailed off again.\nI leaned forward. \u201cSay what you mean.\u201d\nFela shrugged and looked away. \u201cIf we were together, I\u2019d expect you to leave me. Not right away. Not with any malice or meanness. But I know you would. You don\u2019t seem like the sort who will settle down with a girl forever. Eventually you\u2019d move on to something more important than me.\u201d\nI prodded idly at a bit of potato in my soup, not sure of what to think.\n\u201cThere\u2019s got to be more to it than just devotion,\u201d Sim said. \u201cKvothe would turn the world upside down for this girl. You can see that, can\u2019t you?\u201d\nFela gave me a long look. \u201cI suppose I can,\u201d she said softly.\n\u201cIf you can see it, then Denna must be able to,\u201d Simmon pointed out sensibly.\nFela shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s only easy to see because I\u2019m far enough away.\u201d\n\u201cLove is blind?\u201d Sim laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s the advice you have to offer?\u201d He rolled his eyes. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\u201cI never said I was in love,\u201d I interjected. \u201cI never said that. She confuses me, and I\u2019m fond of her. But it doesn\u2019t go further than that. How could it? I don\u2019t know her well enough to make any earnest claim of love. How can I love something I don\u2019t understand?\u201d\nThey looked at me in silence for a moment. Then Sim burst out in his boyish laugh as if I\u2019d just said the most ridiculous thing he\u2019d ever heard. He took hold of Fela\u2019s hand and kissed it squarely on her multifaceted ring of stone. \u201cYou win,\u201d he said to her. \u201cLove is blind, and a deaf-mute too. I\u2019ll never doubt your wisdom again.\u201d\n \nStill feeling out of sorts, I went looking for Master Elodin, eventually finding him sitting under a tree in a small garden next to the Mews.\n\u201cKvothe!\u201d He waved lazily. \u201cCome. Sit.\u201d He nudged a bowl toward me with his foot. \u201cHave some grapes.\u201d\nI took a few. Fresh fruit wasn\u2019t a rarity for me these days, but the grapes were lovely nonetheless, just on the verge of being overripe. I chewed pensively, my mind still tangled with thoughts of Denna.\n\u201cMaster Elodin,\u201d I asked slowly. \u201cWhat would you think of someone who kept changing their own name?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d He sat up suddenly, his eyes wild and panicked. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d\nHis reaction startled me, and I held up my hands defensively. \u201cNothing!\u201d I insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s not me. It\u2019s a girl I know.\u201d\nElodin\u2019s face grew ashen. \u201cFela?\u201d he said. \u201cOh no. No. She wouldn\u2019t do something like that. She\u2019s too smart for that.\u201d It sounded as if he were desperately trying to convince himself.\n\u201cI\u2019m not talking about Fela,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m talking about a young girl I know. Every time I turn around she\u2019s picked another name for herself.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Elodin said, relaxing. He leaned back against the tree, laughing softly. \u201cCalling names,\u201d he said with tangible relief. \u201cGod\u2019s bones, boy, I thought . . .\u201d He broke off, shaking his head.\n\u201cYou thought what?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d he said dismissively. \u201cNow. What\u2019s this about a girl?\u201d\nI shrugged, beginning to regret bringing it up in the first place. \u201cI was just\nwondering what you\u2019d say about a girl who keeps changing her name. Every time I turn around she\u2019s picked a different one. Dianah. Donna. Dyane.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m assuming she\u2019s not some fugitive?\u201d Elodin asked, smiling. \u201cHunted. Doing her best to evade the iron law of Atur. That sort of thing?\u201d\n\u201cNot to the best of my knowledge,\u201d I said with a faint smile of my own.\n\u201cIt could indicate she doesn\u2019t know who she is,\u201d he said. \u201cOr that she does know, and doesn\u2019t like it.\u201d He looked up and rubbed his nose thoughtfully. \u201cIt could indicate restlessness and dissatisfaction. It could mean her nature is changeable and she shifts her name to fit it. Or it could mean she changes her name with the hope it might help her be a different person.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of nothing,\u201d I said testily. \u201cIt\u2019s like saying you know your soup is either hot or cold. That an apple is either sweet or sour.\u201d I gave him a frown. \u201cIt\u2019s just a complicated way of saying you don\u2019t know anything.\u201d", "\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask me what I knew of such a girl,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cYou asked me what I would say of such a girl.\u201d\nI shrugged, tiring of the subject. We ate grapes in silence as we watched the students come and go.\n\u201cI called the wind again,\u201d I said, realizing I hadn\u2019t told him yet. \u201cDown in Tarbean.\u201d\nHe perked up at that. \u201cDid you now?\u201d he said, turning to look at me expectantly. \u201cLet\u2019s hear it then. All the details. \u201d\nElodin was everything you could want in an audience, attentive and enthusiastic. I related the entire story, not sparing a few dramatic flourishes. By the end of it, I found my mood much improved.\n\u201cThat\u2019s three times this term,\u201d Elodin said approvingly. \u201cSought and found when you had need of it. And not just a breeze but a breath. That\u2019s subtle stuff.\u201d He looked at me from the corner of his eye, giving me a sly smile. \u201cHow long do you think it will be before you can make yourself a ring of air?\u201d\nI lifted up my naked left hand, fingers spread. \u201cWho\u2019s to say I\u2019m not already wearing it?\u201d\nElodin rocked with laughter, then stopped when my expression didn\u2019t change. His brow furrowed a bit as he gave me a speculative look, eyes flickering first to my hand, then back to my face. \u201cAre you joking?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d I said, looking him calmly in the eye. \u201cAm I?\u201d", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY\nFolly\nSPRING TERM ROLLED ON. Contrary to what I\u2019d expected, Denna didn\u2019t make any public performances in Imre. Instead, she headed north to Anilin after a handful of days.\nBut this time she made a special trip to Anker\u2019s to tell me she was leaving. I found myself strangely flattered by this and couldn\u2019t help but feel it was a sign that things were not entirely sour between us.\nThe Chancellor fell ill just as the term was coming to a close. Though I didn\u2019t know him very well, I liked Herma. Not only did I find him to be a surprisingly easygoing teacher when he had been teaching me Yllish, but he had been kind to me when I was new to the University. Nevertheless, I wasn\u2019t particularly worried. Arwyl and the staff of the Medica could do everything just short of bringing people back from the dead.\nBut days passed and no news came from the Medica. Rumor said he was too weak to leave his bed, plagued with spikes of fever that threatened to burn away his powerful arcanist\u2019s mind.\nWhen it became apparent he wouldn\u2019t be able to resume his duties as Chancellor anytime soon, the masters gathered to decide who would fill his place. Perhaps permanently, should his condition worsen.\nAnd, to make a painful story short, Hemme was appointed Chancellor. After the shock wore off, it was easy to see why. Kilvin, Arwyl, and Lorren were too busy to take up the extra duties. The same could be said for Mandrag and Dal to a lesser extent. That left Elodin, Brandeur, and Hemme.\nElodin didn\u2019t want it, and was generally regarded as too erratic to serve. And Brandeur always faced whatever direction Hemme\u2019s own wind was blowing.\nSo Hemme gained the Chancellor\u2019s chair. While I found it irritating, it had little impact on my day-to-day life. The only precaution I took was to step with extra care around even the least of the University\u2019s laws, knowing if I were put on the horns now, Hemme\u2019s vote would count doubly against me.", " As admissions approached, Master Herma remained weak and fevered. So it was with a knot of sour dread in my stomach that I prepared for my first admissions interview with Hemme as Chancellor.\nI went through the questioning with the same careful artifice I\u2019d maintained for the last two terms. I hesitated and made a few mistakes, earning a tuition of twenty talents or so. Enough to earn some money, but not enough to embarrass myself too badly.\nHemme, as always, asked double-sided or misleading questions designed to trip me, but that was nothing new. The only real difference seemed to be that Hemme smiled a great deal. It wasn\u2019t a pleasant smile either.\nThe masters had their usual muted conference. Then Hemme read my tuition: fifty talents. Apparently the Chancellor had greater control over these things than I had ever known.\nI forced myself to bite my lip to keep from laughing, and arranged my face in a dejected expression as I made my way to the basement of Hollows where the bursar kept his counting room. Riem\u2019s eyes brightened at the sight of my tuition slip. He disappeared into his back room and returned in a moment with an envelope of thick paper.\nI thanked him and returned to my room at Anker\u2019s, maintaining my morose expression all the way. Once I had the door closed, I tore open the heavy envelope and poured its contents into my hand: two gleaming gold marks worth ten talents each.\nI laughed then. Laughed until my eyes watered and my sides ached. Then I drew on my best suit of clothes and gathered my friends: Wilem and Simmon, Fela and Mola. I sent a runner boy to Imre with an invitation to Devi and Threpe. Then I hired a four-horse carriage and had the lot of us driven across the river to Imre.\nWe stopped by the Eolian. Denna wasn\u2019t there, but I collected Deoch instead and we made our way to the King\u2019s Arms, an establishment of the sort no self-respecting student could ever afford. The doorman looked the motley lot of us over scornfully, as if he would object, but Threpe frowned his best gentleman\u2019s frown and ushered all of us safely inside.\nThen commenced a night of pleasant decadence the likes of which I have hardly seen equaled since. We ate and drank, and I paid for everything happily. The only water on the table was in the hand bowls. In our cups there", "was only old Vintish wines, dark scutten, cool metheglin, sweet brand, and every toast we drank was to Hemme\u2019s folly.", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-ONE\nLocks\nKVOTHE DREW A DEEP breath and nodded to himself. \u201cLet\u2019s stop there,\u201d he said. \u201cMoney in my pocket for the first time in my life. Surrounded by friends. That\u2019s a good place to end for the night.\u201d He idly rubbed his hands together, right hand massaging the left absentmindedly. \u201cIf we go much farther, things get dark again.\u201d\nChronicler picked up the short stack of finished pages and tapped them on the table, squaring their corners before resting the half-finished page on top. He opened his leather satchel, removed the bright green crown of holly, and slid the pages inside.Then he screwed shut his inkwell and began to dismantle and clean all the pieces of his pen.\nKvothe stood and stretched. Then he gathered up the empty plates and cups, carrying them into the kitchen.\nBast merely sat, his expression blank. He didn\u2019t move. He hardly seemed to be breathing. After several minutes Chronicler began to dart glances in his direction.\nKvothe came back into the room and frowned. \u201cBast,\u201d he said.\nBast slowly turned his eyes to look at the man behind the bar.\n\u201cShep\u2019s wake is still going on,\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cThere\u2019s not much cleaning\nup to do tonight. Why don\u2019t you head over for the end of it? They\u2019ll be glad to have you. . . .\u201d\nBast considered for a moment, then shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Reshi,\u201d he said, his voice flat. \u201cI\u2019m not really in the mood.\u201d He pushed himself out of his chair and made his way across the room toward the stairs without looking either of them in the eye. \u201cI\u2019ll just turn in.\u201d\nThe hard sounds of his footsteps retreated slowly into the distance, followed by the sound of a closing door.\nChronicler watched him go, then turned to look at the red-haired man behind the bar.\nKvothe was looking at the stairway too, his eyes concerned. \u201cHe\u2019s just had", "a rough day,\u201d he said, sounding as if he were speaking to himself as much as his guest. \u201cHe\u2019ll be fine tomorrow.\u201d\nWiping off his hands, Kvothe walked around the bar and headed to the front door. \u201cDo you need anything before you turn in?\u201d he asked.\nChronicler shook his head and began fitting his pen back together.\nKvothe locked the front door with a large brass key, then turned to Chronicler. \u201cI\u2019ll leave this in the lock for you,\u201d he said. \u201cIn case you wake up early and feel like having a walk or somesuch. I don\u2019t tend to sleep very much these days.\u201d He touched the side of his face where a bruise was beginning to mottle his jaw. \u201cBut tonight I might make an exception.\u201d\nChronicler nodded and shouldered his satchel. Then he delicately picked up his holly crown and headed up the stairs.\nAlone in the common room, Kvothe swept the floor methodically, catching all the corners. He finished the dishes, washed the tables and the bar, and rolled down all the lamps but one, leaving the room dimly lit and full of flickering shadow.\nFor a moment he looked at the bottles behind the bar, then turned and made his own slow climb upstairs.\nBast stepped slowly into his room, closing the door behind himself.\nHe moved quietly through the dark to stand before the hearth. Nothing but\nash and cinder remained from the morning\u2019s fire. Bast opened the woodbin, but there was nothing inside except a thick layer of chaff and chips at the bottom.\nThe dim light from the window glinted in his dark eyes and showed the outline of his face as he stood motionless, as if trying to decide what to do. After a moment he let the lid of the bin fall closed, wrapped himself in a blanket, and folded himself onto a small couch in front of the empty fireplace.\nHe sat there for a long while, eyes open in the dark.\nThere was a faint scuffle outside his window. Then nothing. Then a faint scraping. Bast turned and saw a dark shape outside, moving in the night.\nBast went motionless, then slid smoothly from the couch to stand in front of the fireplace. Eyes still on the window, his hands hunted carefully across\n \nthe top of the mantel.\nThere was another scrape at the window, louder this time. Bast\u2019s eyes\ndarted away from the window to the mantel, and he caught up something with both hands. Metal gleamed faintly in the dim moonlight as he crouched, his body tense as a coiled spring.\nFor a long moment there was nothing. No sound. No movement outside the window or in the darkened room.\nTap-tap-tap-tap-tap. It was a faint noise, but perfectly clear in the stillness of the room. There was a pause, then the noise came again, sharp and insistent against the window glass: tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap.\nBast sighed. Relaxing out of his tense crouch, he walked over to the window, threw the drop bar, and opened it.\n\u201cMy window doesn\u2019t have a lock,\u201d Chronicler said petulantly. \u201cWhy does yours?\u201d\n\u201cObvious reasons,\u201d Bast said.\n\u201cCan I come in?\u201d\nBast shrugged and moved back toward the fireplace while Chronicler\nclimbed awkwardly through the window. Bast struck a match and lit a lamp on a nearby table, then carefully set a pair of long knives on the mantel. One was slender and sharp as a blade of grass, the other keen and graceful as a thorn.\nChronicler looked around as light swelled to fill the room. It was large, with rich wood paneling and thick carpets. Two lounging couches faced each other in front of the fireplace, and one corner of the room was dominated by a huge canopy bed with deep green curtains.\nThere were shelves filled with pictures, trinkets, and oddments. Locks of hair wrapped in ribbon. Whistles carved from wood. Dried flowers. Rings of horn and leather and woven grass. A hand-dipped candle with leaves pressed into the wax.\nAnd, in what was obviously a recent addition, holly boughs decorated parts of the room. One long garland ran along the headboard of the bed, and another was strung along the mantle, weaving in and out through the handles of a pair of bright, leaf-bladed hatchets hanging there.\nBast sat back in front of the cold fireplace and wrapped a rag blanket around his shoulders like a shawl. It was a chaos of ill-matching fabric and faded color except for a bright red heart sewn squarely in the center.\n\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d Chronicler said softly.", "Bast shrugged, his eyes fixed dully on the fireplace.\nChronicler took a step closer. \u201cI need to ask you ...\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to whisper,\u201d Bast said without looking up. \u201cWe\u2019re on the\nother side of the inn. Sometimes I have guests. It used to keep him awake, so I moved to this side of the building. There are six solid walls between my room and his.\u201d\nChronicler sat on the edge of the other couch, facing Bast. \u201cI need to ask about some of the things you said tonight. About the Cthaeh.\u201d\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t talk about the Cthaeh.\u201d Bast\u2019s voice was flat and leaden. \u201cIt\u2019s not healthy.\u201d\n\u201cThe Sithe then,\u201d Chronicler said. \u201cYou said if they knew about this story, they\u2019d kill everyone involved. Is that true?\u201d\nBast nodded, eyes still on the fireplace. \u201cThey\u2019d burn this place and salt the earth behind them.\u201d\nChronicler looked down, shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t understand this fear you have of the Cthaeh,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Bast said, \u201cevidence seems to indicate that you\u2019re not terribly smart.\u201d\nChronicler frowned and waited patiently.\nBast sighed, finally pulling his eyes away from the fireplace. \u201cThink. The Cthaeh knows everything you\u2019re ever going to do. Everything you\u2019re going to say . . .\n\u201cThat makes it an irritating conversationalist,\u201d Chronicler said. \u201cBut not \u2014\u201d\nBast\u2019s expression went suddenly furious. \u201cDyen vehat. Enfeun vehat tyloren tes!\u201d he spat almost incoherently. He was trembling, clenching and unclenching his hands.\nChronicler went pale at the venom in Bast\u2019s voice, but he didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cYou\u2019re not angry at me,\u201d he said calmly, looking Bast in the eye. \u201cYou\u2019re just angry, and I happen to be nearby.\u201d\nBast glared at him, but said nothing.\nChronicler leaned forward. \u201cI\u2019m trying to help, you know that, right?\u201d Bast nodded sullenly.\n\u201cThat means I need to understand what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nBast shrugged, his sudden flare of temper had burned itself out, leaving\nhim listless again.\n\u201cKvothe seems to believe you about the Cthaeh,\u201d Chronicler said.", "\u201cHe knows the hidden turnings of the world,\u201d Bast said. \u201cAnd what he doesn\u2019t understand he\u2019s quick to grasp.\u201d Bast\u2019s fingers flicked idly at the edges of the blanket. \u201cAnd he trusts me.\u201d\n\u201cBut doesn\u2019t it seem contrived? The Cthaeh gives a boy a flower, one thing leads to another, and suddenly there\u2019s a war.\u201d Chronicler made a dismissive motion. \u201cThings don\u2019t work that way. It\u2019s too much coincidence.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not coincidence.\u201d Bast gave a short sigh. \u201cA blind man has to stumble through a cluttered room. You don\u2019t. You use your eyes and pick the easy way. It\u2019s clear to you as anything. The Cthaeh can see the future. All futures. We have to fumble through. It doesn\u2019t. It merely looks and picks the most disastrous path. It is the stone that stirs the avalanche. It is the cough that starts the plague.\u201d\n\u201cBut if you know the Cthaeh is trying to steer you,\u201d Chronicler said. \u201cYou would just do something else. He gives you the flower, and you just sell it.\u201d\nBast shook his head. \u201cThe Cthaeh would know. You can\u2019t second-guess a thing that knows your future. Say you sell the flower to the prince. He uses the flower to heal his betrothed. A year later she catches him diddling the chambermaid, hangs herself in disgrace, and her father launches an attack to avenge her honor.\u201d Bast spread his hands helplessly. \u201cYou still get civil war.\u201d\n\u201cBut the young man who sold the flower stays safe.\u201d\n\u201cProbably not,\u201d Bast said grimly. \u201cMore likely he gets drunk as a lord, catches the pox, then knocks over a lamp and sets half the city on fire.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re just making things up to prove your point,\u201d Chronicler said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not actually proving anything.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do I need to prove anything to you?\u201d Bast asked. \u201cWhy would I care\nwhat you think? Be happy in your silly little ignorance. I\u2019m doing you a favor by not telling you the truth.\u201d\n\u201cWhat truth is that?\u201d Chronicler said, plainly irritated.\nBast gave a weary sigh, and looked up at Chronicler, his expression utterly empty of all hope. \u201cI would rather fight Haliax himself,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d rather face all the Chandrian together than have ten words of conversation with the Cthaeh.\u201d\nThis gave Chronicler a bit of a pause. \u201cThey\u2019d kill you,\u201d he said. Something in his voice made it a question.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Bast said. \u201cEven so.\u201d\nChronicler stared at the dark-haired man sitting across from him, wrapped in a rag blanket. \u201cStories taught you to fear the Cthaeh,\u201d he said, disgust plain", "in his voice. \u201cAnd that fear is making you stupid.\u201d\nBast shrugged, his empty eyes drifting back to the nonexistent fire. \u201cYou\nbore me, manling.\u201d\nChronicler stood up, stepped forward, and slapped Bast hard across the\nface.\nBast\u2019s head rocked to the side, and for a moment he seemed too shocked to\nmove. Then he came to his feet in a blur of motion, blanket flying from his shoulders. He grabbed Chronicler roughly by the throat, teeth bared, his eyes a deep, unbroken blue.\nChronicler looked him squarely in the eye. \u201cThe Cthaeh set all of this in motion,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cIt knew you would attack me, and terrible things will come of it.\u201d\nBast\u2019s furious expression went stiff, his eyes widening. The tension left his shoulders as he let go of Chronicler\u2019s throat. He started to sink back down onto the cushions of the couch.\nChronicler drew back his arm and slapped him again. If anything, the sound was even louder than before.\nBast bared his teeth again, then stopped. His eyes darted to Chronicler, then away.\n\u201cThe Cthaeh knows you fear it,\u201d Chronicler said. \u201cIt knows I would use that knowledge against you. It\u2019s still manipulating you. If you don\u2019t attack me, terrible things will come of it.\u201d\nBast froze as if paralyzed, trapped halfway between standing and sitting. \u201cAre you listening to me?\u201d Chronicler said. \u201cAre you finally awake?\u201d Bast looked up at the scribe with an expression of confused amazement. A\nbright red mark was blossoming on his cheek. He nodded, sinking slowly back onto the couch.\nChronicler drew back his arm. \u201cWhat will you do if I hit you again?\u201d \u201cBeat ten colors of guts out of you,\u201d Bast said earnestly.\nChronicler nodded and sat back down on his couch. \u201cI will, for the sake of\nargument, accept that the Cthaeh knows the future. That means it can control many things.\u201d He raised a finger. \u201cBut not everything. The fruit you ate today was still sweet in your mouth, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\nBast nodded slowly.\n\u201cIf the Cthaeh is as malicious as you say, it would harm you in every way possible. But it cannot. It could not keep you from making your Reshi laugh this morning. It could not keep you from enjoying the sun on your face or", "kissing the rosy cheeks of farmers\u2019 daughters, could it?\u201d\nA flicker of a grin found Bast\u2019s face. \u201cI kissed more than that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat,\u201d Chronicler said firmly, \u201cis my point. It cannot poison every thing\nwe do.\u201d\nBast looked thoughtful, then sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re right in a way,\u201d he said. \u201cBut\nonly an idiot sits in a burning house and thinks everything is fine because fruit is still sweet.\u201d\nChronicler made a point of looking around the room. \u201cThe inn doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s on fire to me.\u201d\nBast looked at him incredulously. \u201cThe whole world is burning down,\u201d he said. \u201cOpen your eyes.\u201d\nChronicler frowned. \u201cEven ignoring everything else,\u201d he said, bulling ahead. \u201cFelurian let him go. She knew he\u2019d spoken with the Cthaeh, surely she wouldn\u2019t have loosed him on the world unless she had some way to guard against its influence.\u201d\nBast\u2019s eyes brightened at the thought, then dimmed almost immediately. He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for depth in a shallow stream,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t follow you,\u201d Chronicler demanded. \u201cWhat possible reason could\nshe have for letting him go if he was truly dangerous?\u201d\n\u201cReason?\u201d Bast asked, dark amusement coloring his voice. \u201cNo reason.\nShe\u2019s got nothing to do with reason. She let him go because it pleased her pride. She wanted him to go out into the mortal world and sing her praises. Tell stories about her. Pine for her. That\u2019s why she let him leave.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve already told you. My folk are not famous for our good decisions.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Chronicler said. \u201cOr perhaps she simply recognized the futility of trying to second-guess the Cthaeh.\u201d He made a nonchalant gesture. \u201cIf whatever you\u2019re going to do is wrong, you might as well do whatever you want.\u201d\nBast sat quietly for a long moment. Then he nodded, faintly at first, then more firmly. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said. \u201cIf everything is going to end in tears anyway, I should do what I want.\u201d\nBast looked around the room, then came suddenly to his feet. After a moment\u2019s searching, he found a thick cloak crumpled on the floor. He gave it a vigorous shake and wrapped it around his shoulders before heading to the window. Then he stopped, came back to the couch, and rummaged in the cushions until he found a bottle of wine.\nChronicler looked puzzled. \u201cWhat are you doing? Are you going back to", "Shep\u2019s wake?\u201d\nBast paused on his way back to the window, seeming almost surprised to\nsee Chronicler still standing there. \u201cI am going about my business,\u201d he said tucking the bottle of wine under his arm. He opened the window and swung one foot outside. \u201cDon\u2019t wait up.\u201d\nKvothe stepped briskly into his room, closing the door behind himself.\nHe moved about busily. He cleared the cold ashes from the fireplace and\nset new wood in its place, sparking the fire to life with a fat red sulfur match. He fetched a second blanket and spread it over his narrow bed. Frowning slightly, he picked up the crumpled piece of paper from where it had fallen to the floor and returned it to the top of his desk where it sat next to the two other crumpled sheets.\nThen, moving almost reluctantly, he made his way to the foot of his bed. Taking a deep breath, he wiped his hands on his pants and knelt in front of the dark chest that sat there. He rested both hands on the curved lid and closed his eyes, as if listening for something. His shoulders shifted as he tugged against the lid.\nNothing happened. Kvothe opened his eyes. His mouth made a grim line. His hands moved again, pulling harder, straining for a long moment before giving up.\nExpressionless, Kvothe stood and walked to the window that overlooked the woods behind the inn. He slid it open and leaned out, reaching down with both hands. Then he drew himself back inside, clutching a slender wooden box.\nBrushing away a coating of dust and spiderwebs, he opened the box. Inside lay a key of dark iron and a key of bright copper. Kvothe knelt in front of the chest again and fit the copper key into the iron lock. With slow precision he turned it: left, then right, then left again, listening carefully to the faint clicks of some mechanism inside.\nThen he lifted the iron key and fit it into the copper plate. This key he did not turn. He slid it deep into the lock, brought it halfway out, then pushed it back before drawing it free in a smooth, quick motion.\nAfter replacing the keys in their box, he put his hands back on the sides of\n \nthe lid in the same position as before. \u201cOpen,\u201d he said under his breath. \u201cOpen, damn you. Edro.\u201d\nHe lifted, his back and shoulders tensing with the effort of it.\nThe lid of the chest didn\u2019t budge. Kvothe gave a long sigh and leaned forward until his forehead pressed against the cool dark wood. As the air rushed out of him, his shoulders sagged, leaving him looking small and wounded, terribly tired and older than his years.\nHis expression, however, showed no surprise, no grief. It was merely resigned. It was the expression of a man who has finally received bad news he\u2019d already known was on the way.", "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-TWO\nElderberry\nIT WAS A BAD night to be caught in the open.\nThe clouds had rolled in late, like a grey sheet pulled across the sky. The\nwind was chill and gusty, with fits and starts of rain that spattered down heavily before fading into drizzle.\nFor all this, the two soldiers camped in a thicket near the road seemed to be enjoying themselves. They\u2019d found a woodcutter\u2019s stash and built their fire so high and hot that the occasional gust of rain did little more than make it spit and hiss.\nThe two men were talking loudly, laughing the wild, braying laughter of men too drunk to care about the weather.\nEventually a third man emerged from the dark trees, stepping delicately over the trunk of a nearby fallen tree. He was wet, if not soaked, and his dark hair was plastered flat to his head. When the soldiers saw him, they lifted their bottles and called out an enthusiastic greeting.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t know if you\u2019d make it,\u201d the blonde soldier said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shit night. But it\u2019s only fair you get your third.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re wet through,\u201d said the bearded one, lifting up a narrow yellow bottle. \u201cSuck on this. It\u2019s some fruit thing, but it kicks like a pony.\u201d\n\u201cYours is girly piss,\u201d the blonde soldier said, holding up his own. \u201cHere. Now this here is a man\u2019s drink.\u201d\nThe third man looked back and forth as if unable to decide. Finally he lifted a finger, pointing at one bottle then the other as he began to chant.\nMaple. Maypole. Catch and carry. Ash and Ember. Elderberry.\nHe ended pointing at the yellow bottle, then gripped it by the neck and", "lifted to his lips. He took a long, slow drink, his throat working silently. \u201cHey there,\u201d said the bearded soldier. \u201cSave a bit!\u201d\nBast lowered the bottle and licked his lips. He gave a dry, humorless\nchuckle. \u201cYou got the right bottle,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s elderberry.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re nowhere near as chatty as you were this morning,\u201d the blonde\nsoldier said, cocking his head to one side. \u201cYou look like your dog died. Is everything alright?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bast said. \u201cNothing\u2019s alright.\u201d\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t our fault if he figured it out,\u201d the blonde one said quickly. \u201cWe waited a bit after you left, just like you said. But we\u2019d been sitting for hours already. Thought you were never going to leave.\u201d\n\u201cHell,\u201d the bearded man said, irritated. \u201cDoes he know? He throw you out?\u201d\nBast shook his head and tipped the bottle back again.\n\u201cThen you ain\u2019t got nothing to complain of.\u201d The blonde soldier rubbed the side of his head, scowling. \u201cSilly bastard gave me a lump or two.\u201d\n\u201cHe got it back with some to spare.\u201d The bearded soldier grinned, rubbing his thumb across his knuckles. \u201cHe\u2019ll be pissing blood tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cSo it\u2019s all good at the end,\u201d the blonde soldier said philosophically, lurching unsteadily as he waved his bottle a little too dramatically. \u201cYou got to skin your knuckles. I got a drink of something lovely. And we all made a heavy penny. Everyone\u2019s happy. Everyone gets what they wanted most.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get what I wanted,\u201d Bast said flatly.\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d the bearded soldier said, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a purse that made a weighty chink as he bounced it in his palm. \u201cGrab a piece of fire and we\u2019ll divvy this up.\u201d\nBast looked around the circle of firelight, making no move to take a seat. Then he began to chant again as he pointed at things randomly: a nearby stone, a log, a hatchet . . .\nFallow farrow. Ash and oak. Bide and borrow. Chimney smoke.\nHe ended pointing at the fire. He stepped close, stooped low, and pulled out a branch longer than his arm. The far end was a solid knot of glowing", "coal.\n\u201cHell, you\u2019re drunker than I am,\u201d the bearded soldier guffawed. \u201cThat\u2019s\nnot what I meant when I said grab a piece of fire.\u201d\nThe blonde soldier rolled with laughter.\nBast looked down at the two men. After a moment he began to laugh too. It\nwas a terrible sound, jagged and joyless. It was no human laugh. \u201cHoy,\u201d the bearded man interrupted sharply, his expression no longer\namused. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d\nIt began to rain again, a gust of wind spattering heavy drops against Bast\u2019s\nface. His eyes were dark and intent. There was another gust of wind that made the end of the branch flare a brilliant orange.\nThe hot coal traced a glowing arc through the air as Bast began to point it back and forth between the two men, chanting:\nBarrel. Barley. Stone and stave. Wind and water. Misbehave.\nBast finished with the burning branch pointing at the bearded man. His teeth were red in the firelight. His expression was nothing like a smile.", "EPILOGUE\nA Silence of Three Parts\nIT WAS NIGHT AGAIN. The Waystone Inn lay in silence, and it was a silence of three parts.\nThe most obvious part was a hollow, echoing quiet, made by things that were lacking. If there had been a steady rain it would have drummed against the roof, sluiced the eaves, and washed the silence slowly out to sea. If there had been lovers in the beds of the inn, they would have sighed and moaned and shamed the silence into being on its way. If there had been music ... but no, of course there was no music. In fact there were none of these things, and so the silence remained.\nOutside the Waystone, the noise of distant revelry blew faintly through the trees. A strain of fiddle. Voices. Stomping boots and clapping hands. But the sound was slender as a thread, and a shift in the wind broke it, leaving only rustling leaves and something almost like the far-off shrieking of an owl. That faded too, leaving nothing but the second silence, waiting like an endless indrawn breath.\nThe third silence was not an easy thing to notice. If you listened for an hour, you might begin to feel it in the chill metal of a dozen locks turned tight to keep the night away. It lay in rough clay jugs of cider and the hollow taproom gaps where chairs and tables ought to be. It was in the mottling ache of bruises that bloomed across a body, and it was in the hands of the man who wore the bruises as he rose stiffly from his bed, teeth clenched against the pain.\nThe man had true-red hair, red as flame. His eyes were dark and distant, and he moved with the subtle certainty of a thief in the night. He made his way downstairs. There, behind the tightly shuttered windows, he lifted his hands like a dancer, shifted his weight, and slowly took one single perfect step.\nThe Waystone was his, just as the third silence was his. This was appropriate, as it was the greatest silence of the three, wrapping the others inside itself. It was deep and wide as autumn\u2019s ending. It was heavy as a great", "river-smooth stone. It was the patient, cut-flower sound of a man who is waiting to die."], "CHAPTER FORTY-NINE": [""], "CHAPTER FIFTY": ["CHAPTER FIFTY\nChasing the Wind\nI GAVE MY ADMISSIONS TILE to Fela, telling her I hoped it brought her luck. And so the winter term came to an end.\nSuddenly three-quarters of my life simply disappeared. I had no classes to occupy my time, no shifts in the Medica to fill. I could no longer check out materials from Stocks, use tools in the Fishery, or enter the Archives.\nAt first it wasn\u2019t so bad. The midwinter pageantry was wonderfully distracting, and without the worry of work and study I was free to enjoy myself and spend time in the company of my friends.\nThen spring term started. My friends were still there, but they were busy with their own studies. I found myself crossing the river more and more. Denna was still nowhere to be found, but Deoch and Stanchion were always willing to share a drink and some idle gossip.\nThrepe was there too, and while he occasionally pressed me to attend a dinner at his house, I could tell his heart wasn\u2019t in it. My trial hadn\u2019t pleased people on this side of the river either, and they were still telling stories about it. I wouldn\u2019t be welcome in any respectable social circle for a great long time, if ever.\nI toyed with the idea of leaving the University. I knew people would forget about the trial more quickly if I wasn\u2019t around. But where would I go? The only thought that came to mind was heading off to Yll with the vain hope of finding Denna. But I knew that was nothing but foolishness.\nSince I didn\u2019t need to save money for tuition, I went to repay Devi. But for the first time ever, I wasn\u2019t able to find her. Over the course of several days I grew increasingly nervous. I even slid several apologetic notes under her door until I heard from Mola that she was taking a holiday and would be returning soon.\n \nDays passed. And I sat idle as winter slowly withdrew from the University. Frost left the corners of windowpanes, drifts of snow dwindled, and trees began to show their first greening buds. Eventually Simmon caught his first glimpse of bare leg beneath a flowing dress and declared spring had officially arrived.\nOne afternoon as I sat drinking metheglin with Stanchion, Threpe came through the door practically bubbling with excitement. He whisked me off to a private table on the second tier, looking ready to burst with whatever news he was carrying.\nThrepe folded his hands on the tabletop. \u201cSince we haven\u2019t had much luck finding you a local patron, I started casting my nets farther afield. It\u2019s nice to have a local patron. But if you have the support of a properly influential lord, it hardly matters where he lives.\u201d\nI nodded. My troupe had ranged all over the four corners under the protection of Lord Greyfallow\u2019s name.\nThrepe grinned. \u201cHave you ever been to Vintas?\u201d\n\u201cPossibly,\u201d I said. Then seeing his puzzled look, I explained, \u201cI traveled quite a bit when I was young. I can\u2019t remember if we ever made it that far east.\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cDo you know who the Maer Alveron is?\u201d\nI did, but I could tell Threpe was bursting to tell me himself. \u201cI seem to remember something . . .\u201d I said vaguely.\nThrepe grinned. \u201cYou know the expression \u2018rich as the King of Vint?\u2019 \u201d I nodded.\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s him. His great-great-grandfathers were the kings of Vint,\nback before the empire stomped in, converting everyone to the iron law and the Book of the Path. If not for a few quirks of fate a dozen generations back, Alveron would be the royal family of Vintas, not the Calanthis, and my friend the Maer would be the king.\u201d\n\u201cYour friend?\u201d I said appreciatively. \u201cYou know Maer Alveron?\u201d\nThrepe made a vacillating gesture.\u201cFriend may be stretching things a little,\u201d he admitted. \u201cWe\u2019ve been corresponding for some years, exchanging news from our different corners of the world, doing each other a favor or two. It would be more appropriate to say we\u2019re acquainted.\u201d\n\u201cAn impressive acquaintance. What is he like?\u201d\n\u201cHis letters are quite polite. Never a bit snobby even though he does stand quite a good rank above me,\u201d Threpe said modestly. \u201cHe\u2019s every bit a king", "except for the title and crown, you know. When Vintas formed, his family refused to surrender any of their plenary powers. That means the Maer has the authority to do most anything King Roderic himself can do: grant titles, raise an army, coin money, levy taxes\u2014\u201d\nThrepe shook his head sharply. \u201cAh, I forget what I\u2019m doing,\u201d he said as he began to search his pockets. \u201cI received a letter from him only yesterday.\u201d He produced a piece of paper, unfolded it, then cleared his throat and read:\nI know you are knee-deep in poets and musicians out there, and I am rather in need of a young man who is good with words. I cannot find anyone to suit me here in Severen. And, everything said, I would prefer the best.\nHe should be good with words above all, perhaps a musician of some sort. After that, I would desire him to be clever, well-spoken, mannerly, educated, and discreet. On reading this list you may see why I have had no luck finding such a one for myself. If you happen to know a man of this rare sort, encourage him to call on me.\nI would tell you what use I intend to put him to, but the matter is of a private nature. . . .\nThrepe studied the letter for a moment or two. \u201cIt goes on for a bit. Then he says, \u2018As to the matter I mentioned before, I am in some haste. If there is no one suitable in Imre, please send me a letter by post. If you happen to send someone my way, encourage him to make speed.\u2019 \u201d Threpe\u2019s eyes scanned the paper for a moment more, his lips moving silently. \u201cThat\u2019s all of it,\u201d he said finally, and tucked it back into a pocket. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\n\u201cYou do me a great\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes.\u201d He waved a hand impatiently. \u201cYou\u2019re flattered. Skip all that.\u201d He leaned forward seriously. \u201cWill you do it? Will your studies,\u201d he made a dismissive gesture westward, toward the University, \u201cpermit an absence of a season or so?\u201d\nI cleared my throat. \u201cI\u2019ve actually been considering taking my studies abroad for a time.\u201d\nThe count burst into a wide grin and thumped the arm of his chair. \u201cGood!\u201d he laughed. \u201cI thought I was going to have to pry you out of your precious University like a penny from a dead shim\u2019s fist! This is a wonderful opportunity, you realize. Once in a lifetime, really.\u201d He gave me a sly wink.", "\u201cBesides, a young man like yourself would be hard-pressed to find a better patron than a man who\u2019s richer than the king of Vint.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s some truth to that,\u201d I admitted aloud. Silently, I thought, Could I hope for better assistance in my search for the Amyr?\n\u201cThere\u2019s much truth to that,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cHow soon can you be ready to leave?\u201d\nI shrugged. \u201cTomorrow?\u201d\nThrepe raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou don\u2019t give much time for the dust to settle, do you?\u201d\n\u201cHe said he was in haste, and I\u2019d rather be early than late.\u201d\n\u201cTrue. True.\u201d He drew a silver gear-watch from his pocket, looked at it, then sighed as he clicked it closed. \u201cI\u2019ll have to miss some sleep tonight drafting a letter of introduction for you.\u201d\nI glanced at the window. \u201cIt\u2019s not even dark yet,\u201d I said. \u201cHow long do you expect it to take?\u201d\n\u201cHush,\u201d he said crossly. \u201cI write slowly, especially when I\u2019m sending a letter to someone as important as the Maer. Plus I have to describe you, no easy task by itself.\u201d\n\u201cLet me help you then,\u201d I said. \u201cNo sense losing sleep on my account.\u201d I smiled. \u201cBesides, if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m well-versed in it\u2019s my own good qualities.\u201d\nThe next day I made a round of hasty good-byes to everyone I knew at the University. I received heartfelt handshakes from Wilem and Simmon and a cheerful wave from Auri.\nKilvin grunted without looking up from his engraving and told me to write down any ideas I might have for the ever-burning lamp while I was away. Arwyl gave me a long, penetrating look through his spectacles and told me there would be a place for me in the Medica when I returned.\nElxa Dal was refreshing after the other masters\u2019 reserved responses. He laughed and admitted he was a little jealous of my freedom. He advised me to take full advantage of every reckless opportunity that presented itself. If a thousand miles wasn\u2019t enough to keep my escapades secret, he said, then nothing would.\n \nI had no luck finding Elodin, and settled for sliding a note under the door of his office. Though since he never seemed to use the place, it might be months before he found it.\nI bought a new travelsack and a few other things a sympathist should never be without: wax, string and wire, hook-needle and gut. My clothes were easy to pack, as I didn\u2019t own many.\nAs I loaded my pack, I slowly realized I couldn\u2019t take everything with me. This came as something of a shock. For so many years I\u2019d been able to carry everything I\u2019ve owned, usually with a hand to spare.\nBut since I\u2019d moved into this small garret room, I\u2019d begun gathering oddments and half-finished projects. I now had the luxury of two blankets. There were pages of notes, a circular piece of half-inscribed tin from the Fishery, a broken gear-clock I\u2019d taken to pieces to see if I could put it back together again.\nI finished loading my travelsack, then packed everything else into the trunk that sat at the foot of my bed. A few worn tools, a broken piece of slate I used for ciphering, a small wooden box with the handful of small treasures Auri had given me. . . .\nThen I went downstairs and asked Anker if he would mind stowing my possessions in the basement until I returned. He admitted a little guiltily that before I\u2019d started sleeping there, the tiny, slant-ceilinged room had been empty for years, and only used for storage. He was willing to leave it unrented if I promised to continue our current room-for-music arrangement after I returned. I gladly agreed, and swinging my lute case onto my shoulder I headed out the door.\nI wasn\u2019t entirely surprised to find Elodin on Stonebridge. Very little about the Master Namer surprised me these days. He sat on the waist-high stone lip of the bridge, swinging his bare feet over the hundred-foot drop to the river below.\n\u201cHello Kvothe,\u201d he said without turning his eyes from the churning water.\n\u201cHello Master Elodin,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to be leaving the University for a term or two.\u201d\n\u201cAre you really afraid?\u201d I noticed a whisper of amusement in his quiet,\n \nresonant voice.\nIt took me a moment to realize what he was referring to. \u201cIt\u2019s just a figure\nof speech.\u201d\n\u201cThe figures of our speaking are like pictures of names. Vague, weak\nnames, but names nonetheless. Be mindful of them.\u201d He looked up at me. \u201cSit with me for a moment.\u201d\nI started to excuse myself, then hesitated. He was my sponsor, after all. I set down my lute and travelsack on the flat stone of the bridge. A fond smile came over Elodin\u2019s boyish face and he slapped the stone parapet next to himself with the flat of his hand, offering me a seat.\nI looked over the edge with a hint of anxiety. \u201cI\u2019d rather not, Master Elodin.\u201d\nHe gave me a reproachful look. \u201cCaution suits an arcanist. Assurance suits a namer. Fear does not suit either. It does not suit you.\u201d He slapped the stone again, more firmly this time.\nI carefully climbed onto the parapet and swung my feet over the edge. The view was spectacular, exhilarating.\n\u201cCan you see the wind?\u201d\nI tried. For a moment it seemed as if... No. It was nothing. I shook my head.\nElodin shrugged nonchalantly, though I sensed a hint of disappointment. \u201cThis is a good place for a namer. Tell me why.\u201d\nI looked around. \u201cWide wind, strong water, old stone.\u201d\n\u201cGood answer.\u201d I heard genuine pleasure in his voice. \u201cBut there is another reason. Stone, water, and wind are other places too. What makes this different?\u201d\nI thought for a moment, looked around, shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cAnother good answer. Remember it.\u201d\nI waited for him to continue. When he didn\u2019t, I asked, \u201cWhat makes this a\ngood place?\u201d\nHe looked out over the water for a long time before he answered. \u201cIt is an\nedge,\u201d he said at last. \u201cIt is a high place with a chance of falling. Things are more easily seen from edges. Danger rouses the sleeping mind. It makes some things clear. Seeing things is a part of being a namer.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about falling?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cIf you fall, you fall,\u201d Elodin shrugged. \u201cSometimes falling teaches us things too. In dreams you often fall before you wake.\u201d", "We were both silent in our thoughts for a while. I closed my eyes and tried to listen for the name of the wind. I heard the water below, felt the stone of the bridge beneath my palms. Nothing.\n\u201cDo you know what they used to say when a student left the University for a term?\u201d Elodin asked.\nI shook my head.\n\u201cThey said he was chasing the wind,\u201d he chuckled.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard the expression.\u201d\n\u201cHave you? What did it seem to mean?\u201d\nI took a moment to choose my words. \u201cIt had a frivolous flavor. As if\nstudents were running around to no good purpose.\u201d\nElodin nodded. \u201cMost students leave for frivolous reasons, or to pursue\nfrivolous things.\u201d He leaned forward to look straight down at the river below. \u201cBut that was not always the meaning of it.\u201d\n\u201cNo?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d He sat back up again. \u201cLong ago, when all students aspired to be namers, things were different.\u201d He licked a finger and held it to the air. \u201cThe name most fledgling namers were encouraged to find was that of the wind. After they found that name, their sleeping minds were roused and finding other names was easier.\n\u201cBut some students had trouble finding the name of the wind. There were too few edges here, too little risk. So they would go off into the wild, uneducated lands. They would seek their fortunes, have adventures, hunt for secrets and treasure. . . .\u201d He looked at me. \u201cBut they were really looking for the name of the wind.\u201d\nOur conversation paused as someone came onto the bridge. It was a man with dark hair and a pinched face. He watched us from the corner of his eye without turning his head, and as he walked behind us I tried not to think how easy it would be for him to push me off the bridge.\nThen he was past us. Elodin gave a weary sigh and continued. \u201cThings have changed. There are even fewer edges now than there were before. The world is less wild. There are fewer magics, more secrets, and only a handful of people who know the name of the wind.\u201d\n\u201cYou know it, don\u2019t you?\u201d I asked.\nElodin nodded. \u201cIt changes from place to place, but I know how to listen for its changing shape.\u201d He laughed and clapped me on the shoulder. \u201cYou should go. Chase the wind. Do not be afraid of the occasional risk.\u201d He", "smiled. \u201cIn moderation.\u201d\nI swung my legs around, hopped off the thick wall, and resettled my lute\nand travelsack over my shoulder. But as I started toward Imre, Elodin\u2019s voice stopped me. \u201cKvothe.\u201d\nI turned and saw Elodin lean forward over the side of the bridge. He grinned like a schoolboy. \u201cSpit for luck.\u201d\nDevi opened the door for me and widened her eyes in shock. \u201cMy goodness,\u201d she said, pressing a piece of paper dramatically to her chest. I recognized it as one of the notes I left under her door. \u201cIt\u2019s my secret admirer.\u201d\n\u201cI was trying to pay off my loan,\u201d I said. \u201cI made four trips.\u201d\n\u201cThe walk is good for you,\u201d she said with a cheerful lack of sympathy as she motioned me inside, bolting the door behind me. The room smelled of. . .\nI sniffed. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d I asked.\nHer expression went rueful. \u201cIt was supposed to be pear.\u201d\nI lay down my lute case and travelsack and took a seat at her desk. Despite\nmy best intentions, my eyes were drawn to the charred black ring. Devi tossed her strawberry-blonde hair and met my eye. \u201cCare for a\nrematch?\u201d she asked, her mouth curving. \u201cI can still take you, gram or no gram. I can take you while I\u2019m dead asleep.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll admit to being curious,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I should tend to business instead.\u201d\n\u201cVery well,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you really going to pay me off entire? Have you finally found yourself a patron?\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cHowever, I have had a remarkable opportunity arise. The chance to get a fine patron indeed.\u201d I paused. \u201cIn Vintas.\u201d\nShe raised an eyebrow. \u201cThat\u2019s a long ways off,\u201d she said pointedly. \u201cI\u2019m glad you stopped to settle your debt before jaunting off to the other side of the world. Who knows when you\u2019ll be back.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d I said. \u201cHowever. I find myself in a bit of an odd place, financially speaking.\u201d\nDevi was already shaking her head before I finished speaking. \u201cAbsolutely not. You\u2019re already into me for nine talents. I am not loaning you more money the day you leave town.\u201d\n \nI held up my hands defensively. \u201cYou misunderstand,\u201d I said. I opened my purse and spilled talents and jots onto the table. Denna\u2019s ring tumbled out too, and I stopped it before it could roll off the edge of the table.\nI gestured to the pile of coins in front of me, slightly more than thirteen talents. \u201cThis is all the money I have in the world,\u201d I said. \u201cWith it, I need to get myself to Severen with fair speed. A thousand miles with some to spare. That means passage on at least one ship. Food. Lodging. Money for coaches or the use of a post note.\u201d\nAs I listed each of these things, I slid an appropriate amount of money from one side of the desk to the other. \u201cWhen I finally arrive in Severen, I will need to buy myself clothes that will allow me to move among the court without looking like the ragged musician I am.\u201d I slid more coins.\nI pointed at the few straggling coins remaining. \u201cThis does not leave me enough to settle my debt with you.\u201d\nDevi watched me over her steepled fingers. \u201cI see,\u201d she said seriously. \u201cWe must discover some alternate method for you to square your debt.\u201d\n\u201cMy thought is this,\u201d I said. \u201cI can leave you with collateral against my eventual return.\u201d\nHer eyes flickered down to the slender, dark shape of my lute case. \u201cNot my lute,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cI need that.\u201d\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou\u2019ve always said you have no collateral.\u201d \u201cI have a few things,\u201d I said, rummaging around in my travelsack and\nbrought up a book.\nDevi\u2019s eyes lit up. Then she read the spine. \u201cRhetoric and Logic?\u201d She\nmade a face.\n\u201cI feel the same way,\u201d I said. \u201cBut it\u2019s worth something. Especially to me.\nAlso . . .\u201d I reached into the pocket of my cloak and brought out my hand lamp. \u201cI have this. A sympathy lamp of my own design. It has a focused beam and a graded switch.\u201d\nDevi picked it up off the desk, nodding to herself. \u201cI remember this,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore, you said you couldn\u2019t give it up because of a promise you\u2019d made to Kilvin. Has that changed?\u201d\nI gave a bright smile that was two-thirds lie. \u201cThat promise is actually what makes that lamp the perfect piece of collateral,\u201d I said. \u201cIf you take this lamp to Kilvin, I have every confidence he will pay a lavish sum just to get it out of . . .\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cUnsavory hands.\u201d\nDevi flicked the switch idly with her thumb, spinning it from dim to bright", "and back again. \u201cAnd I imagine this would be a stipulation you require? That I return it to Kilvin?\u201d\n\u201cYou know me so well,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost embarrassing.\u201d\nDevi set the lamp back on the table next to my book and took a slow breath through her nose. \u201cA book that\u2019s only valuable to you,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd a lamp that\u2019s only valuable to Kilvin.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThis is not an appealing offer.\u201d\nI felt a pang as I reached to my shoulder and unclasped my talent pipes and slid them onto the table as well. \u201cThose are silver,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd hard to come by. They\u2019ll get you into the Eolian free, too.\u201d\n\u201cI know what they are.\u201d Devi picked them up and looked them over with a sharp eye. Then she pointed. \u201cYou had a ring.\u201d\nI froze. \u201cThat\u2019s not mine to give.\u201d\nDevi laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s in your pocket, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She snapped her fingers. \u201cCome now. Let me see it.\u201d\nI brought it out of my pocket, but I didn\u2019t hand it over. \u201cI went through a lot of trouble for this,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s the ring Ambrose took from a friend of mine. I\u2019m just waiting to return it to her.\u201d\nDevi sat silently, her hand outstretched. After a moment I put the ring onto her palm.\nShe held it close to the lamp and leaned forward, squinting one eye closed on her pixie face. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice stone,\u201d she said appreciatively.\n\u201cThe setting\u2019s new,\u201d I said miserably.\nDevi set the ring carefully on top of the book next to my pipes and hand lamp. \u201cHere is the deal,\u201d she said. \u201cI will keep these items as collateral against your current debt of nine talents. This will last for the space of one year.\u201d\n\u201cA year and a day,\u201d I said.\nA smile curved the corner of her mouth. \u201cHow storybook of you. Very well. This will postpone your repayment for a year and a day. If you have not repaid me by the end of that time, these items will be forfeit, and our debt will be cleared.\u201d Her smile went sharp. \u201cThough I may be persuaded to return them in exchange for certain information.\u201d\nI heard the belling tower in the distance and gave a deep sigh. I didn\u2019t have much time for bargaining, as I was already late for my meeting with Threpe. \u201cFine,\u201d I said, irritated. \u201cBut the ring will be kept somewhere safe. You can\u2019t wear it until I\u2019ve defaulted.\u201d", "Devi frowned. \u201cYou don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI am not movable on this point,\u201d I said seriously. \u201cIt belongs to a friend. It is precious to her. I would not have her see it on someone else\u2019s hand. Not after everything I did to get it back from Ambrose.\u201d\nDevi said nothing, her pixie face set in a grim expression. I put on my own grim expression and met her eye. I do a good grim expression when I need to.\nA long moment of silence stretched between us. \u201cFine!\u201d she said at last.\nWe shook hands. \u201cA year and a day,\u201d I said.", ""], "CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE": ["CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE\nAll Wise Men Fear\nI STOPPED BY THE EOLIAN where Threpe was waiting for me, practically dancing with impatience. He had, he told me, found a boat heading downriver in less than an hour. What\u2019s more, he had already paid my way as far as Tarbean, where I should easily be able to find passage east.\nThe two of us hurried to the docks, arriving just as the ship was going through its final preparations. Threpe, red-faced and puffing from our brisk walk, hurried to give me a lifetime\u2019s worth of advice in the space of three minutes.\n\u201cThe Maer is old, old blood,\u201d he said. \u201cNot like most of the little nobility around these parts who can\u2019t tell you who their great-grandfathers are. So treat him with respect.\u201d\nI rolled my eyes. Why did everyone always expect me to behave so poorly?\n\u201cAnd remember,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look like you\u2019re chasing money, they\u2019ll see you as provincial. As soon as that happens no one will take you seriously. You\u2019re there to curry favor. That\u2019s the high-stakes game. Besides, fortune follows favor, as they say. If you get one, you\u2019ll have the other. It\u2019s like what Teccam wrote, \u2018The cost of a loaf is a simple thing, and so a loaf is often sought . . .\u2019 \u201d\n\u201c \u2018... but some things are past valuing: laughter, land, and love are never bought.\u2019\u201d I finished. It was actually a quote from Gregan the Lesser, but I didn\u2019t bother correcting him.\n\u201cHoy there!\u201d a tan, bearded man shouted to us from the deck of the ship. \u201cWe got one straggler we\u2019re waitin\u2019 on, and Captain\u2019s angry as an ugly whore. He swears he\u2019ll leave if he ain\u2019t here in two minutes. You\u2019d do well to be aboard by then.\u201d He wandered off without waiting for a reply.\n\u201cAddress him as your grace,\u201d Threpe continued as if we hadn\u2019t been interrupted. \u201cAnd remember: speak least if you would be most often heard. Oh!\u201d He drew a sealed letter from his breast pocket. \u201cHere\u2019s your letter of", "introduction. I may send another copy by post, just so he knows to expect you.\u201d\nI gave him a broad smile and gripped his arm. \u201cThank you, Denn,\u201d I said earnestly. \u201cFor everything. I appreciate all of this more than you know.\u201d\nThrepe waved the comment aside. \u201cI know you\u2019ll do splendidly. You\u2019re a clever boy. Mind that you find a good tailor when you get there. The fashions will be different. As they say: know a lady by her manner, a man by his cloth.\u201d\nI knelt and opened up my lute case. Moving the lute aside, I pressed the lid of the secret compartment and twisted it open. I slid Threpe\u2019s sealed letter inside, where it joined the hollow horn with Nina\u2019s drawing and a small sack of dried apple I had stowed there. There was nothing special about the dried apple, but in my opinion if you have a secret compartment in your lute case and don\u2019t use it to hide things, there is something terribly, terribly wrong with you.\nI snapped the clasps closed, refastening the lid, then stood and gathered up my belongings, ready to board the ship.\nThrepe gripped my shoulder suddenly. \u201cI almost forgot! Alveron mentioned in one of his letters that the young people in his court gamble. He thinks it\u2019s a deplorable habit, so stay clear of it. And remember, small thaws make great floods, so be twice wary of a slowly changing season.\u201d\nI saw someone running down the dock toward us. It was the pinch-faced man who had passed Elodin and me on Stonebridge earlier. He carried a cloth-wrapped package close under one arm.\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing that\u2019s their missing sailor,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cI\u2019d better get aboard.\u201d I gave Threpe a quick embrace and tried to get away before he could give me any more advice.\nBut he caught my sleeve as I turned. \u201cBe careful on your way there,\u201d he said, his expression anxious. \u201cRemember: There are three things all wise men fear: the sea in storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle man.\u201d\nThe sailor passed us and hit the gangplank running, unmindful of how the board jounced and clattered under his feet. I gave Threpe a reassuring smile and followed close on his heels. Two leathery men hauled up the plank, and I returned Threpe\u2019s final wave.\nOrders were shouted, men scrambled, and the ship began to move. I turned to face downriver, toward Tarbean, toward the sea.", ""], "CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO": ["CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO\nA Brief Journey\nMY ROUTE WAS A simple one. I would head downriver to Tarbean, through the Refting Strait, down the coast toward Junpui, then up the Arrand River. It was more roundabout than going overland, but better in the long run. Even if I were to purchase a post letter and change horses at every opportunity, it would still take me almost three span to reach Severen overland. And most of that time would be in southern Atur and the Small Kingdoms. Only priests and fools expected the roads in that part of the world to be safe.\nThe water route added several hundred miles to the distance traveled, but ships at sea need not mind the twistings and turnings of a road. And while a good horse can set a better pace than a ship, you can\u2019t ride a horse day and night without stopping to rest. The water route would take about a dozen days, depending on the weather.\nMy curiosity was also glad to take the sea route. I had never been on any water larger than a river. My only real concern was that I might become bored with nothing but wind, waves, and sailors for company.\nSeveral unfortunate complications arose during the trip.\nIn brief, there was a storm, piracy, treachery, and shipwreck, although not\nin that order. It also goes without saying that I did a great many things, some heroic, some ill-advised, some clever and audacious.\nOver the course of my trip I was robbed, drowned, and left penniless on the streets of Junpui. In order to survive I begged for crusts, stole a man\u2019s shoes, and recited poetry. The last should demonstrate more than all the rest how truly desperate my situation became.\nHowever, as these events have little to do with the heart of the story, I must\n \npass them over in favor of more important things. Simply said, it took me sixteen days to reach Severen. A bit longer than I had planned, but at no point during my journey was I ever bored.", ""], "CHAPTER FIFTY-THREE": ["CHAPTER FIFTY-THREE\nThe Sheer\nI LIMPED THROUGH THE GATES of Severen ragged, penniless, and hungry. I am no stranger to hunger. I know the countless hollow shapes it takes inside you. This particular hunger wasn\u2019t a terrible one. I\u2019d eaten two apples and some salt pork a day ago, so this hunger was merely painful. It wasn\u2019t the bad hunger that leaves you weak and trembling. I was safe from that for at least eight hours or so.\nOver the last two span everything I owned had been lost, destroyed, stolen, or abandoned. The only exception was my lute. Denna\u2019s marvelous case had paid for itself ten times during my trip. In addition to saving my life on one occasion, it had protected my lute, Threpe\u2019s letter of introduction, and Nina\u2019s invaluable drawing of the Chandrian.\nYou may notice I don\u2019t include any clothing on my list of possessions. There are two good reasons for this. The first is that you couldn\u2019t really call the grubby rags I wore clothing without stretching the truth to its breaking point. Secondly, I had stolen them, so it doesn\u2019t seem right to claim them as my own.\nThe most irritating was the loss of Fela\u2019s cloak. I\u2019d been forced to tear it up and use it for bandages in Junpui. Nearly as bad was the fact that my hard- won gram now lay somewhere deep below the cold, dark waters of the Centhe Sea.\nThe city of Severen was split into two unequal portions by a tall, white cliff. The majority of the living business of the city took place in the larger portion of the city at the foot of this cliff, aptly named the Sheer.\nAtop the Sheer was a much smaller piece of the city. It consisted mostly of estates and manor houses belonging to aristocracy and wealthy merchants.\n \nAlso present were the attendant number of tailors, liveries, theaters, and brothels necessary to provide for the needs of the upper class.\nThe stark cliff of white stone looked as if it had been thrust skyward to give the nobility a better view of the countryside. As it wandered off to the northeast and south, it lost height and stature, but where it bisected Severen, it was two hundred feet tall and steep as a garden wall.\nIn the center of the city, a wide peninsula of cliff jutted out from the Sheer. Perched on this outthrust piece of cliff was Maer Alveron\u2019s estate. Its pale stone walls were visible from anywhere in the city below. The effect was daunting, as if the Maer\u2019s ancestral home was peering down on you.\nSeeing it without a coin in my pocket or a decent set of clothes on my back was rather intimidating. I\u2019d planned to take Threpe\u2019s letter straight to the Maer despite my disheveled state, but looking up at the tall stone walls, I realized I probably wouldn\u2019t be let through the front door. I looked like a filthy beggar.\nI had few resources and even fewer options to choose from. With the exception of Ambrose some miles to the south in his father\u2019s barony, I didn\u2019t know a single soul in all of Vintas.\nI\u2019ve begged before, and I\u2019ve stolen. But only when I\u2019ve had no other options available to me. They are dangerous occupations and only a complete fool attempts them in an unfamiliar city, let alone an entirely new country. Here in Vintas, I didn\u2019t even know what laws I might be breaking.\nSo I gritted my teeth and took the only option available to me. I wandered barefoot through the cobblestone streets of Severen-Low until I found a pawn shop in one of the better parts of the city.\nI stood across the street for the better part of an hour, watching the people come and go, trying to think of some better option. But I simply didn\u2019t have one. So I removed Threpe\u2019s letter and Nina\u2019s painting from the secret compartment in my lute case, crossed the street, and pawned my lute and case for eight silver nobles and a span note.\nIf you\u2019ve led the sort of easy life that\u2019s never taken you to the pawners, let me explain. The note was a receipt of sorts, and with it, I could buy my lute back for the same amount of money, so long as I did it within eleven days. On the twelfth day it became the property of the pawnbroker who would undoubtedly turn around and sell it for ten times that amount.\nBack on the street, I hefted the coins. They seemed thin and insubstantial compared to Cealdish currency or the heavy Commonwealth pennies I was", "familiar with. Still, money spends the same the world round, and seven nobles bought me a fine suit of clothes of the sort a gentleman might wear, along with a pair of soft leather boots. What remained bought a haircut, shave, bath, and my first solid meal in three days. After that I was coin-poor again, but feeling much more sure of myself.\nStill, I knew it would be difficult to make my way to the Maer. Men with his degree of power live within layers of protection. There are customary, graceful ways to navigate these layers: introductions and audiences, messages and rings, calling cards and ass-kissing.\nBut with only eleven days to get my lute out of pawn, my time was too precious for that. I needed to make contact with Alveron quickly.\nSo I made my way to the foot of the Sheer and found a small caf\u00e9 that catered to a genteel clientele. I used one of my precious few remaining coins to buy a mug of chocolate and a seat with a view of the haberdasher\u2019s across the street.\nOver the next several hours I listened to the gossip that flows through such places. Even better, I won the trust of the clever young boy who worked at the caf\u00e9, waiting to refill my mug if I so desired. With his help and some casual eavesdropping, I learned a great deal about the Maer\u2019s court in a short amount of time.\nEventually the shadows grew longer, and I decided it was time to move. I called the boy over and pointed across the street. \u201cDo you see that gentleman? The one in the red vest?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know who it is?\u201d\n\u201cThe Esquire Bergon, if \u2019n it please you.\u201d\nI needed someone more important than that. \u201cHow about the cross-looking\nfellow in the awful yellow hat?\u201d\nThe boy hid a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s Baronet Pettur.\u201d\nPerfect. I stood and clapped Jim on the back. \u201cYou\u2019ll do well for yourself\nwith a memory like that. Keep well.\u201d I gave him ha\u2019penny and strolled to where the baronet stood, fingering a bolt of deep green velvet.\nIt goes without saying that in terms of social rank, there are none lower than the Edema Ruh. Even leaving aside my heritage, I was a landless commoner. This meant in terms of social standing the baronet was so high above me that if he were a star, I would not be able to see him with the naked eye. A person of my position should address him as \u201cmy lord,\u201d avoid eye", "contact, and bow deeply and humbly.\nTruth be told, a person of my social standing shouldn\u2019t speak to him at all. Things were different in the Commonwealth, of course. And the University\nitself was particularly egalitarian. But even there, nobility were still rich and powerful and well-connected. People like Ambrose would always run roughshod over folk like myself. And if things got difficult, he could always hush things up or bribe a judge to get himself out of trouble.\nBut I was in Vintas now. Here Ambrose wouldn\u2019t need to bribe the judge. If I\u2019d accidentally jostled the Baronet Pettur in the street while I was still barefoot and muddy, he could have horsewhipped me bloody, then called the constable to arrest me for being a public nuisance. The constable would have done it too, with a smile and a nod.\nLet me try to say this more succinctly. In the Commonwealth, the gentry are people with power and money. In Vintas, the gentry have power and money and privilege. Many rules simply do not apply to them.\nThat meant in Vintas, social rank was of utmost importance.\nThat meant if the baronet knew I was below him, he would lord it over me, quite literally.\nOn the other hand . . .\nAs I walked across the street toward the baronet, I straightened my shoulders and raised my chin a bit. I stiffened my neck and narrowed my eyes slightly. I looked around as if I owned the entire street, and it was currently something of a disappointment.\n\u201cBaronet Pettur?\u201d I said briskly.\nThe man looked up, smiling vaguely, as if he couldn\u2019t decide if he recognized me or not. \u201cYes?\u201d\nI made a curt gesture toward the Sheer. \u201cYou would be doing the Maer a great service if you would escort me to his estate as quickly as possible.\u201d I kept my expression stern, almost angry.\n\u201cWell, certainly.\u201d He sounded anything but certain. I could sense the questions, the excuses beginning to bubble up in him. \u201cW\u2014\u201d\nI fixed the baronet with my haughtiest stare. The Edema might be on the lowest rung of the social ladder, but there are no finer actors breathing. I had been raised on the stage, and my father could play a king so regal I\u2019d seen audiences doff their hats when he made his entrance.\nI made my eyes as hard as agates and looked the florid man up and down as if he were a horse I wasn\u2019t sure I cared to bet on. \u201cIf the matter were not", "urgent, I would never impose on you this way.\u201d I hesitated, then added a stiff, reluctant, \u201cSir.\u201d\nBaronet Pettur looked me in the eye. He was slightly off balance, but not nearly as much as I\u2019d hoped. Like most nobility, he was self-centered as a gyroscope, and the only thing keeping him from sniffing and looking down his nose at me was his uncertainty. He eyed me, trying to decide if he could risk offending me by asking my name and how we were acquainted.\nBut I still had a final trick to play. I brought out the thin, sharp smile the porter at the Grey Man had used when I had come calling on Denna all those months ago. As I\u2019d said, it was a good smile: gracious, polite, and more patronizing than if I\u2019d reached out and patted the man on the head like a dog.\nThe Baronet Pettur bore up under the weight of the smile for almost a full second. Then he cracked like an egg, his shoulders rounding a bit, and his manner becoming ever so slightly obsequious. \u201cAny service I can lend the Maer is a service I am glad to render,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease, allow me.\u201d He took the lead, heading toward the foot of the cliff.\nFollowing behind, I smiled.", ""], "CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR": ["CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR\nThe Messenger\nI MANAGED TO BLUFF AND fast-talk my way through the majority of the Maer\u2019s defenses. The Baronet Pettur helped me simply by his presence. Being escorted by a recognizable member of the nobility was enough to get me deep inside Alveron\u2019s estate. After that, he soon outlived his usefulness and I left him behind.\nOnce he was out of sight I put on my most impatient face, asked a busy servant for directions, and made it all the way to the outer doors of the Maer\u2019s audience chamber before I was stopped by an unassuming man in his middle years. He was portly, with a round face, and despite his fine clothes he looked like a grocer to me.\nIf not for the several hours I\u2019d spent gathering information in Severen-Low I might have made a terrible mistake and tried to bluff my way past this man, thinking him nothing more than a well-dressed servant.\nBut this was actually the person I was looking for: the Maer\u2019s manservant, Stapes. Though he looked like a grocer, he had the aura of true authority about him. His manner was quiet and certain, unlike the overbearing, brash one I had used to bully the baronet.\n\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d Stapes asked. His tone was perfectly polite, but there were other questions lurking beneath the surface of his words. Who are you? What are you doing here?\nI brought out Count Threpe\u2019s letter and handed it over with a slight bow. \u201cYou would be doing me a great service if you would convey this to the Maer,\u201d I said. \u201cHe is expecting me.\u201d\nStapes gave me a cool look, making it perfectly clear that if the Maer had been expecting me, he would have known about it ten days ago. He rubbed his chin as he looked me over, and I saw he wore a dull iron ring with gold letters scrolling across the surface.\nDespite his obvious misgivings, Stapes took the letter and disappeared through a set of double doors. I stood in the hallway for a nervous minute", "before he returned and ushered me inside, his manner still vaguely disapproving.\nWe moved through a short hallway, then came to a second set of doors flanked by armored guards. These weren\u2019t ceremonial guards of the sort you sometimes see in public, standing stiffly at attention, holding halberds. They wore the Maer\u2019s colors but beneath their sapphire and ivory were functional breastplates with steel rings and leather. Each man wore a long sword and a long knife. They eyed me seriously as I approached.\nThe Maer\u2019s manservant nodded to me, and one of the guards manhandled me in a quick, competent way, sliding his hands along my arms and legs and around my chest, searching for hidden weapons. I was suddenly very glad for some of the misfortunes on my trip, specifically the ones that had ended with me losing the pair of slender knives I\u2019d grown accustomed to wearing underneath my clothes.\nThe guard stepped back and nodded. Then Stapes gave me another irritated look and opened the inner door.\nInside, two men sat at a map-strewn table. One was tall and bald with the hard, weathered look of a veteran soldier. Next to him sat the Maer.\nAlveron was older than I had expected. He had a serious face, proud around the mouth and eyes. His well-trimmed salt-and-pepper beard had very little black left to it, but his hair was still full and thick. His eyes too, seemed to belie his age. They were clear grey, clever and piercing. They were not the eyes of an old man.\nThe Maer turned those eyes on me as I entered the room. He held Threpe\u2019s letter in one hand.\nI made a standard number three bow. \u201cThe Messenger\u201d as my father called it. Low and formal, as fitting the Maer\u2019s high station. Deferential, but not obsequious. Just because I tread heavily on propriety\u2019s toes doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t play the game when it\u2019s of use to me.\nThe Maer\u2019s eyes flickered down to the letter, then back up. \u201cKvothe, is it? You travel swiftly to arrive in such good time. I\u2019d not expected even a reply from the count so soon.\u201d\n\u201cI made all possible speed to put myself at your disposal, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d He looked me over carefully. \u201cAnd you seem to vindicate the count\u2019s opinion of your wit by making it all the way to my door with nothing but a sealed letter in your hand.\u201d\n\u201cI thought it best to present myself as soon as possible, your grace,\u201d I said", "neutrally. \u201cYour letter implied you were in some haste.\u201d\n\u201cAnd an impressive job you did of it too,\u201d Alveron said, glancing at the tall\nman sitting at the table next to him. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you say, Dagon?\u201d\n\u201cYes, your grace.\u201d Dagon looked at me with dark, dispassionate eyes. His\nface was hard and sharp and emotionless. I suppressed a shiver. Alveron glanced down at the letter again. \u201cThrepe certainly has some\nflattering things to say about you here,\u201d he said. \u201cWell-spoken. Charming. Most talented musician he\u2019s met in ten years. . . .\u201d\nThe Maer continued reading, then looked back up, his eyes shrewd. \u201cYou seem a bit young,\u201d he said hesitantly. \u201cYou\u2019re barely past twenty, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nI was a month past my sixteenth birthday. A fact I\u2019d pointedly omitted from the letter. \u201cI am young, your grace,\u201d I admitted, sidestepping the actual lie. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been making music since I was four.\u201d I spoke with quiet confidence, doubly glad of my new clothes. In my rags, I couldn\u2019t have helped but look like a starving urchin. As it was, I was well-dressed and tanned from my days at sea, and the lean lines of my face added years to my appearance.\nAlveron eyed me for a long, speculative moment, then nodded, apparently satisfied. \u201cVery well,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, I am rather busy at present. Would tomorrow be convenient for you?\u201d It wasn\u2019t really a question. \u201cHave you found lodgings in the city?\u201d\n\u201cI have not made any arrangements as of yet, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cYou will stay here,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cStapes?\u201d He called in a voice hardly louder than his normal speaking tone, and the portly, grocer-looking fellow appeared almost instantly. \u201cSet our new guest somewhere in the south wing, near the gardens.\u201d He turned back to me. \u201cWill your luggage be following?\u201d\n\u201cI fear all my luggage was lost on the way, your grace. Shipwreck.\u201d\nAlveron raised an eyebrow briefly. \u201cStapes will see you are properly outfitted.\u201d He folded Threpe\u2019s letter and made a gesture of dismissal. \u201cGood evening.\u201d\nI made a quick bow and followed Stapes from the room.\nThe rooms were the most opulent I\u2019d ever seen, let alone lived in, full of old\n \nwood and polished stone. The bed had a feather mattress a foot thick, and when I drew its curtains and lay inside, it seemed as big as my entire room back at Anker\u2019s.\nMy rooms were so pleasant it took me almost a full day to realize how much I hated them.\nAgain you have to think in terms of shoes. You don\u2019t want the biggest pair. You want a pair that fits. If your shoes are too big, your feet chafe and blister.\nIn a similar way, my rooms chafed at me. There was an immense empty wardrobe, empty chests of drawers, and bare bookshelves. My room in Anker\u2019s had been tiny, but here I felt like a dried pea rattling around inside an empty jewelry box.\nBut while the rooms were too large for my nonexistent possessions, they were too small for me. I was obliged to remain there, waiting for the Maer to summon me. Since I had no idea when this might happen, I was effectively trapped.\nIn defense of the Maer\u2019s hospitality, I should mention a few positive things. The food was excellent, if somewhat cold by the time it made its way from the kitchens. There was also a wonderful copper bathing basin. Servants brought the hot water, but it drained away through a series of pipes. I had not expected to find such conveniences so far from the civilizing influence of the University.\nI was visited by one of the Maer\u2019s tailors, an excitable little man who measured me six dozen different ways while chattering about the court gossip. The next day, a runner boy delivered two elaborate suits of clothing in colors that flattered me.\nIn a way, I was fortunate I\u2019d met with trouble at sea. The clothing Alveron\u2019s tailors supplied was much better than anything I could have afforded, even with Threpe\u2019s help. As a result, I cut quite a striking figure during my stay in Severen.\nBest of all, while checking the fit of my clothes the chatty tailor mentioned cloaks were in fashion. I took the opportunity to exaggerate somewhat about the cloak Fela had given me, bemoaning the loss of it.\nThe result was a richly colored burgundy cloak. It wouldn\u2019t keep the rain off worth a damn, but I was quite fond of it. Not only did it make me look rather dashing, but it was full of clever little pockets, of course.\nSo I was dressed, fed, and boarded in luxury. But despite this largess, by noon of the next day I was prowling my rooms like a cat in a crate. I itched to", "be outside, to have my lute out of pawn, to discover why the Maer needed the service of someone clever, well-spoken, and above all, discreet.", ""], "CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE": ["CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE\nGrace\nI PEERED AT THE MAER through a gap in the hedge. He was sitting on a stone bench under a shade tree in his gardens, looking every bit the gentleman in his loose sleeves and waistcoat. He wore the house colors of Alveron: sapphire and ivory. But while his clothes were fine, they weren\u2019t ostentatious. He wore a gold signet ring, but no other jewelry. Compared to many others in his court, the Maer was almost plainly dressed.\nAt first this seemed to imply that Alveron disdained the fashions of the court. But after a moment, I saw the truth of it. The ivory of his shirt was creamy and flawless, the sapphire of his waistcoat vibrant. I would have bet my thumbs they hadn\u2019t been worn more than a half-dozen times.\nAs a display of wealth, it was subtle and staggering. It was one thing to be able to afford fine clothes, but how much would it cost to maintain a wardrobe that never showed the slightest hint of wear? I thought of what Count Threpe had said about Alveron: Rich as the King of Vint.\nThe Maer himself looked much the same as before. Tall and thin. Greying and immaculately groomed. I took in the tired lines of his face, the slight tremble of his hands, his posture. He looks old, I thought to myself, but he\u2019s not.\nThe belling tower began to strike the hour. I stepped back from the hedge and strolled around the corner to meet the Maer.\nAlveron nodded, his cool eyes looking me over carefully. \u201cKvothe, I was rather hoping you would come.\u201d\nI gave a semi-formal bow. \u201cI was pleased to receive your invitation, your grace.\u201d\nAlveron made no gesture for me to seat myself, so I remained standing. I guessed he was testing my manners. \u201cI hope you do not mind our meeting outside. Have you seen the gardens yet?\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had the opportunity, your grace.\u201d I\u2019d been trapped in my damned rooms until he had sent for me.", "\u201cYou must allow me to show you around.\u201d He took hold of a polished walking stick that rested against the shade tree. \u201cI\u2019ve always found that taking some air is good for whatever troubles a body, though others disagree.\u201d He leaned forward as if he would stand, but a shadow of pain crossed his face and he drew a shallow, painful breath between his teeth. Sick. I realized. Not old, sick.\nI was at his side in a twinkling and offered him my arm. \u201cAllow me, your grace.\u201d\nThe Maer gave a stiff smile. \u201cIf I were younger, I\u2019d make light of your offer,\u201d he sighed. \u201cBut pride is the luxury of the strong.\u201d He laid a thin hand on my arm and used my support to gain his feet. \u201cI must settle for being gracious instead.\u201d\n\u201cGraciousness is the luxury of the wise,\u201d I said easily. \u201cSo it can be noted that your wisdom lends you grace.\u201d\nAlveron gave a wry chuckle and patted my arm. \u201cThat makes it a bit easier to bear, I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cWould you like your stick, your grace?\u201d I asked. \u201cOr shall we walk together?\u201d\nHe made the same dry chuckle. \u201c \u2018Walk together.\u2019 That\u2019s delicately put.\u201d He took the stick in his right hand while his left held my arm in a surprisingly strong grip.\n\u201cLord and lady,\u201d he swore under his breath. \u201cI hate to be seen doddering about. But it\u2019s less galling to lean on a young man\u2019s arm than hobble around on my own. It\u2019s a horrible thing to have your body fail you. You never think about it when you\u2019re young.\u201d\nWe began to walk, and our conversation lulled as we listened to the sound of water splashing in the fountains and birds singing in the hedges. Occasionally the Maer would point out a particular piece of statuary and tell which of his ancestors had commissioned it, made it, or (he spoke of these in a quieter, apologetic tone) plundered it from foreign lands in times of war.\nWe walked about the gardens for the better part of an hour. Alveron\u2019s weight on my arm gradually lessened and soon he was using me more for balance than support. We passed several gentlefolk who bowed or nodded to the Maer. After they were out of earshot he would mention who they were, how they ranked in court, and a snippet or two of amusing gossip.\n\u201cThey\u2019re wondering who you are,\u201d he said after one such couple had passed behind a hedge. \u201cBy tonight it will be all the talk. Are you an", "ambassador from Renere? A young noble looking for a rich fief and a wife to go along? Perhaps you are my long-lost son, a remnant from my wilder youth.\u201d He chuckled to himself and patted my arm. He might have continued, but he stumbled on a protruding flagstone and almost fell. I steadied him quickly, and eased him onto a stone bench beside the path.\n\u201cDamn and bother,\u201d he cursed, obviously embarrassed. \u201cHow would that have looked, the Maer scrabbling about like a beetle on its back?\u201d He looked around crossly, but we seemed to be alone. \u201cWould you do an old man a favor?\u201d\n\u201cI am at your disposal, your grace.\u201d\nAlveron gave me a shrewd look. \u201cAre you indeed? Well, it\u2019s a little thing. Keep secretive about who you are and what your business is. It\u2019ll do wonders for your reputation. The less you tell them, the more everyone will be wanting to get from you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep close about myself, your grace. But I would have better luck avoiding the subject of why I\u2019m here if I knew what it was. . . .\u201d\nAlveron\u2019s expression went sly. \u201cTrue. But this is too public a place. You\u2019ve shown good patience so far. Exercise it a while longer.\u201d He looked up at me. \u201cWould you be so kind as to walk me to my rooms?\u201d\nI held out my arm. \u201cCertainly, your grace.\u201d\nAfter returning to my rooms, I removed my embroidered jacket and hung it in the carved rosewood wardrobe. The huge piece of furniture was lined with cedar and sandalwood, scenting the air. Large, flawless mirrors hung on the insides of the doors.\nI walked across the polished marble floor and sat on a red velvet lounging couch. I idly wondered how exactly one was supposed to lounge. I couldn\u2019t remember ever doing it myself. After a moment\u2019s consideration, I decided lounging was probably similar to relaxing, but with more money in your pocket.\nRestless, I got to my feet and moved around the room. There were paintings on the walls, portraits and pastoral scenes done skillfully in oil. One wall held a huge tapestry that showed a vast naval battle in intricate detail. That occupied my attention for almost half an hour.\n \nI missed my lute.\nIt had been terribly hard to pawn it, like cutting off my hand. I\u2019d fully expected to spend the next ten days sick with worry, anxious that I wouldn\u2019t be able to buy it back.\nBut without meaning to, the Maer himself had set my mind at ease. In my wardrobe hung six suits of clothing, fine enough for any lord. When they had been delivered to my room, I\u2019d felt myself relax. My first thought on seeing them wasn\u2019t that I could now mingle comfortably with court society. I thought that if worse came to worst, I could steal them, sell them to a fripperer, and easily have enough money to reclaim my lute.\nOf course if I did such a thing, I would burn all my bridges with the Maer. It would render my entire trip to Severen pointless, and would embarrass Threpe so profoundly that he might never speak to me again. Nevertheless, knowing I had that option gave me a thin thread of control over the situation. It was enough so I could keep from going absolutely mad with worry.\nI missed my lute, but if I could gain the Maer\u2019s patronage, my life\u2019s road would grow suddenly smooth and straight. The Maer had money enough for me to continue my education at the University. His connections could help me continue my research into the Amyr.\nPerhaps most important was the power of his name. If the Maer were my patron, I would be under his protection. Ambrose\u2019s father might be the most powerful baron in all of Vintas, a dozen steps from royalty. But Alveron was practically a king in his own right. How much simpler would my life become without Ambrose endlessly spiking my wheel? It was a giddy thought.\nI missed my lute, but all things have their price. For a chance of having the Maer as a patron, I was willing to grit my teeth and spend a span bored and anxious, without music.\nAlveron turned out to be right about the curious nature of his attendant court. After he called me to his study that evening, rumor exploded like a brushfire around me. I could understand why the Maer enjoyed this sort of thing. It was like watching stories being born.", ""], "CHAPTER FIFTY-SIX": ["CHAPTER FIFTY-SIX\nPower\nALVERON SENT FOR ME again the next day, and soon the two of us were strolling along the garden paths again, his hand resting lightly on my arm. \u201cLet\u2019s head toward the south side.\u201d The Maer pointed with his walking stick. \u201cI hear the selas will reach full bloom soon.\u201d\nWe took the left turning of the path and he drew a breath. \u201cThere are two types of power: inherent and granted,\u201d Alveron said, letting me know the topic of today\u2019s conversation. \u201cInherent power you possess as a part of yourself. Granted power is lent or given by other people.\u201d He looked sideways at me. I nodded.\nSeeing my agreement, the Maer continued. \u201cInherent power is an obvious thing. Strength of body.\u201d He patted my supporting arm. \u201cStrength of mind. Strength of personality. All these things lie within a person. They define us. They determine our limits.\u201d\n\u201cNot entirely, your grace,\u201d I protested gently. \u201cA man can always improve himself.\u201d\n\u201cThey limit us,\u201d the Maer said firmly. \u201cA man with one hand will never wrestle in the roundings. A man with one leg will never run as quickly as a man with two.\u201d\n\u201cAn Adem warrior with only one hand might be more deadly than a common warrior with two, your grace.\u201d I pointed out. \u201cDespite his deficiency.\u201d\n\u201cTrue, true,\u201d the Maer said crossly. \u201cWe can improve ourselves, exercise our bodies, educate our minds, groom ourselves carefully.\u201d He ran a hand down his immaculate salt-and-pepper beard. \u201cFor even appearance is a type of power. But there are always limits. While a one-handed man might become a passable warrior, he could not play a lute.\u201d\nI nodded slowly. \u201cYou make a good point, your grace. Our power has limits we can extend, but not indefinitely.\u201d\nAlveron held up a finger. \u201cBut that is only the first type of power. We are", "only limited if we rely upon the power we ourselves possess. There is still the type of power that is given. Do you understand what I mean by granted power?\u201d\nI thought a moment. \u201cTaxes?\u201d\n\u201cHmm,\u201d the Maer said, surprised. \u201cThat\u2019s a rather good example, actually. Have you put much thought into this sort of thing before?\u201d\n\u201cA bit,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut never in these terms.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a difficult thing,\u201d he said, sounding pleased by my response. \u201cWhich do you think is the greater type of power?\u201d\nI only had to think for a second. \u201cThe inherent, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cInteresting. Why do you say that?\u201d\n\u201cBecause a power you possess yourself cannot be taken away, your grace.\u201d \u201cAh.\u201d He raised a long finger as if to caution me. \u201cBut we\u2019ve already\nagreed that type of power is severely limited. Granted power has no limits.\u201d \u201cNo limits, your grace?\u201d\nAlveron nodded his head in concession. \u201cVery few limits, then.\u201d\nI still didn\u2019t agree. The Maer must have seen it on my face because he\nleaned toward me to explain. \u201cLet\u2019s say I have an enemy, young and strong. Let\u2019s say he has stolen something of mine, some money. Are you with me?\u201d\nI nodded.\n\u201cNo manner of training will make me the match of a quarrelsome twenty- year-old. So what do I do? I get one of my young, strong friends to go and box his ears. With that strength I can accomplish a feat which would be otherwise impossible.\u201d\n\u201cYour enemy could box your friend\u2019s ears instead,\u201d I pointed out as we rounded a corner. An arching trellis turned the path ahead of us into a shaded tunnel, thick with deep green leaves.\n\u201cLet\u2019s say I got three friends together,\u201d the Maer amended. \u201cSuddenly I\u2019ve been granted the strength of three men! My enemy, even if he were very strong, could never be as strong as that. Look to the selas. Terribly difficult to cultivate, they tell me.\u201d\nWe entered the shadow of the trellis tunnel where hundreds of deep red petals blossomed in the shade of leaf and arch. The smell was sweet and tremulous. I brushed a hand across one of the deep red blooms. It was unspeakably soft. I thought of Denna.\nThe Maer returned to our discussion. \u201cYou\u2019re missing the point, anyway. The lending of strength is just a small example. Some types of power can", "only be given.\u201d\nHe made a subtle gesture to a corner of the garden. \u201cDo you see Compte\nFarlend over there? If you asked him about his title, he would say he possesses it. He would claim it is a part of him as much as his own blood. A part of his blood, in fact. Almost any noble would say the same thing. They would argue their lineage imbued them with the right to rule.\u201d\nThe Maer looked up at me, his eyes glittering in amusement. \u201cBut they\u2019re wrong. It is not inherent power. It is granted. I could take away his lands and leave him a pauper on the street.\u201d\nAlveron motioned me closer, and I leaned a bit. \u201cHere is a great secret. Even my title, my riches, my control over people and the land. It is only granted power. It belongs to me no more than does the strength of your arm.\u201d He patted my hand and smiled at me. \u201cBut I know the difference, and that is why I am always in control.\u201d\nHe straightened and spoke in normal tones. \u201cGood afternoon, Compte. Lovely day to be out in the sun, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d\n\u201cIndeed, your grace. The selas are quite breathtaking.\u201d The Compte was a heavy man with jowls and a thick mustache. \u201cMy compliments.\u201d\nAfter the compte had passed us by, Alveron continued. \u201cYou notice he complimented me on the selas? I have never touched a trowel in my life.\u201d He looked sideways at me, his expression slightly smug. \u201cDo you still think inherent power is the better of the two?\u201d\n\u201cYou make a compelling point, your grace,\u201d I said. \u201cHowever\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a hard one to convince. One last example, then. Can we agree that I will never be able to give birth to a child?\u201d\n\u201cI think that is safe to say, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cYet if a woman grants me the right to wed her, I can give birth to a son. Through granted power, a man can make himself as fast as a horse, as strong as an ox. Can inherent power do this for you?\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t argue that. \u201cI bow to your argument, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cI bow to your wisdom in accepting it.\u201d He chuckled, and at the same time the faint ringing of the hour moved through the garden. \u201cOh bother,\u201d the Maer said, his expression souring. \u201cI must go take that dreadful nostrum of mine or Caudicus will be completely unmanageable for a span of days.\u201d I gave him a quizzical look and he explained. \u201cHe somehow discovered that I poured yesterday\u2019s dose in the chamber pot.\u201d\n\u201cYour grace should be mindful of your health.\u201d", "Alveron scowled. \u201cYou overstep yourself,\u201d he snapped.\nI flushed in embarrassment, but before I could apologize he waved me into silence. \u201cYou\u2019re right, of course. I know my duty. But you sound just like him. One Caudicus is enough for me.\u201d\nHe paused to nod toward an approaching couple. The man was tall and handsome, a few years older than myself. The woman was perhaps thirty, with dark eyes and an elegant, wicked mouth. \u201cGood evening, Lady Hesua. I trust your father is continuing to improve?\u201d\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d she said. \u201cThe surgeon says he should be up before the span is through.\u201d She caught my eye and held it briefly, her red mouth curving into a knowing smile.\nThen she was past us. I found myself sweating a bit.\nIf the Maer noticed, he ignored it. \u201cTerrible woman. New man every span of days. Her father was wounded in a duel with Esquire Higton over an \u2018inappropriate\u2019 remark. A true remark, but that doesn\u2019t count for much once the swords are out.\u201d\n\u201cWhat of the squire?\u201d\n\u201cDied the day after. Pity too. He was a good man, just didn\u2019t know enough to mind his tongue.\u201d He sighed and looked up at the belling tower. \u201cAs I was saying. One physician is quite enough for me. Caudicus clucks over me like a mother hen. I hate taking medicine when I am already on the mend.\u201d\nThe Maer did seem better today. He hadn\u2019t really needed the support of my arm during our walk. I sensed he only leaned on me to give us an excuse to be talking so close together. \u201cYour improving health seems proof enough that his ministrations work to heal you,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYes, yes. His potives drive away my illness for a span of days. Sometimes for months.\u201d He sighed bitterly. \u201cBut they always come back. Shall I be drinking potions the rest of my life?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps the need for them will pass, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cI had hoped the same thing myself. In his recent travels Caudicus gathered some herbs that worked wondrous well. His last treatment left me hale for nearly a year. I thought I was finally free of it.\u201d The Maer scowled down at his walking stick. \u201cYet here I am.\u201d\n\u201cIf I could aid you in any way, your grace, I would.\u201d\nAlveron turned his head to look me in the eye. After a moment he nodded to himself. \u201cI do believe you would,\u201d he said. \u201cHow extraordinary.\u201d", " Several conversations of a similar sort followed. I could tell the Maer was trying to get a feel for me. With all the skill learned in forty years of courtly intrigue, he steered the conversation in subtle ways, learning my opinions, determining whether or not I was worthy of his trust.\nWhile I didn\u2019t have the Maer\u2019s experience, I was a fair conversationalist myself. I was always careful with my answers, always courteous. After a few days, a mutual respect began to grow between us. Not a friendship such as I had with Count Threpe. The Maer never encouraged me to disregard his title or sit in his presence, but we were growing closer. While Threpe was a friend, the Maer was like a distant grandfather: kind but older, serious, and reserved.\nI got the impression the Maer was a lonely man, forced to remain aloof from his subjects and the members of his court. I almost suspected he might have sent to Threpe for a companion. Someone clever but removed from the politics of court so he could have an honest conversation once in a while.\nAt first I dismissed such an idea as unlikely, but the days continued to pass and still the Maer avoided any mention of what use he planned to put me to.\nIf I\u2019d had my lute I could have passed the time pleasantly, but it still lay in Severen-Low, seven days away from belonging to the pawnshop. So there was no music, just my echoing rooms and my damnable useless idleness.\nAs rumors about me spread, various members of the court came to visit. Some made a pretense of welcoming me. Others made a show of wanting to gossip. I even suspected there were a few attempts at seduction, but at that point in my life I knew so little of women that I was immune to those games. One gentleman even tried to borrow money from me, and I was hard pressed not to laugh in his face.\nThey told different stories and used different degrees of subtlety, but they were all there for the same reason: to glean information from me. However, since I was under the Maer\u2019s instructions to be tight-lipped about myself, all the conversations were brief and unsatisfying.\nAll but one, I should say. The exception proves the rule.", ""], "CHAPTER FIFTY-SEVEN": ["CHAPTER FIFTY-SEVEN\nA Handful of Iron\nI MET BREDON ON MY fourth day in Severen. It was early, but I was already pacing my rooms, nearly insane with boredom. I\u2019d had my breakfast, and it was hours before lunch.\nSo far today I\u2019d dealt with three courtiers come to pry at me. I dealt with them deftly, running our conversations aground at every opportunity. So where are you from, my boy? Oh, you know how it is. One travels so. And your parents? Yes actually. I had them. Two in fact. What brings you to Severen? A coach and four, for the most part. Though I walked a bit as well. Good for the lungs, you know. And what are you doing here? Enjoying good conversation, of course. Meeting interesting people. Really? Who? Why all sorts. Including you, Lord Praevek. You are quite the fascinating fellow . . . .\nAnd so on. It wasn\u2019t long before even the most tenacious rumormonger grew weary and left.\nWorst of all, these brief exchanges would be the most interesting part of my day if the Maer didn\u2019t call for me. So far we\u2019d conversed over a light lunch, three times during brief walks in the garden, and once late at night when most sensible people would be abed. Twice Alveron\u2019s runner woke me from a sound sleep before the sky began to color with the blue beginning of dawn\u2019s light.\nI know when I am being tested. Alveron wanted to see if I was truly willing to make myself available to him at any unreasonable hour of the day or night. He was watching to see if I would become impatient or irritated by his casual use of me.\nSo I played the game. I was charming and unfailingly polite. I came when he called and left as soon as he was through with me. I asked no impertinent questions, made no demands on him, and spent the remainder of my day grinding my teeth, pacing my overlarge rooms, and trying not to think about how many days I had left before the span note on my lute expired.\nSmall wonder that a knock on that fourth day sent me scrambling for the", "door. I hoped it was a summons from the Maer, but at this point, any distraction would be welcome.\nI opened the door to reveal an older man, a gentleman down to his bones. His clothes gave him away, certainly, but more important was the fact that he wore his wealth with the comfortable indifference of someone born into it. New-made nobles, pretenders, and rich merchants simply don\u2019t carry themselves the same way.\nAlveron\u2019s manservant, for example, had finer clothes than half the gentry, but despite the self-assurance Stapes possessed, he looked like a baker wearing his holiday best.\nThanks to Alveron\u2019s tailors, I was dressed as well as anyone. The colors were good on me, leaf green, black, and burgundy, with silver workings on the cuff and collar. However, unlike Stapes, I wore the clothes with the casual ease of nobility. True, the brocade itched. True, the buttons, buckles, and endless layers made every outfit stiff and awkward as a suit of mercenary\u2019s leathers. But I lounged in it as easily as if it were a second skin. It was a costume, you see, and I played my part as only a trouper can.\nAs I was saying, I opened the door to see an older gentleman standing in the hall.\n\u201cSo you\u2019re Kvothe, are you?\u201d he asked.\nI nodded, caught slightly off my stride. The custom in northern Vintas was to send a servant ahead to request a meeting. The runner brought a note and a ring with the noble\u2019s name inscribed.You sent a gold ring to request a meeting with a noble of higher rank than yourself, silver for someone of roughly the same rank, and iron for someone beneath you.\nI didn\u2019t have any rank, of course. No title, no lands, no family, and no blood. I was lowborn as they come, but no one here knew that. Everyone assumed the mysterious red-haired man spending time with Alveron was some flavor of nobility, and my origin and standing was a much-debated topic.\nThe important thing was that I had not been officially introduced to the court. As such, I had no official ranking. That meant all the rings sent to me were iron. And one does not typically refuse a request sent with an iron ring, lest one offend one\u2019s betters.\nSo it was rather surprising to find this older gentleman standing outside the door. Obviously noble, but unannounced and uninvited.\n\u201cYou may call me Bredon,\u201d he said, looking me in the eye. \u201cDo you know", "how to play tak?\u201d\nI shook my head, unsure what to make of this.\nHe gave a small, disappointed sigh. \u201cAh well, I can teach you.\u201d He thrust a\nblack velvet sack toward me and I took hold of it with both hands. It felt as if it were full of small, smooth stones.\nBredon gestured behind him, and a pair of young men bustled into my room carrying a small table. I stepped out of their way, and Bredon swept through the door in their wake. \u201cSet it by the window,\u201d he directed them, pointing with his walking stick. \u201cAnd bring some chairs\u2014No, the rail-back chairs.\u201d\nIn a short moment everything was arranged to his satisfaction. The two servants left, and Bredon turned to me with an apologetic look on his face. \u201cYou\u2019ll forgive an old man a dramatic entrance, I hope?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said graciously. \u201cPlease have a seat.\u201d I gestured toward the new table by the window.\n\u201cSuch aplomb,\u201d he chuckled, leaning his walking stick against the window sill. The sunlight caught on the polished silver handle wrought in the shape of a snarling wolf \u2019s head.\nBredon was older. Not elderly by any means, but what I consider grandfather old. His colors weren\u2019t colors at all, merely ash grey and a dark charcoal. His hair and beard were pure white, and all cut to the same length, making a frame for his face. As he sat there, peering at me with his lively brown eyes, he reminded me of an owl.\nI took a seat across from him and wondered idly how he was going to attempt to wheedle information out of me. He\u2019d obviously brought a game. Perhaps he\u2019d try to gamble it out of me. That would be a new approach at least.\nHe smiled at me. An honest smile I found myself returning before I realized what I was doing. \u201cYou must have a fair collection of rings by this point,\u201d he said.\nI nodded.\nHe leaned forward curiously. \u201cWould you mind terribly if I looked them over?\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d I went into the other room and brought back a handful of rings, spilling them onto the table.\nHe looked them over, nodding to himself. \u201cYou\u2019ve had all our best gossipmongers descend on you. Veston, Praevek, and Temenlovy have all", "taken a crack.\u201d His eyebrows went up as he saw the name on another ring. \u201cPraevek twice. And none of them got a shred of anything out of you. Nothing half as solid as a whisper.\u201d\nBredon glanced up at me. \u201cThat tells me you are keeping your tongue tightly between your teeth, and you are good at it. Rest assured, I\u2019m not here in some vain attempt to pry at your secrets.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t entirely believe him, but it was nice to hear. \u201cI\u2019ll admit that\u2019s a relief.\u201d\n\u201cAs a brief aside,\u201d he mentioned casually. \u201cI\u2019ll mention the rings are traditionally left in the sitting room near the door. They are displayed as a mark of status.\u201d\nI hadn\u2019t known that, but I didn\u2019t want to admit to it. If I was unfamiliar with the customs of the local court, it would let him know I was either a foreigner or not one of the gentry. \u201cThere\u2019s no real status in a handful of iron,\u201d I said dismissively. Count Threpe had explained the basics of the rings to me before I left Imre. But he wasn\u2019t from Vintas, and obviously hadn\u2019t known the fine points.\n\u201cThere\u2019s some truth to that,\u201d Bredon said easily. \u201cBut not the truth entire. Gold rings imply those below you are working to curry your favor. Silver indicates a healthy working relationship with your peers.\u201d He laid the rings in a row on the table. \u201cHowever, iron means you have the attention of your betters. It indicates you are desirable.\u201d\nI nodded slowly. \u201cOf course,\u201d I said. \u201cAny ring the Maer sends will be an iron one.\u201d\n\u201cExactly.\u201d Bredon nodded. \u201cTo have a ring from the Maer is a mark of great favor.\u201d He pushed the rings toward me across the top of the smooth marble table. \u201cBut there is no such ring here, and that itself is meaningful.\u201d\n\u201cIt seems you\u2019re no stranger to courtly politics yourself,\u201d I pointed out.\nBredon closed his eyes and nodded a weary agreement. \u201cI was quite fond of it when I was young. I was even something of a power, as these things go. But at present, I have no machinations to advance. That takes the spice from such maneuverings.\u201d He looked at me again, meeting my eyes directly.\u201cI have simpler tastes now. I travel. I enjoy wines and conversation with interesting people. I\u2019ve even been learning how to dance.\u201d\nHe smiled again, warmly, and rapped a knuckle on the board. \u201cMore than anything, however, I enjoy playing tak. However, I know few people with time or wit enough to play the game properly.\u201d He raised an eyebrow at me.", "I hesitated. \u201cOne might assume that someone well-skilled in the subtle art of conversation could use long stretches of idle chatter to glean information from an unsuspecting victim.\u201d\nBredon smiled. \u201cBy the names on these rings, I can tell you\u2019ve seen nothing but the most gaudy and grasping of us. You\u2019re understandably skittish regarding your secrets, whatever they may be.\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cConsider this instead. Those who have approached you are like magpies. They caw and flap around you, hoping to snatch something bright to carry home with them.\u201d He rolled his eyes disdainfully. \u201cWhat gain is there in that? Some small notoriety, I suppose. Some brief elevation among one\u2019s gaudy, gossipy peers.\u201d\nBredon ran a hand over his white beard. \u201cI am no magpie. I need nothing shiny, nor do I care what gossipmongers think. I play a longer, more subtle game.\u201d He began to work the drawstring loose on the black velvet bag. \u201cYou are a man of some wit. I know this as the Maer does not waste his time with fools. I know you either stand in the Maer\u2019s good grace, or you have a chance to gain that grace. So here is my plan.\u201d He smiled his warm smile again. \u201cWould you like to hear my plan?\u201d\nI found myself smiling back without meaning to, as I had before. \u201cThat would be unusually kind of you.\u201d\n\u201cMy plan is to insinuate myself into your favor now. I will make myself useful and entertaining. I will provide conversation and a way to pass the time.\u201d He spilled a set of round stones out onto the marble tabletop. \u201cThen, when your star grows ascendant in the Maer\u2019s sky, I may find myself in possession of an unexpectedly useful friend.\u201d He began to sort the stones into their different colors. \u201cAnd should your star fail to rise, I am still richer by several games of tak.\u201d\n\u201cI also imagine it won\u2019t hurt your reputation to spend several hours alone with me,\u201d I mentioned. \u201cGiven that all my other conversations have been barren things not likely to last a quarter hour.\u201d\n\u201cThere is some truth to that as well,\u201d he said as he began to arrange the stones. His curious brown eyes smiled at me again. \u201cOh yes, I think I\u2019m going to have quite a bit of fun playing with you.\u201d\n \nMy next several hours were spent learning how to play tak. Even if I had not been nearly mad with idleness, I would have enjoyed it. Tak is the best sort of game: simple in its rules, complex in its strategy. Bredon beat me handily in all five games we played, but I am proud to say that he never beat me the same way twice.\nAfter the fifth game he leaned back with a satisfied sigh. \u201cThat was approaching a good game. You got clever in the corner here.\u201d He wiggled his fingers at the edge of the board.\n\u201cNot clever enough.\u201d\n\u201cClever nonetheless. What you attempted is called a brooker\u2019s fall, just so you know.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s the name for the way you got away from it?\u201d\n\u201cI call it Bredon\u2019s defense,\u201d he said, smiling rakishly. \u201cBut that\u2019s what I call any maneuver when I get out of a tight corner by being uncommonly clever.\u201d\nI laughed and began to separate the stones again. \u201cAnother?\u201d\nBredon sighed. \u201cAlas, I have an unavoidable appointment. I needn\u2019t hurry out the door, but I don\u2019t have enough time for another game. Not a proper one.\u201d\nHis brown eyes looked me over as he began to gather the stones into the velvet bag. \u201cI won\u2019t insult you by asking if you\u2019re familiar with the local customs,\u201d Bredon said. \u201cHowever, I thought I might give a few general pieces of advice, on the off chance they might be helpful.\u201d He smiled at me. \u201cIt would be best to listen, of course. If you refuse, you reveal your knowledge of these things.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said with a straight face.\nBredon slid open the table\u2019s drawer and pulled out the handful of iron rings we had swept aside to clear the board for our game. \u201cThe presentation of the rings implies a great deal. If they are jumbled in a bowl for example, it implies disinterest in the social aspects of the court.\u201d\nHe arranged the rings with their engraved names facing me. \u201cLaid out in careful display, they show you are proud of your connections.\u201d He looked up and smiled. \u201cEither way, a new arrival is usually left alone in the sitting room on some pretext. This gives them a chance to paw through your collection in order to satisfy their curiosity.\u201d\nShrugging, Bredon pushed the rings toward me. \u201cYou have, of course, always made a point of offering to return the rings to their owners.\u201d He was", "careful not to make it into a question.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said honestly. Threpe had known that much.\n\u201cIt is the most polite thing to do.\u201d He looked up at me, his brown eyes\npeering owlishly from the halo of his white hair and beard. \u201cHave you worn any of them in public?\u201d\nI held up my bare hands.\n\u201cWearing a ring can indicate a debt, or that you are attempting to curry favor.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cIf the Maer ever declines to take his ring back from you, it would be an indication he was willing to make your connection somewhat more formal.\u201d\n\u201cAnd not wearing the ring would be viewed as a slight,\u201d I said.\nBredon smiled. \u201cPerhaps. It is one thing to display a ring in your sitting room, quite another to display it on your hand. Wearing the ring of one\u2019s better can be viewed as quite presumptuous. Also, if you wore another noble\u2019s ring while visiting the Maer, he might take it amiss. As if someone had poached you from his forest.\u201d\nHe leaned back in his chair. \u201cI mention these things as general talking points,\u201d he said, \u201csuspecting this information is already well known to you, and you are politely letting an old man ramble.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps I am still reeling from a series of numbing defeats at tak,\u201d I said.\nHe waved my comment away, and I noticed he wore no rings of any sort on his fingers. \u201cYou took to it quickly, like a baron at a brothel, as they say. I expect you\u2019ll prove a decent challenge after a month or so.\u201d\n\u201cWait and see,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll beat you the next time we play.\u201d\nBredon chuckled. \u201cI like to hear that.\u201d He reached into his pocket and pulled out a smaller velvet bag. \u201cI have also brought you a small gift.\u201d\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly,\u201d I said reflexively. \u201cYou\u2019ve already provided me with an afternoon\u2019s entertainment.\u201d\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he said, pushing the bag across the table. \u201cI must insist. These are yours without obligation, let, or lien. A freely given gift.\u201d\nI upended the bag and three rings chimed into my palm. Gold, silver, and iron. Each of them had my name etched into the metal: Kvothe.\n\u201cI heard a rumor your luggage was lost,\u201d Bredon said. \u201cAnd thought these might prove useful.\u201d He smiled. \u201cEspecially if you desire another game of tak.\u201d\nI rolled the rings around in my hand, idly wondering if the gold ring was solid or simply plated. \u201cAnd what ring would I send my new acquaintance if I", "desired his company?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Bredon said slowly. \u201cThat is complicated. By my rash and\nunseemly barging into your rooms, I have neglected a proper introduction and failed to inform you as to my title and rank.\u201d His brown eyes looked into mine seriously.\n\u201cAnd it would be terribly rude of me to inquire about such things,\u201d I said slowly, not quite sure what he was playing at.\nHe nodded. \u201cSo for now, you must assume I am without either title or rank. That puts us on a curious footing: you unannounced to the court, and myself unannounced to you. As such, it would be fitting for you to send me a silver ring if, in the future, you would like to share a lunch or graciously lose another game of tak.\u201d\nI rolled the silver ring around in my fingers. If I sent it to him, rumor would get around that I was claiming a rank roughly equal to his, and I had no idea what rank that was. \u201cWhat will people say?\u201d\nHis eyes danced a bit. \u201cWhat indeed?\u201d\nSo the days continued to pass. The Maer summoned me for urbane chatter. Magpie nobles sent their cards and rings and were met with polite conversational rebuffment.\nBredon alone kept me from growing mad with caged boredom. The next day I sent him my new silver ring with a card saying, \u201cAt your leisure. My rooms.\u201d Five minutes later he arrived with his tak table and bag of stones. He offered my ring back to me and I accepted it as graciously as possible. I wouldn\u2019t have minded him keeping it. But as he knew, I only had the one.\nOur fifth game was interrupted when I was summoned by the Maer, his ring of iron sitting darkly on the runner\u2019s polished silver tray. I made my apologies to Bredon and hurried off to the gardens.\nLater that night Bredon sent me his own silver ring and a card saying, \u201cAfter supper.Your rooms.\u201d I wrote \u201cDelighted\u201d on the card and sent it back.\nWhen he arrived, I offered to return his ring. He politely declined and it joined the rest in the bowl by my door. It sat there for everyone to see, bright silver glittering among the handful of iron.\n \n"], "CHAPTER FIFTY-EIGHT": ["CHAPTER FIFTY-EIGHT\nCourting\nTHE MAER HAD NOT called on me for two days.\nI was trapped in my rooms, and near mad with boredom and irritation.\nWorst was the fact that I didn\u2019t know why the Maer wasn\u2019t calling on me. Was he busy? Had I offended him? I thought of sending him a card along with the gold ring Bredon had given me. But if Alveron were testing my patience, that could be a grave mistake.\nBut I was impatient. I had come here to gain a patron, or at least some assistance in my pursuit of the Amyr. So far, all I had to show for my time in the Maer\u2019s service was a profoundly flattened ass. If it hadn\u2019t been for Bredon, I swear I would have gone frothing mad.\nWorse, my lute and Denna\u2019s lovely case were only two days away from becoming someone else\u2019s property. I had hoped by this point to have gained enough of the Maer\u2019s favor that I could ask him for the money I needed to get it out of pawn. I\u2019d wanted him to be indebted to me, not the other way around. Once you owe something to a member of the nobility, it is notoriously difficult to work your way free of their debt.\nBut if Alveron\u2019s lack of summons was any indication, I seemed to be far from his good graces. I racked my memory, trying to think of what I might have said during our last conversation that could have offended him.\nI\u2019d pulled a card from the drawer and was trying to think of a politic way of asking the Maer for money when a knock came at the door. Thinking it was my lunch come early, I called for the boy to leave it on the table.\nThere was a significant pause that roused me from my reverie. I hurried to the door and was startled to see the Maer\u2019s manservant, Stapes, standing outside. Alveron\u2019s summons had always been delivered by runner before.\n\u201cThe Maer would like to see you,\u201d he said. I noticed the manservant looked worn around the edges. His eyes were weary, as if he hadn\u2019t been sleeping enough.\n\u201cIn the garden?\u201d", "\u201cIn his rooms,\u201d Stapes said. \u201cI will take you there.\u201d\nIf the gossiping courtiers were to be believed, Alveron rarely received visitors in his rooms. As I fell into step behind Stapes, I couldn\u2019t help but feel relief. Anything was better than waiting.\nAlveron was propped upright in his great feather bed. He seemed paler and thinner than when I\u2019d seen him last. His eyes were still clear and sharp, but today they held something else, some hard emotion.\nHe gestured to a nearby chair. \u201cKvothe. Come in. Sit down.\u201d His voice was weaker too, but it still carried the weight of command. I sat at his bedside, sensing the time was not appropriate for thanking him for the privilege.\n\u201cDo you know how old I am, Kvothe?\u201d he said without preamble. \u201cNo, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cWhat would your guess be? How old do I seem?\u201d I caught the hard\nemotion in his eyes again: anger. A slow, smoldering anger, like hot coals beneath a thin layer of ash.\nMy mind raced, trying to decide what the best answer might be. I didn\u2019t want to risk giving offense, but flattery irritated the Maer unless it was done with consummate subtlety and skill.\nMy last resort then. Honesty. \u201cFifty-one, your grace. Perhaps fifty-two.\u201d\nHe nodded slowly, his anger seeming to fade like thunder in the distance. \u201cNever ask a young man your age. I am forty, with a birthday next span. You\u2019re right though, I look fifty years if I look a day. Some might even say you were being generous.\u201d His hands smoothed the bedcovers absently. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible thing, growing old before your time.\u201d\nHe stiffened in pain, grimacing. After a moment it passed, and he drew a deep breath. A faint sheen of sweat covered his face. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll be able to speak with you. I don\u2019t seem to be doing very well today.\u201d\nI stood. \u201cShould I fetch Caudicus, your grace?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he spat. \u201cSit down.\u201d\nI did.\n\u201cThis damnable sickness has crept on me this last month, adding years and\nmaking me feel them. I have spent my life tending to my lands, but I have been lax in one regard. I have no family, no heir.\u201d\n \n\u201cDo you mean to take a wife, your grace?\u201d\nHe sagged against his pillows. \u201cThe rumor has finally gotten around, has it?\u201d\n\u201cNo, your grace. I guessed it from what you\u2019ve said in some of our conversations.\u201d\nHe gave me a penetrating look. \u201cTruthfully? A guess and not from a rumor?\u201d\n\u201cTruthfully, your grace. There are rumors, a whole courtload, if you\u2019ll excuse the expression.\u201d\n\u201c \u2018Courtload.\u2019 That\u2019s good.\u201d He smiled a thin whisper of a smile.\n\u201cBut most of it concerns some mysterious visitor from the west.\u201d I performed a small seated bow. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing of marriage. Everyone sees you as the world\u2019s first bachelor.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d he said, his face showing his relief. \u201cThat used to be the case. My father tried to marry me off when I was younger. I was rather strong-headed about not taking a wife at the time. That\u2019s another problem with power. If you possess too much, people don\u2019t dare point out your mistakes. Power can be a terrible thing.\u201d\n\u201cI imagine so, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cIt takes away your choices,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gives a man opportunities, but at the same time it takes others away. My situation is difficult, to say the least.\u201d\nOver the course of my life I\u2019ve been hungry too many times to feel much empathy for the nobility. But the Maer looked so pale and weak as he lay there that I felt a flicker of sympathy. \u201cWhat situation is that, your grace?\u201d\nAlveron struggled to sit upright against his pillows. \u201cIf I am to be married, it must be to someone suitable. Someone from a family well-positioned as my own. Not only that, but this cannot be a marriage of alliance. The girl must be young enough to\u2014\u201d He cleared his throat, a papery noise. \u201cProduce an heir. Several if possible.\u201d He looked up at me. \u201cDo you begin to see my problem?\u201d\nI nodded slowly. \u201cJust the bare shape of it, your grace. How many such daughters are there?\u201d\n\u201cA bare handful,\u201d Alveron said, a hint of the old fire coming back to his voice. \u201cBut it can\u2019t be one of the young women the king has under his control. Bargaining chips and treaty sealers. My family has fought to hold our plenary powers since the founding of Vintas. I won\u2019t negotiate with that bastard Roderic for a wife. I won\u2019t remit a grain of power to him.\u201d\n\u201cHow many women are beyond the king\u2019s control, your grace?\u201d", "\u201cOne.\u201d The word fell like a lead weight. \u201cAnd that is not the worst of it. The woman is perfect in every way. Her family is respectable. She is educated. Young. Beautiful.\u201d The last word seemed to come hard to him.\n\u201cShe is pursued by a flock of love-struck courtiers, strong young men with honey on their tongues. They want her for every reason, her name, her land, her wit.\u201d He gave a long pause. \u201cHow will she respond to the courting of a sick old man who walks with a stick when he can walk at all?\u201d His mouth twisted, as if the words were bitter.\n\u201cBut surely your position . . .\u201d I began.\nHe lifted a hand and looked me squarely in the eye. \u201cWould you marry a woman you had bought?\u201d\nI looked down. \u201cNo, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cNeither will I. The thought of using my position to persuade this girl to marry me is . . . distasteful.\u201d\nWe were quiet for a moment. Outside the window I watched two squirrels chase each other around the tall trunk of an ash tree. \u201cYour grace, if I am going to help you pay court to this lady . . .\u201d I felt the heat of the Maer\u2019s anger before I turned to see it. \u201cI beg pardon, your grace. I\u2019ve overstepped myself.\u201d\n\u201cIs this another one of your guesses then?\u201d\n\u201cYes, your grace.\u201d\nHe seemed to struggle with himself for a moment. Then he sighed, and the\ntension in the room faded. \u201cI must ask your pardon. This clawing pain wears my temper thin, and it is not my custom to discuss personal matters with strangers, much less have them guessed from underneath me. Tell me the rest of what you guess. Be bold, if you must.\u201d\nI breathed a little easier. \u201cI guess you want to marry this woman. To suit your duty, primarily, but also because you love her.\u201d\nThere was another pause, not so bad as the last one, but tense nonetheless. \u201cLove,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cis a word the foolish use too often. She is worthy of love, that is certain. And I have a fondness for her.\u201d He looked uncomfortable. \u201cThat is all I will say.\u201d He turned to look at me. \u201cCan I count on your discretion?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, your grace. But why so secretive about it?\u201d\n\u201cI prefer to move at a time of my own choosing. Rumor forces us to act before we are ready, or ruins a situation before it becomes fully ripe.\u201d\n\u201cI understand. What is the lady\u2019s name?\u201d", "\u201cMeluan Lackless,\u201d he said her name carefully. \u201cNow, I have discovered for myself that you are charming and well-mannered. What\u2019s more, Count Threpe assures me you are a great maker and player of songs. These things are exactly what I need. Will you enter my service in this regard?\u201d\nI hesitated. \u201cHow exactly will your grace be putting me to use?\u201d\nHe gave me a skeptical look. \u201cI would think it rather obvious for so excellent a guesser as yourself.\u201d\n\u201cI know you hope to court the lady, your grace. But I don\u2019t know how. Do you want me to compose a letter or two? Write her songs? Will I climb balconies by moonlight to leave flowers on her windowsill? Dance with her wearing a mask, claiming your name as my own?\u201d I gave him a wan smile. \u201cI\u2019m not much of a dancer, your grace.\u201d\nAlveron gave a deep, honest laugh, but even through the joyful sound of it, I could tell the act of laughing pained him. \u201cI was thinking more of the first two,\u201d he admitted, sinking back into the pillows, his eyes heavy.\nI nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll need to know more about her, your grace. Trying to court a woman without knowing her would be worse than foolish.\u201d\nAlveron nodded tiredly. \u201cCaudicus can lay the groundwork for you. He knows a great deal about the history of the families. Family is the foundation upon which a man stands. You\u2019ll need to know where she comes from if you\u2019re to court her.\u201d He motioned me closer and held out an iron ring, his arm trembling with the effort of staying in the air. \u201cShow this to Caudicus and he will know you are on my business.\u201d\nI took it quickly. \u201cDoes he know you plan to marry?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Alveron\u2019s eyes flew open. \u201cDo not speak of this to anyone! Invent some reason for your inquiries. Fetch my medicine.\u201d\nHe lay back, closing his eyes. As I left I heard him speaking faintly: \u201cSometimes they don\u2019t give it knowingly, sometimes they don\u2019t give it willingly. Nevertheless . . . all power.\u201d\n\u201cYes, your grace,\u201d I said, but he had already fallen into a fitful sleep before I left the room.", ""], "CHAPTER FIFTY-NINE": ["CHAPTER FIFTY-NINE\nPurpose\nASILEFT THE Maer\u2019s rooms, I considered sending a runner with my card and ring ahead to Caudicus. Then I dismissed the thought. I was on an errand for the Maer. Surely that would excuse a slight breach of etiquette.\nFrom the rumor mill, I knew Alveron\u2019s arcanist had been a permanent part of the Maer\u2019s court for more than a dozen years. But other than the fact that he lived in one of the estate\u2019s southern towers, I had no idea what to expect from the man.\nI knocked on the thick-timbered door.\n\u201cHold on then,\u201d the voice came faintly. There was the sound of a bolt being drawn back, and the door opened to reveal a thin man with a long, hawkish nose and curling black hair. He wore a long, dark garment vaguely reminiscent of a master\u2019s robe. \u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cI was wondering if I might borrow a moment of your time, sir?\u201d I said, my nervousness only half-feigned.\nHe looked me over, taking in my fine clothes. \u201cI don\u2019t do love potions. You can find that sort of thing down in Severen-Low.\u201d The heavy door began to inch closed. \u201cThough you\u2019d be better off with a little dancing and some roses if you ask me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here for something else,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cTwo things actually. One for the Maer and one for myself.\u201d I lifted my hand, revealing the iron ring on my palm, Alveron\u2019s name blazed in bright gold across the face of it.\nThe door stopped closing. \u201cYou\u2019d best come in, then,\u201d Caudicus said.\nThe room looked like a small University contained in a single room. Lit with the familiar red glow of sympathy lamps, there were shelves of books, tables full of twisted glassware, and far in the back, half concealed by the curving wall of the tower, I thought I could see a small furnace or kiln.\n\u201cGood God!\u201d I exclaimed, covering my mouth with one hand. \u201cIs that a dragon?\u201d I pointed to a huge stuffed crocodile that hung from one of the ceiling beams.", "You have to understand, some arcanists are more territorial than sharks, especially those who have managed to acquire luxurious court positions such as this. I had no idea how Caudicus might react to a young arcanist-in- training arriving in his territory, so I decided it was safer to play the part of a pleasantly dim, nonthreatening lordling.\nCaudicus closed the door behind me, chuckling. \u201cNo. It\u2019s an alligator. Quite harmless I assure you.\u201d\n\u201cIt gave me a bit of a start,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat is the use of such a thing?\u201d\n\u201cHonestly?\u201d He looked up at it. \u201cI don\u2019t rightly know. It belonged to the arcanist who lived here before me. It seemed a shame to throw it away. Impressive specimen, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\nI gave it a nervous look. \u201cQuite.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is this business you mentioned?\u201d He gestured to a large, cushioned chair and settled himself into a similar chair across from me. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I only have a few minutes before I will be otherwise occupied. Until then my time is yours . . .\u201d He trailed off questioningly.\nI could see he knew quite well who I was: the mysterious young man the Maer had been meeting with. I guessed he was eager as the rest to find out why I was in Severen.\n\u201cKvothe,\u201d I said. \u201cActually, the Maer\u2019s medicine is half my business.\u201d I saw a faint, irritated line appear between his eyebrows and hurried to correct whatever he might be thinking. \u201cI was speaking with the Maer earlier.\u201d I gave the barest pause, as if I was unreasonably proud of this. \u201cAnd he asked me if I might bring him his medicine after I had finished speaking with you.\u201d\nThe line disappeared. \u201cCertainly,\u201d Caudicus said easily. \u201cIt would save me the trip to his rooms. But what is the matter you wished to speak about?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d I leaned forward excitedly. \u201cI\u2019m doing research into the histories of the noble families in Vintas. I am thinking of writing a book, you see.\u201d\n\u201cA genealogy?\u201d I saw boredom begin to fog his eyes.\n\u201cOh no. There are genealogies aplenty. I was thinking of a collection of stories related to the great families.\u201d I was rather proud of this lie. Not only did it explain my curiosity about Meluan\u2019s family, it gave a reason for why I was spending so much time with the Maer. \u201cHistory tends to be rather dry, but everyone enjoys a story.\u201d\nCaudicus nodded to himself. \u201cClever idea. That could be an interesting book.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be writing a brief historical preface for each family, as an introduction", "to the stories that follow. The Maer mentioned you were quite the authority on the old families, and said he would be pleased if I called on you.\u201d\nThe compliment had its desired effect, and Caudicus puffed himself up ever so slightly. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d consider myself an authority,\u201d he said with false modesty. \u201cBut I am a bit of a historian.\u201d He raised an eyebrow at me. \u201cYou must realize the families themselves would probably be a superior source of information.\u201d\n\u201cOne would think that,\u201d I said with a sideways look. \u201cBut families tend to be reluctant to share their most interesting stories.\u201d\nCaudicus gave a wide grin. \u201cI imagine so.\u201d The grin faded just as quickly. \u201cBut I\u2019m certain I don\u2019t know any stories of that sort regarding the Maer\u2019s family,\u201d he said seriously.\n\u201cOh no no no!\u201d I waved my hands in violent negation. \u201cThe Maer is a special case. I wouldn\u2019t dream . . .\u201d I trailed off, swallowing visibly. \u201cI was hoping you might be able to enlighten me regarding the Lackless family. I\u2019m rather in the dark about them.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d he said, surprised. \u201cThey\u2019ve fallen from what they once were, but they\u2019re a treasure trove of stories.\u201d His eyes focused far away and he tapped his lips with his fingers distractedly. \u201cHow about this, I\u2019ll brush up on their history, and you can come back tomorrow for a longer talk. It\u2019s nearly time for the Maer\u2019s medicine, and it shouldn\u2019t be delayed.\u201d\nHe got to his feet and began to roll up his sleeves. \u201cThere\u2019s one thing I can remember off the top of my head, if you don\u2019t mind my rambling while I prepare the Maer\u2019s medicine.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a potion being made,\u201d I said enthusiastically. \u201cIf you wouldn\u2019t find it too distracting . . .\u201d\n\u201cNot at all. I could prepare it in my sleep.\u201d He moved behind a worktable and lit a pair of blueflame candles. I took care to look suitably impressed even though I knew they were just for show.\nCaudicus shook a portion of dried leaf onto a small hand scale and weighed it. \u201cDo you have any trouble accepting rumor into your research?\u201d\n\u201cNot if it\u2019s interesting.\u201d\nHe was silent while he carefully measured a small amount of clear liquid from a glass-stoppered bottle. \u201cFrom what I understand, the Lackless family has an heirloom. Well, not an heirloom exactly, but an ancient thing that dates back to the beginning of their line.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much odd with that. Old families are rife with heirlooms.\u201d", "\u201cHush,\u201d he said testily. \u201cThere\u2019s more to it than that.\u201d He poured the liquid into a flat lead bowl with some crude symbols carved along the outside. It bubbled and hissed, filling the air with a faint, acrid smell.\nHe decanted the liquid into the pan over the candles. From there he added the dry leaf, a pinch of something, and a measure of white powder. He added a splash of fluid I assumed was simply water, stirred, and poured the result through a filter and into a clear glass vial, stoppering it with a cork.\nHe held the result up for me to see: a clear amber liquid with a slight greenish tint. \u201cThere you go. Remind him to drink it all.\u201d\nI took the warm vial. \u201cWhat was this heirloom?\u201d\nCaudicus rinsed his hands in a porcelain bowl and shook them dry. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that on the oldest parts of the Lackless lands, in the oldest part of their ancestral estate, there is a secret door. A door without a handle or hinges.\u201d He watched me to make sure I was paying attention. \u201cThere\u2019s no way of opening it. It is locked, but at the same time, lockless. No one knows what\u2019s on the other side.\u201d\nHe nodded toward the vial in my hand. \u201cNow get that to the Maer. It\u2019ll be best if he drinks it while it\u2019s warm.\u201d He escorted me to the door. \u201cDo come back tomorrow.\u201d he smirked a bit. \u201cI know a story about the Menebras that will turn your red hair white.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I only work on one family at a time,\u201d I said, not wanting to risk getting bogged down in endless court gossip. \u201cTwo is the absolute most. Right now I\u2019m working on Alveron and Lackless. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to start a third as well.\u201d I gave an insipid smile. \u201cI\u2019d put myself all in a muddle.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a shame,\u201d Caudicus said. \u201cI travel quite a bit, you see. Many of the noble houses are eager to host the Maer\u2019s own arcanist.\u201d He gave me a sly look. \u201cThis makes me privy to some rather interesting facts.\u201d He opened the door. \u201cThink on it. And do stop back tomorrow. I\u2019ll have more on the Lacklesses at any rate.\u201d\nI was at the doors to the Maer\u2019s rooms before the vial had a chance to cool. Stapes opened the door to my knocking and led me to the Maer\u2019s inner rooms.\nThe Maer Alveron was sleeping in the same position I had left him in. As Stapes shut the door behind me, one of the Maer\u2019s eyes opened and he beckoned to me feebly. \u201cYou took your sweet time.\u201d\n\u201cYour grace, I\u2014\u201d\nHe motioned me forward again, more sharply this time. \u201cGive me my", "medicine,\u201d he said thickly. \u201cThen leave. I\u2019m tired.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s rather important, your grace.\u201d\nBoth eyes opened, and the smoldering anger was there again. \u201cWhat?\u201d he\nsnapped.\nI moved to the side of the bed and leaned close. Before he could protest my\nimpropriety, I whispered, \u201cYour grace, Caudicus is poisoning you.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER SIXTY": ["CHAPTER SIXTY\nWisdom\u2019s Tool\nTHE MAER\u2019S EYES WENT wide at my words, then narrowed again. Even in the midst of his infirmity, Alveron\u2019s wit was sharp. \u201cYou were right to speak that close and soft,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are treading dangerous ground. But speak, I will hear you.\u201d\n\u201cYour grace, I suspect Threpe did not mention in his letter that I am a student at the University as well as a musician.\u201d\nThe Maer\u2019s eyes showed no glimmer of recognition. \u201cWhich university?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cThe University, your grace,\u201d I said. \u201cI am a member of the Arcanum.\u201d\nAlveron frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re far too young to make such a claim. And why would Threpe neglect to mention this?\u201d\n\u201cYou were not looking for an arcanist, your grace. And there is a certain stigma attached to that sort of study this far east.\u201d It was the closest I could come to speaking the truth: that Vints are superstitious to the point of idiocy.\nThe Maer blinked slowly, his expression hardening. \u201cVery well,\u201d he said. \u201cPerform some work of magic if you are what you say.\u201d\n\u201cI am only an arcanist in training, your grace. But if you would like to see a bit of magic . . .\u201d I looked at the three lamps lining the walls, licked my fingers, concentrated, and pinched the wick of the candle sitting on his bedside table.\nThe room went dark and I heard his startled intake of breath. I brought out my silver ring, and after a moment it began to shine with a silver-blue light. My hands grew cold, as I had no source of heat other than my own body.\n\u201cThat will do,\u201d the Maer said. If he was at all unnerved, there was no hint of it in his voice.\nI stepped across the room and opened the shuttered windows. Sunlight flooded the room. There was a hint of selas flower, a trill of birdsong. \u201cI\u2019ve always found that taking in some air is good for whatever troubles a body, though others disagree.\u201d I smiled at him.", "He didn\u2019t return it. \u201cYes, yes. You\u2019re very clever. Come here and sit.\u201d I did so, taking a chair near his bedside. \u201cNow explain yourself.\u201d\n\u201cI told Caudicus I was compiling a collection of stories from the noble houses,\u201d I said. \u201cA handy excuse, as it also explains why I have been spending time with you.\u201d\nThe Maer\u2019s expression remained grim. I saw pain blur his eyes like a cloud passing in front of the sun. \u201cProof that you are a skilled liar hardly gains you my trust.\u201d\nA cold knot began to form in my stomach. I had assumed the Maer would accept the truth more easily than this. \u201cJust so, your grace. I lied to him and I am telling you the truth. Since he thought me nothing more than an idle lordling, he let me watch while he made your medicine.\u201d I held up the amber flask. The sunlight broke itself into rainbows on the glass.\nAlveron remained unmoved. His normally clear eyes fogged with confusion and pain. \u201cI ask for proof and you tell me a story. Caudicus has been a faithful servant for a dozen years. Nevertheless, I will consider what you\u2019ve said.\u201d His tone implied it would be a short, unkind consideration. He held out his hand for the vial.\nI felt a small flame of anger strike up inside me. It helped to ease the cold fear settling in my gut. \u201cYour grace wants proof?\u201d\n\u201cI want my medicine!\u201d he snapped. \u201cAnd I want to sleep. Please do\u2014\u201d \u201cYour grace, I can\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHow dare you interrupt me?\u201d Alveron struggled to sit upright in his bed,\nhis voice furious. \u201cYou go too far! Leave now and I may still consider retaining your services.\u201d He was trembling with rage, his hand still reaching for the vial.\nThere was a moment of silence. I held out the vial, but before he could grasp it, I said, \u201cYou have vomited recently. It was milky and white.\u201d\nThe tension in the room rose sharply, but the Maer went motionless when he heard what I said. \u201cYour tongue feels thick and heavy. Your mouth is dry and filled with an odd, sharp taste. You have had a craving for sweets, for sugar. You wake in the night and find you cannot move, cannot speak. You are struck with palsy, with colic and unreasoning panic.\u201d\nAs I spoke the Maer\u2019s hand slowly drew away from the vial. His expression was no longer livid and angry. His eyes seemed unsure, almost frightened, but they were clear again, as if the fear had awakened some sleeping caution.", "\u201cCaudicus told you,\u201d the Maer said, but he sounded far from certain.\n\u201cWould Caudicus discuss the details of your illness with a stranger?\u201d I asked pointedly. \u201cMy concern is for your life, your grace. If I must bruise propriety to save it, I will do so. Give me two minutes to speak and I will give you proof.\u201d\nAlveron gave a slow nod.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to claim to know exactly what this is.\u201d I gestured with the vial. \u201cBut most of what is poisoning you is lead. This accounts for the palsy, the pain in your muscles and viscera. The vomiting and paralysis.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve had no paralysis.\u201d\n\u201cHmmm.\u201d I looked him over with a critical eye. \u201cThat\u2019s fortunate. But there is more than simply lead in this. I\u2019m guessing this contains a goodly amount of ophalum, which isn\u2019t exactly poisonous.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it then?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s more of a medicine, or a drug.\u201d\n\u201cWhich is it then?\u201d he snapped. \u201cPoison or medicine?\u201d\n\u201cHas your grace ever taken laudanum?\u201d\n\u201cOnce when I was younger, to help me sleep through the pain of a broken\nleg.\u201d\n\u201cOphalum is a similar drug, but it is usually avoided as it is highly\naddictive.\u201d I paused. \u201cIt is also called denner resin.\u201d\nThe Maer grew paler at this, and in that moment his eyes grew almost\nperfectly clear. Everyone knew about the sweet-eaters.\n\u201cI suspect he added it because you had been irregular about taking your\nmedicine,\u201d I said. \u201cThe ophalum would make you crave it while easing your pain at the same time. It would also account for your sugar craving, your sweats, and any odd dreams you\u2019ve been having. What else did he put in here?\u201d I mused to myself. \u201cProbably stitchroot or mannum to keep you from vomiting too much. Clever. Horrible and clever.\u201d\n\u201cNot so clever.\u201d The Maer gave a rictus smile. \u201cHe didn\u2019t manage to kill me.\u201d\nI hesitated, then decided to tell him the truth. \u201cKilling you would have been simple, your grace. He could easily dissolve enough lead in this vial to kill you.\u201d I held it up to the light. \u201cGetting enough to make you sick without killing or paralyzing you, that is difficult.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? Why poison me if not to kill me?\u201d\n\u201cYour grace would have better luck solving that riddle. You know more", "about the politics involved.\u201d\n\u201cWhy poison me at all?\u201d The Maer sounded genuinely puzzled. \u201cI pay him\nlavishly. He is a member of the court in high regard. He has the freedom to pursue his own projects and travel when he wishes. He has lived here a dozen years. Why now?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI tell you it doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\u201cMoney?\u201d I suggested. \u201cThey say every man has a price.\u201d\nMaer continued to shake his head. Then he looked up suddenly. \u201cNo. I\u2019ve just remembered. I fell ill long before Caudicus began to treat me.\u201d He stopped to think. \u201cYes, that\u2019s right. I approached him to see if he could treat my illness. The symptoms you mentioned didn\u2019t appear until months after he started treating me. It couldn\u2019t have been him.\u201d\n\u201cLead works slowly in small doses, your grace. If he were going to poison you, he would hardly want you vomiting blood ten minutes after you drank his medicine.\u201d I suddenly remembered who I was talking to. \u201cThat was poorly said, your grace. I apologize.\u201d\nHe nodded a stiff acceptance. \u201cToo much of what you say is too close to the mark for me to ignore. Yet still, I can\u2019t believe Caudicus would do such a thing.\u201d\n\u201cWe can put it to the test, your grace.\u201d\nHe looked up at me. \u201cHow is that?\u201d\n\u201cOrder a half-dozen birds brought to your rooms. Sipquicks would be\nideal.\u201d\n\u201cSipquicks?\u201d\n\u201cTiny, bright things, yellow and red,\u201d I held up my fingers about two\ninches apart. \u201cThey\u2019re thick in your gardens. They drink the nectar from your selas flowers.\u201d\n\u201cOh. We call them flits.\u201d\n\u201cWe will mix your medicine with their nectar and see what happens.\u201d His expression grew bleak. \u201cIf lead works slowly, as you say, this would\ntake months. I\u2019ll not go without my medicine for months on some poorly supported fancy of yours.\u201d I saw his temper burning close to the surface of his voice.\n\u201cThey weigh much less than you, your grace, and their metabolisms are much faster. We should see results within a day or two at most.\u201d I hoped.\nHe seemed to consider this. \u201cVery well,\u201d he said, lifting a bell from his bedside table.\nI spoke quickly before he could ring it. \u201cMight I ask your grace to invent", "some reason for needing these birds? A little caution would serve us well.\u201d \u201cI have known Stapes forever,\u201d the Maer said firmly, his eyes as clear and\nsharp as I had ever seen them. \u201cI trust him with my lands, my lockbox, and my life. I do not ever wish to hear you imply he is anything other than perfectly trustworthy.\u201d There was unshakable belief in his voice.\nI dropped my eyes. \u201cYes, your grace.\u201d\nHe rang the bell, and it was barely two seconds before the portly manservant opened the door. \u201cYes sir?\u201d\n\u201cStapes, I miss being able to walk in the gardens. Could you find me a half-dozen flits?\u201d\n\u201cFlits, sir?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d the Maer said as if it he were ordering lunch. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty things. I think the sound of them will help me sleep.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do, sir.\u201d Before he closed the door, Stapes scowled at me.\nAfter the door was shut, I looked at the Maer. \u201cMight I ask your grace why?\u201d\n\u201cTo save him the trouble of lying. He hasn\u2019t the knack for it. And there is wisdom in what you said. Caution is always wisdom\u2019s tool.\u201d I saw a thin layer of perspiration covering his face.\n\u201cIf I am correct, your grace, tonight will be difficult for you.\u201d\n\u201cAll my nights are difficult of late,\u201d he said bitterly. \u201cWhat will make this one any worse than the last?\u201d\n\u201cThe ophalum, your grace. Your body is craving it. In two days you should be through the worst of it, but until then you will be in considerable . . . discomfort.\u201d\n\u201cSpeak plainly.\u201d\n\u201cThere will be aching in your jaw and head, sweating, nausea, cramps and spasms, especially in your legs and lower back. You may lose control of your bowels and there will be alternating periods of intense thirst and vomiting.\u201d I looked down at my hands. \u201cI am sorry, your grace.\u201d\nAlveron\u2019s expression was rather pinched by the end of my description, but he nodded graciously. \u201cI would rather know.\u201d\n\u201cThere are a few things that will make it slightly more tolerable, your grace.\u201d\nHe brightened a bit. \u201cSuch as?\u201d\n\u201cLaudanum for one. Just a bit, to ease your body\u2019s craving. And a few", "other things. Their names are unimportant. I can mix them into a tea for you. Another problem is that you still have a goodly deal of lead in your body that isn\u2019t going to go away on its own.\u201d\nThis seemed to alarm him more than anything I\u2019d said so far. \u201cWon\u2019t I simply pass it?\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cMetals are insidious poisons. They become trapped in your body. Only by a special effort can we leach the lead away.\u201d\nMaer scowled. \u201cDamn and bother. I hate leeches.\u201d\n\u201cA figure of speech, your grace. Only imbeciles and toad-eaters use leeches in this day and age. The lead needs to be drawn out of you.\u201d I thought about telling him the truth, that he would most likely never be rid of all of it, but decided to keep that bit of information to myself.\n\u201cCan you do it?\u201d\nI thought for a long moment. \u201cI am probably your best option, your grace. We are a long way from the University. I wager not one in ten physicians here have any respectable training, and I don\u2019t know who among them might know Caudicus.\u201d I thought for a moment longer then shook my head. \u201cI can think of fifty people better suited to the job, but they are a thousand miles away.\u201d\n\u201cI appreciate your honesty.\u201d\n\u201cMost of what I need I can find down in Severen-Low. However . . .\u201d I trailed off, hoping the Maer would understand my meaning and save me the embarrassment of asking for money.\nHe stared at me blankly. \u201cHowever?\u201d\n\u201cI will need money, your grace. The things you will need are not easy to come by.\u201d\n\u201cOh, of course.\u201d He produced a purse and passed it to me. I was a little surprised to find the Maer had at least one well-stocked purse within easy arm\u2019s reach of his bed. Unbidden, I remembered my tirade to a tailor in Tarbean years ago. What had I said to him? A gentleman is never far from his purse? I fought down an inappropriate fit of laughter.\nStapes returned shortly after that. In a surprising display of resourcefulness, he produced a dozen sipquicks in a wheeled cage the size of a wardrobe.\n\u201cMy word, Stapes,\u201d the Maer exclaimed as his manservant rolled the fine mesh cage through the doorway. \u201cYou\u2019ve outdone yourself.\u201d\n\u201cWhere would it suit you best, sir?\u201d", "\u201cJust leave it there for now. I\u2019ll have Kvothe move it for me.\u201d\nStapes looked a trifle wounded. \u201cIt\u2019s no trouble.\u201d\n\u201cI know you\u2019d be glad to do it, Stapes. But I was hoping you would fetch\nme a fresh pitcher of appledraw instead. I think it might settle my stomach.\u201d \u201cCertainly.\u201d He hurried out again, closing the door behind him.\nAs soon as the door was closed, I moved to the cage. The little gemlike\nbirds darted from perch to perch with a blurring speed. \u201cPretty things,\u201d I heard the Maer muse. \u201cI was fascinated with them as a child. I remember thinking how wonderful it must be to eat nothing but sugar all day.\u201d\nThere were three feeders wired to the outside of the cage, glass tubes filled with sugar-water. Two of them had spouts shaped like tiny selas blooms, while the third was a stylized iris. The perfect pet for nobility. Who else could afford to feed their pet sugar every day?\nI unscrewed the tops of the feeders and poured a third of the Maer\u2019s medicine into each. I held out the empty vial to Alveron. \u201cWhat do you normally do with these?\u201d\nHe set it on the table near his bed.\nI watched the cage until I saw one of the birds fly to a feeder and drink. \u201cIf you tell Stapes you want to feed them yourself, will it keep him from meddling with their food?\u201d\n\u201cYes. He always does exactly as I tell him.\u201d\n\u201cGood. Let them drain the feeders before you refill them. They\u2019ll get a better dose that way, and we\u2019ll see results faster. Where do you want me to put the cage?\u201d\nHe looked around the room, his eyes moving sluggishly. \u201cNext to the chest of drawers in the sitting room,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI should be able to see the cage from here.\u201d\nI carefully rolled the cage into the next room. When I returned, I found Stapes pouring the Maer a glass of appledraw.\nI made a bow to Alveron. \u201cWith your permission, your grace.\u201d\nHe made a gesture of dismissal. \u201cStapes, Kvothe will be returning later this afternoon. Let him in, even if I happen to be sleeping.\u201d\nStapes nodded stiffly and gave me another disapproving look.\n\u201cHe may be bringing me a few things as well. Please don\u2019t mention it to anyone.\u201d\n\u201cIf there is anything you require . . .\u201d\nAlveron gave a tired smile. \u201cI know you would, Stapes. I am simply", "putting the boy to use. I would rather have you close at hand.\u201d Alveron patted his manservant\u2019s arm, and Stapes looked mollified. I let myself out.\nMy trip to Severen-Low took hours longer than it needed to. Though I chafed at the delay, it was a necessary one. As I walked the streets, I caught glimpses of folk dogging along behind me.\nI wasn\u2019t surprised. From what I had seen of the rumor-driven nature of the Maer\u2019s court, I expected to have a servant or two watching my errands in Severen-Low. As I\u2019ve said, the Maer\u2019s court was rather curious about me at this point, and you have no idea what lengths bored nobility will go to in order to nose about in other people\u2019s business.\nWhile the rumors themselves were of no concern to me, their effects could be catastrophic. If Caudicus heard I had gone shopping through apothecaries after visiting the Maer, what steps would he take? Anyone willing to poison the Maer wouldn\u2019t hesitate to snuff me like a candle.\nSo, to avoid suspicion, the first thing I did when I came to Severen was buy dinner. Good, hot stew and rough bread. I was sick to death of elegant food that was milk-warm by the time it made its way to my rooms.\nAfterward I bought two tippling flasks, the sort normally used for brandy. Then I spent a relaxing half-hour watching a small traveling troupe perform the end of The Ghost and the Goosegirl on a street corner. They weren\u2019t Edema Ruh, but they did a good job of it. The Maer\u2019s purse was generous to them when they passed the hat.\nEventually I found my way to a well-stocked apothecary. I bought several things in a nervous, haphazard manner. After I had everything I needed and a few things I didn\u2019t, I awkwardly made inquiries with the owner about what a man might take if he was . . . having certain troubles . . . in the bedroom.\nThe chemist nodded seriously and recommended several things with a perfectly straight face. I bought a little of each, then made a bumbling attempt to threaten and bribe him into silence. By the time I finally left, he was insulted and thoroughly irritated. If anyone asked, he would be quick to tell the story of a rude gentleman interested in impotence cures. It was hardly something I was eager to add to my reputation, but at least there wouldn\u2019t be any stories making their way back to Caudicus about my purchasing\n \nlaudanum, deadnettle, bitefew, and other equally suspicious drugs.\nLastly, I bought my lute back from the pawner with an entire day to spare.\nIt nearly emptied the Maer\u2019s purse, but it was my final errand. The sun was setting by the time I made my way back to the foot of the Sheer.\nThere were only a handful of options for making your way between Severen-High and Severen-Low. The most ordinary were the two narrow staircases that cut back and forth up the face of the Sheer. They were old, crumbling, and narrow in places, but they were free, and therefore the usual choice for the common folk who lived in Severen-Low.\nFor those who didn\u2019t relish the thought of climbing two hundred feet of narrow stairway, there were other options. The freight lifts were run by a pair of former University students. Not full arcanists, but clever men who knew enough sympathy and engineering to manage the rather mundane task of hauling wagons and horses up and down the Sheer on a large wooden platform.\nFor passengers, the freights cost a penny going up and a halfpenny going down, though you\u2019d occasionally have to wait for some merchant to finish loading or unloading his goods before the lift could make its trip.\nNobility didn\u2019t use the freights. The Vintic suspicion of all things remotely arcane took them to the horse lifts. These were drawn by a team of twenty horses hitched to a complex series of pulleys. This meant the horse lifts were a little faster and cost a full silver eighth-bit to ride. Best of all, every month or so some drunk lordling would fall to his death from them, adding to their popularity by showing the breeding of the clientele.\nSince the money in my purse wasn\u2019t my own, I decided to use the horse lifts.\nI joined the four gentlemen and one lady who were already in line, waited for the lift to lower itself, then handed over my thin silver bit and stepped aboard.\nIt was no more than an open-sided box with a brass rail running around the edge. Thick hempen ropes connected to the corners, giving it some stability, but any extreme motion set the thing swaying in a most disturbing fashion. A smartly dressed boy rode up and down with each load of passengers, opening the gate and signaling the horse drivers at the top when to begin their pull.\nIt is the custom of the nobility to put their backs to Severen as they ride the lifts. Gawking was something common folk did. Not particularly caring what the nobles thought of me, I stood at the front rail. My stomach did peculiar", "things as we rose from the ground.\nI watched Severen spread out below. It was an old city, and proud. The\nhigh stone wall circling it spoke of troubled times long past. It said much of the Maer that even in these peaceful times the fortifications were kept in excellent repair. All three of the gates were guarded, and they were closed at sundown every night.\nAs the lift continued I could see the different sections of Severen as clearly as if I were looking down on a map. There was a rich neighborhood, spaced with gardens and parks, the buildings all of brick and old stone. There was the poor quarter, the streets narrow and twisting, where all the roofs were tar and wooden shingles. At the foot of the cliff a black scar marked where a fire had cut through the city at some point in the past, leaving little more than the charred bones of buildings.\nToo soon the ride was over. I let the other gentles disembark as I leaned against the railing, looking out over the city far below.\n\u201cSir?\u201d the boy who rode the lift prompted wearily. \u201cAll off.\u201d\nI turned, stepped off the lift, and saw Denna standing in the front of the line.\nBefore I had time to do anything other than stare in wonder, she turned and met my eyes. Her face lit. She cried my name, ran at me, and was nestled in my arms before I knew what was happening. I settled my arms around her and rested my cheek against her ear. We came together easily, as if we were dancers. As if we\u2019d practiced it a thousand times. She was warm and soft.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked. Her heart was racing, and I felt it thrilling against my chest.\nI stood mutely as she stepped back from me. Only then did I notice an old bruise fading to yellow high on her cheek. Even so, she was the most beautiful thing I had seen in two months and a thousand miles. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I asked.\nShe laughed her silver laugh and reached out to touch my arm. Then her eyes flicked over my shoulder and her face fell. \u201cHold on!\u201d she cried to the boy who was closing the gate to the lift. \u201cI have to catch this one or I\u2019ll be late,\u201d she said, her face full of pained apology as she stepped past me onto the lift. \u201cCome find me.\u201d\nThe boy closed the gate behind her and my heart fell as the lift began to drop from sight. \u201cWhere should I look?\u201d I stepped closer to the edge of the Sheer, watching her fall away.", "She was looking up, her face white against the darkness, her hair a shadow in the night. \u201cThe second street north of Main: Tinnery Street.\u201d\nShadow took her, and suddenly I was alone. I stood, the smell of her still in the air around me, the warmth of her just fading from my hands. I could still feel the tremor of her heart, like a caged bird beating against my chest.", ""], "CHAPTER SIXTY-ONE": ["CHAPTER SIXTY-ONE\nDeadnettle\nAFTER MY TRIP TO Severen, I deposited my lute case in my room and made my way to Alveron\u2019s private rooms as quickly as possible. Stapes was not pleased to see me, but he showed me in with the same bustling efficiency as always.\nAlveron lay in a sweaty stupor, his bedclothes twisted around him. It was only then I noticed how thin he had grown. His arms and legs were stringy and his complexion had faded from pale to grey. He glowered at me as I entered the room.\nStapes arranged the Maer\u2019s covers in a more modest fashion and helped him into a seated position, propping him up with pillows. The Maer endured these ministrations stoically, then said, \u201cThank you, Stapes,\u201d in a tone of dismissal. The manservant left slowly, giving me a decidedly uncivil stare.\nI approached the Maer\u2019s bed and brought several items from the pockets of my cloak. \u201cI found everything I needed, your grace. Though not everything I hoped for. How do you feel?\u201d\nHe gave me a look that spoke volumes. \u201cIt took you a damn long time getting back. Caudicus came while you were away.\u201d\nI fought down a wave of anxiety. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cHe asked me how I was feeling, and I told him the truth. He looked in my eyes and down my throat and asked me if I had thrown up. I told him yes, and that I wanted more medicine and to be left alone. He left and sent some over.\u201d\nI felt a panic rise in me. \u201cDid you drink it?\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019d been gone much longer I would have, and to hell with your faerie stories.\u201d He brought another vial from beneath his pillow. \u201cI can\u2019t see what harm it could do. I can feel myself dying already.\u201d He thrust it toward me angrily.\n\u201cI should be able to improve matters, your grace. Remember, tonight will be the most difficult. Tomorrow will be bad. After that, all should be well.\u201d", "\u201cIf I live so long as that,\u201d he groused.\nIt was just the petulant grumble of a sick man, but it mirrored my thoughts so precisely that ice ran down my back. Earlier, I hadn\u2019t considered that the Maer might die despite my intervention. But when I looked at him now, frail and grey and trembling, I realized the truth: he might not live through the night.\n\u201cFirst, there\u2019s this, your grace.\u201d I took out the tippling flask.\n\u201cBrandy?\u201d he said with muted anticipation. I shook my head and opened it. He wrinkled his nose at the smell and sank back onto the pillows. \u201cGod\u2019s teeth. As if my dying wasn\u2019t bad enough. Cod liver oil?\u201d\nI nodded seriously. \u201cTake two good swallows, your grace. This is part of your cure.\u201d\nHe made no move to take it. \u201cI\u2019ve never been able to stomach the stuff, and lately I even vomit up my tea. I won\u2019t put myself through the hell of drinking it only to sick it back up.\u201d\nI nodded and restoppered the flask. \u201cI\u2019ll give you something to stop that.\u201d There was a pot of water on the bedside table, and I began to mix him a cup of tea.\nHe craned weakly to see what I was doing. \u201cWhat are you putting in that?\u201d\n\u201cSomething to keep you from being sick, and something to help you pass the poison out of your system. A bit of laudanum to ease your craving. And tea. Does your grace take sugar?\u201d\n\u201cNormally, no. But I\u2019m guessing it will taste like stumpwater without it.\u201d I added a spoonful, stirred, and handed him the cup.\n\u201cYou first,\u201d Alveron said. Pale and grim, he watched me with his sharp grey eyes. He smiled a terrible smile.\nI hesitated, but only for a moment. \u201cTo your grace\u2019s health.\u201d I said, and took a good swallow. I grimaced and added another spoonful of sugar. \u201cYour grace predicted it quite well. Stumpwater it is.\u201d\nHe took the cup with both hands and began to drink it in a number of quick, determined sips. \u201cDreadful,\u201d he said simply. \u201cBut better than nothing. Do you know what a hell it is to be thirsty but not be able to drink for fear of throwing up? I wouldn\u2019t wish it on a dog.\u201d\n\u201cWait a bit to finish it,\u201d I cautioned. \u201cThat should settle your stomach in a few minutes.\u201d\nI went into the other room and added the new vial of medicine to the flit\u2019s feeders. I was relieved to see they were still sipping at the medicated nectar. I", "had worried they might avoid it due to a change in flavor or some natural instinct for self-preservation.\nI also worried that lead might not be poisonous to sipquicks. I worried they might take a span to show any ill effects, not mere days I worried at the Maer\u2019s rising temper. I worried at his illness. I worried at the possibility I might be wrong about everything I\u2019d guessed.\nI returned to the Maer\u2019s bedside and found him cradling the empty cup in his lap. I mixed a second cup similar to the first, and he drank it quickly. Then we sat in silence for the space of fifteen minutes or so.\n\u201cHow do you feel, your grace?\u201d\n\u201cBetter,\u201d he admitted grudgingly. I detected a slight dullness to his speech. \u201cMuch better.\u201d\n\u201cThat is probably the laudanum,\u201d I commented. \u201cBut your stomach should be settled by now.\u201d I picked up the flask of cod liver oil. \u201cTwo good swallows, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cIs this really the only thing that will do?\u201d he asked distastefully.\n\u201cIf I had access to the apothecaries near the University, I could find something more palatable, but at the moment this is the only thing that can be done.\u201d\n\u201cGet me another cup of tea to wash it down with.\u201d He picked up the flask, took two sips, and handed it back, his mouth turned down in a ghastly expression.\nI sighed internally. \u201cIf you are going to sip it, we will be here all evening. Two solid swallows, the kind sailors use to drink cheap whiskey.\u201d\nHe scowled. \u201cDon\u2019t speak to me as if I were a child.\u201d\n\u201cThen act the part of a man,\u201d I said harshly, stunning him to silence. \u201cTwo swallows every four hours. That whole flask should be finished by tomorrow.\u201d\nHis grey eyes narrowed dangerously. \u201cI would remind you who you are speaking to.\u201d\n\u201cI am speaking to a sick man who will not take his medicine,\u201d I said levelly.\nAnger smoldered behind his laudanum-dulled eyes. \u201cA pint of fish oil is not medicine,\u201d he hissed. \u201cIt is a malicious and unreasonable request. It can\u2019t be done.\u201d\nI fixed him with my best withering stare and took the flask out of his hand. Without looking away, I drank the whole thing down. Swallow after swallow", "of the oil passed my gullet as I held the Maer\u2019s eye. I watched his face shift from angry to disgusted, then finally settle into an expression of muted, sickened awe. I upended the flask, ran my finger around the inside of it and licked it clean.\nI pulled out a second flask from a pocket of my cloak. \u201cThis was going to be your dose for tomorrow, but you will need to use it tonight. If you find it easier, one swallow every two hours should suffice.\u201d I held it out to him, still holding his eyes with mine.\nHe took it mutely, drank two good swallows, and stoppered the flask with a grim determination. Pride is always a better lever against the nobility than reason.\nI fished in one of the pockets of my rich burgundy cloak and brought out the Maer\u2019s ring. \u201cI forgot to return this to you before, your grace.\u201d I held it out to him.\nHe began to reach out for it, then stopped. \u201cKeep it for now,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve earned that much, I imagine.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, your grace,\u201d I said, careful to keep my expression composed. He wasn\u2019t inviting me to wear the ring, but allowing me to keep it was a tangible step forward in our relationship. No matter how his courtship of the Lady Lackless went, I had made an impression on him today.\nI poured him more tea and decided to finish his instructions while I had his attention. \u201cYou should drink the rest of this potful tonight, your grace. But remember, it\u2019s all you\u2019ll have until tomorrow. When you send for me, I\u2019ll brew you some more. You should try to drink as many fluids as you can tonight. Milk would be best. Put some honey in it and it will go down easier.\u201d\nHe agreed and seemed to be easing toward sleep. Knowing how difficult his night would be, I let him nod off. I gathered my things before letting myself out.\nStapes was waiting in the outer rooms. I mentioned to him that the Maer was sleeping, and told him not to toss out the tea in the pot, as his grace would be wanting it when he woke up.\nAs I left, the look Stapes gave me was not merely chilly, as it had been before. It was hateful, practically venomous. Only after he closed the door behind me did I realize what this must look like to him. He assumed I was taking advantage of the Maer in his time of weakness.\nThere are a great many such people in the world, traveling physicians with no qualms about preying on the fears of the desperately ill. The best example", "of this is Deadnettle, the potion seller in Three Pennies for Wishing. Easily one of the most despised characters in all drama, there\u2019s no audience that doesn\u2019t cheer when Deadnettle gets pilloried in the fourth act.\nWith that in mind, I began to dwell on how fragile and grey the Maer had looked. Living in Tarbean, I had seen healthy young men killed by ophalum withdrawal, and the Maer was neither young nor healthy.\nIf he did die, who would be blamed? Certainly not Caudicus, trusted advisor. Certainly not Stapes, beloved manservant. . . .\nMe. They would blame me. His condition had worsened soon after I arrived. I didn\u2019t doubt Stapes would quickly bring to light the fact that I\u2019d been spending time alone with the Maer in his rooms. That I\u2019d brewed him a pot of tea right before he had a very traumatic night.\nAt best I would look like a young Deadnettle. At worst, an assassin.\nSuch was the turning of my thoughts as I made my way through the Maer\u2019s estate back to my rooms, pausing only to lean out one of the windows overlooking Severen-Low and vomit up a pint of cod liver oil.", ""], "CHAPTER SIXTY-TWO": ["CHAPTER SIXTY-TWO\nCrisis\nTHE NEXT MORNING I made my way to Severen-Low before the sun was up. I ate a hot breakfast of eggs and potatoes while I waited for an apothecary to open. When I was finished, I bought two more pints of cod liver oil and a few other oddments I hadn\u2019t thought of the day before.\nThen I walked the entire length of Tinnery Street, hoping to stumble onto Denna despite the fact that it was far too early in the morning for her to be up and about. Wagons and farmers\u2019 carts vied for space on the cobbled streets. Ambitious beggars were laying claim to the busiest corners while shopkeepers hung out their shingles and threw wide their shutters.\nI counted twenty-three inns and boarding houses on Tinnery Street. After making note of the ones Denna would probably find appealing, I forced myself back to the Maer\u2019s estates. This time I took the freight lifts, partly to confuse anyone following me, but also because the purse the Maer had given me was nearly empty.\nSince I needed to keep a normal face on things, I remained in my rooms, waiting for the Maer to send for me. I sent my card and ring to Bredon, and soon he was sitting across from me, thrashing me at tak and telling stories.\n\u201c. . . so the Maer had him hung in a gibbet. Right alongside the eastern gate. Hung here for days, howling and cursing. Saying he was innocent. Saying it wasn\u2019t right and how he wanted a trial.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t quite bring myself to believe it. \u201cA gibbet?\u201d\nBredon nodded seriously. \u201cAn actual iron gibbet. Who knows where he managed to find one in this day and age. It was like something out of a play.\u201d\nI searched for something relatively noncommittal to say. While it did sound grotesque, I also knew better than to openly criticize the Maer. \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cbanditry is a terrible thing.\u201d\nBredon began to place a stone on the board, then reconsidered. \u201cQuite a few folks thought the whole thing was in rather . . .\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cBad taste. But nobody said so very loudly, if you catch my meaning. It was", "a grisly thing. But it got the point across.\u201d\nHe finally chose the placement of his stone, and we played quietly for a\ntime.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strange thing,\u201d I said. \u201cI ran into someone the other day who didn\u2019t\nknow where Caudicus would rank in the overall scheme of things.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not terribly surprising,\u201d Bredon gestured to the board. \u201cThe giving\nand receiving of rings is a lot like tak. On the face of it, the rules are simple. In execution they become quite complicated.\u201d He clicked down a stone, his dark eyes crinkling with amusement. \u201cIn fact, the other day I was explaining the intricacies of the custom to a foreigner not familiar with such things.\u201d\n\u201cThat was kind of you,\u201d I said.\nBredon gave a gracious nod. \u201cIt seems simple at first glance,\u201d he said. \u201cA baron ranks above a baronet. But sometimes young money is worth more than old blood. Sometimes control of a river is more important than how many soldiers you can put to field. Sometimes a person is actually more than one person, technically speaking. The Earl of Svanis is, by strange inheritance, also the Viscount of Tevn. One man, but two different political entities.\u201d\nI smiled. \u201cMy mother once told me she knew a man who owed fealty to himself,\u201d I said. \u201cOwed himself a share of his own taxes every year, and if he were ever threatened, there were treaties in place demanding he provide himself with prompt and loyal military support.\u201d\nBredon nodded. \u201cIt happens more often than folk realize,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially with the older families. Stapes, for example, exists in several separate capacities.\u201d\n\u201cStapes?\u201d I asked. \u201cBut he\u2019s just a manservant, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Bredon said slowly. \u201cHe is that. But he\u2019s hardly just a manservant. His family is quite old, but he has no title of his own. Technically, he ranks no higher than a cook. But he owns substantial lands. He has money. And he is the Maer\u2019s manservant. They\u2019ve known each other since they were boys. Everyone knows he has Alveron\u2019s ear.\u201d\nBredon\u2019s dark eyes peered at me. \u201cWho would dare insult such a man with an iron ring? Go to his room and you will see the truth: there is nothing in his bowl but gold.\u201d\n \nBredon excused himself shortly after our game, claiming a prior engagement. Luckily, I now had my lute to occupy my time. I set about retuning it, checking the frets, and fussing over the tuning peg that was constantly coming loose. We had been away from each other for a long while, and it takes time to get reacquainted.\nHours passed. I discovered myself absentmindedly playing \u201cDeadnettle\u2019s Lament\u201d and forced myself to stop. Noon came and went. Lunch was delivered and cleared away. I retuned my lute and ran some scales. Before I knew it I found myself playing \u201cLeave the Town, Tinker.\u201d Only then did I realize what my hands were trying to tell me. If the Maer was still alive, he would have called for me by now.\nI let the lute fall silent and began to think very quickly. I needed to leave. Now. Stapes had seen me bring medicine to the Maer. I could even be accused of tampering with the vial I had brought from Caudicus\u2019 rooms.\nSlow fear began to knot my gut as I realized the helplessness of my situation. I didn\u2019t know the Maer\u2019s estates well enough to attempt a clever escape. On my way to Severen-Low this morning, I\u2019d gotten turned around and had to stop to ask directions.\nThe knock on the door was louder than usual, more forceful than that of the errand boy who normally came to deliver the Maer\u2019s invitation. Guards. I froze in my seat. Would it be best to answer the door and tell the truth? Or duck out the window into the garden and somehow try to make a run for it?\nThe knock came again, louder. \u201cSir? Sir?\u201d\nThe voice was muffled by the door, but it was not a guard\u2019s voice. I opened the door and saw a young boy carrying a tray with the Maer\u2019s iron ring and card.\nI picked them up. The card had a single word written in a shaky hand: Immediately.\nStapes looked uncharacteristically ragged around the edges and greeted me with an icy stare. Yesterday he\u2019d looked as if he wanted me dead and buried. Today his look implied that simply buried would be good enough.\nThe Maer\u2019s bedroom was generously decorated with selas flowers. Their\n \ndelicate smell was almost enough to cover the odors they\u2019d been brought in to conceal. Combined with Stapes\u2019 appearance, I knew my predictions of the night\u2019s unpleasantness had been close to the truth.\nAlveron was propped into a sitting position in his bed. He looked as well as could be expected, which is to say exhausted, but no longer sweating and racked with pain. As a matter of fact, he looked almost angelic. A rectangle of sunlight washed over him, lending his skin a frail translucency and making his disarrayed hair shine like a silver crown around his head.\nAs I stepped closer he opened his eyes, breaking the beatific illusion. No angel ever had eyes as clever as Alveron\u2019s.\n\u201cI trust I find your grace well?\u201d I asked politely.\n\u201cPassing fair,\u201d he responded. But it was mere social noise, telling me nothing.\n\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d I asked in a more serious tone.\nHe gave me a long look that let me know he did not approve of my addressing him so casually, then said. \u201cOld. I feel old and weak.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cBut for all that, I feel better than I have in several days. A little pain, and I am mightily tired. But I feel . . . clean. I think I\u2019ve passed the crisis.\u201d\nI did not ask about last night. \u201cWould you like me to mix you another pot of tea?\u201d\n\u201cPlease.\u201d His tone was measured and polite. Unable to guess his mood, I hurried through the preparations and handed him his cup.\nHe looked up at me after sampling it. \u201cThis tastes different.\u201d\n\u201cThere is less laudanum in it,\u201d I explained. \u201cToo much would be harmful to your grace. Your body would begin to depend on it as surely as it craved the ophalum.\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cYou\u2019ll note my birds are doing well,\u201d he said in an overly casual tone.\nI looked through the doorway and saw the sipquicks darting about in their gilded cage, lively as ever. I felt a chill at the implication of his comment. He still didn\u2019t believe Caudicus was poisoning him.\nI was too stunned to make a quick reply, but after a breath or two I managed to say, \u201cTheir health does not concern me nearly so much as your own. You do feel better, don\u2019t you, your grace?\u201d\n\u201cThat is the nature of my illness. It comes and goes.\u201d The Maer set down his cup of tea, still three-quarters full. \u201cEventually it fades entirely, and", "Caudicus is free to go off gallivanting for months at a time, gathering ingredients for his charms and potives. Speaking of,\u201d he said, folding his hands in his lap. \u201cWould you do me the favor of fetching my medicine from Caudicus?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly, your grace.\u201d I stretched a smile over my face, trying to ignore the unease settling in my chest. I cleaned up the clutter I had created while fixing his tea, tucking packages and bundles of herbs back into the pockets of my burgundy cloak.\nThe Maer nodded graciously, then closed his eyes and seemed to lapse back into his tranquil, sunlit nap.\n\u201cOur fledgling historian!\u201d Caudicus said as he gestured me inside and offered me a seat. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me for a moment, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\nI sank into the padded chair and only then noticed the array of rings on the nearby table. Caudicus had gone so far as to have a rack built for them. Each was displayed with the name facing outward. There were a great many of them, silver, iron, and gold.\nBoth my gold ring and Alveron\u2019s iron one sat on a small tray on the table. I reclaimed them, taking note of this rather graceful way of wordlessly offering the return of a ring.\nI looked around the large tower room with muted curiosity. What possible motive could he have for poisoning the Maer? Barring access to the University itself, this place was every arcanist\u2019s dream.\nCurious, I got to my feet and wandered to his bookshelves. Caudicus had a respectable library, with nearly a hundred books crowding for space. I recognized many of the titles. Some were chemical references. Some were alchemical. Others dealt with the natural sciences, herbology, physiology, bestiology. The vast majority seemed to be historical in nature.\nA thought occurred to me. Perhaps I could get the native Vintish superstition to work to my advantage. If Caudicus was a serious scholar and even half as superstitious as a native Vint, he might know something about the Chandrian. Best of all, since I was playing the dimwitted lordling, I didn\u2019t need to worry about damaging my reputation.\nCaudicus came around the corner and seemed somewhat taken aback when\n \nhe saw me standing by the bookshelves. But he rallied quickly and gave me a polite smile. \u201cSee anything you\u2019re interested in?\u201d\nI turned, shaking my head. \u201cNot particularly,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you know anything about the Chandrian?\u201d\nCaudicus looked at me blankly for a moment, then burst out laughing. \u201cI know they\u2019re not going to come into your room at night and steal you out of your bed,\u201d he said, wiggling his fingers at me, the way you\u2019d tease a child.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t study mythology then?\u201d I asked, fighting down a wave of disappointment at his reaction. I tried to console myself with the fact that this would firmly solidify me as a half-wit lordling in his mind.\nCaudicus sniffed. \u201cThat\u2019s hardly mythology,\u201d he said dismissively. \u201cOne could barely even stoop to calling it folklore. It\u2019s superstitious bunk, and I don\u2019t waste my time with it. No serious scholar would.\u201d\nHe began to putter around the room, restoppering bottles and tucking them into cabinets, straightening up stacks of papers, and returning books to their shelves. \u201cSpeaking of serious scholarship, if I remember correctly, you were curious about the Lackless family?\u201d\nI simply stared at him for a moment. With everything that had happened since, I\u2019d all but forgotten the pretense of the anecdotal genealogy I\u2019d invented yesterday.\n\u201cIf it wouldn\u2019t be any trouble,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said, I know practically nothing of them.\u201d\nCaudicus nodded seriously. \u201cIn that case you might be well-served in considering their name.\u201d He adjusted an alcohol lamp underneath a simmering glass alembic in the midst of an impressive array of copper tubing. Whatever he was distilling, I guessed it wasn\u2019t peach brandy. \u201cYou see, names can tell you a great deal about a thing.\u201d\nI grinned at that, then fought to smother the expression. \u201cYou don\u2019t say?\u201d\nHe turned back to face me just as I got my mouth under control. \u201cOh yes,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see, names are sometimes based on other, older names. The older the name, the closer it lies to the truth. Lackless is a relatively new name for the family, not much more than six hundred years old.\u201d\nFor once I didn\u2019t have to feign amazement. \u201cSix hundred years is new?\u201d\n\u201cThe Lackless family is old.\u201d He stopped his pacing and settled down into a threadbare armchair. \u201cMuch older than the house of Alveron. A thousand years ago the Lackless family enjoyed a power at least as great as Alveron\u2019s. Pieces of what are now Vintas, Modeg, and a large portion of the small", "kingdoms were all Lackless lands at one point.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was their name before that?\u201d I asked.\nHe pulled down a thick book and flipped its pages impatiently. \u201cHere it is.\nThe family was called Loeclos or Loklos, or Loeloes. They all translate the same, Lockless. Spelling was rather less important in those days.\u201d\n\u201cWhat days were those?\u201d I asked.\nHe consulted the book again. \u201cAbout nine hundred years ago, but I\u2019ve seen other histories that mention the Loeclos a thousand years before the fall of Atur.\u201d\nI boggled at the thought of a family older than empires. \u201cSo the Lockless family became the Lackless family? What reason could a family have for changing its name?\u201d\n\u201cThere are historians who would cut off their own right hands to answer that,\u201d Caudicus said. \u201cIt\u2019s generally accepted that there was some sort of falling out that splintered the family. Each piece took on a separate name. In Atur they became the Lack-key family.They were numerous, but fell on hard times. That\u2019s where the word \u2018lackey\u2019 comes from, you know. All those paupered nobility forced to scrape and bow to make ends meet.\n\u201cIn the south they became the Lacliths, who slowly spiraled into obscurity. The same with the Kaepcaen in Modeg. The largest piece of the family was here in Vintas, except Vintas didn\u2019t exist back then.\u201d He closed the book and held it out to me. \u201cYou can borrow this if you\u2019d like.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d I took the book. \u201cYou\u2019re too kind.\u201d\nThere was the distant sound of a belling tower. \u201cI\u2019m too long-winded,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve talked away our time and haven\u2019t given you anything of use.\u201d\n\u201cJust the history makes a great difference,\u201d I said gratefully.\n\u201cAre you sure I can\u2019t interest you in a few stories from other families?\u201d he asked, walking over to a worktable. \u201cI wintered with the Jakis family not long ago. The baron is a widower you know. Quite wealthy and somewhat eccentric.\u201d He raised both eyebrows at me, his eyes wide with implied scandal. \u201cI\u2019m sure I could remember a few interesting things if I were assured of my anonymity.\u201d\nI was tempted to break character for that, but instead I shook my head. \u201cPerhaps when I\u2019m done working on the Lackless section,\u201d I said with all the self-importance of someone devoted to a truly useless project. \u201cMy research is quite delicate. I don\u2019t want to get tangled up in my head.\u201d\nCaudicus frowned a bit, then shrugged it away as he rolled up his sleeves", "and began to make the Maer\u2019s medicine.\nI watched him go through his preparations again. It wasn\u2019t alchemy. I\nknew that from watching Simmon work. This was barely even chemistry. Mixing a medicine like this was closer to following a recipe than anything. But what were the ingredients?\nI watched him move through it step by step. The dried leaf was probably bitefew. The liquid from the stoppered jar was no doubt muratum or aqua fortis, some sort of acid at any rate. When it bubbled and steamed in the lead bowl it dissolved a small amount of lead, maybe only a quarter-scruple. The white powder was probably the ophalum.\nHe added a pinch of the final ingredient. I couldn\u2019t even guess what that was. It looked like salt, but then again, most everything looks like salt.\nAs he went through the motions, Caudicus nattered on about court gossip. DeFerre\u2019s eldest son had broken his leg jumping out a brothel window. Lady Hesua\u2019s most recent lover was Yllish and didn\u2019t speak a word of Aturan. There was a rumor of highwaymen on the king\u2019s road to the north, but there are always rumors of bandits, so that was nothing new.\nI don\u2019t care one whit for gossip, but I can fake interest when I must. All the while I watched Caudicus for some telltale sign. Some whisper of nervousness, a bead of sweat, a moment\u2019s hesitation. But there was nothing. Not the slightest indication he was preparing a poison for the Maer. He was perfectly comfortable, utterly at ease.\nWas it possible he was poisoning the Maer by accident? Impossible. Any arcanist worth his guilder knew enough chemistry to . . .\nThen it dawned on me. Maybe Caudicus wasn\u2019t an arcanist at all. Maybe he was simply a man in a dark robe who didn\u2019t know the difference between an alligator and a crocodile. Maybe he was just a clever pretender who happened to be poisoning the Maer out of simple ignorance.\nMaybe that was peach brandy in his distillery.\nHe tamped the cork into the vial of amber liquid and handed it to me. \u201cThere you are,\u201d he said. \u201cMake sure you take it to him straightaway. It\u2019ll be best if he gets it while it\u2019s still warm.\u201d\nThe temperature of a medicine doesn\u2019t make one whit of difference. Any physicker knows that.\nI took the vial and pointed to his chest as if I\u2019d just noticed something. \u201cMy word, is that an amulet?\u201d\nHe seemed confused at first, then and drew out the leather cord from", "underneath his robes. \u201cOf sorts,\u201d he said with a tolerant smile. At a casual glance, the piece of lead he wore around his neck looked very much like an Arcanum guilder.\n\u201cDoes it protect you from spirits?\u201d I asked in a hushed voice. \u201cOh yes,\u201d he said flippantly. \u201cAll sorts.\u201d\nI swallowed nervously. \u201cMay I touch it?\u201d\nHe shrugged and leaned forward, holding it out to me.\nI took it timidly with my thumb and forefinger, then jumped back a step. \u201cIt bit me!\u201d I said, pitching my voice somewhere between indignation and anxiety as I wrung my hand.\nI saw him fighting down a smile. \u201cAh, yes. I need to feed it, I suspect.\u201d He tucked it back inside his robes. \u201cGo on now.\u201d He made a shooing motion toward the door.\nI made my way back to the Maer\u2019s rooms, trying to massage some feeling back into my numb fingers. It was a genuine Arcanum guilder. He was a real arcanist. He knew exactly what he was doing.\nI returned to the Maer\u2019s rooms and engaged in five minutes of painfully formal small talk while I refilled the flit\u2019s feeders with the still-warm medicine. The birds were unnervingly energetic, humming and chirruping sweetly.\nThe Maer sipped a cup of tea as we talked, his eyes following me quietly from the bed. When my work with the birds was finished I made my good- byes and left as quickly as propriety allowed.\nThough our conversation hadn\u2019t touched on anything more serious than the weather, I could read his underlying message as plainly as if he\u2019d written it for me to read. He was in control. He was keeping his options open. He didn\u2019t trust me.\n \n"], "CHAPTER SIXTY-THREE": ["CHAPTER SIXTY-THREE\nThe Gilded Cage\nAFTER MY BRIEF TASTE of freedom, I was trapped in my rooms again. Though I hoped the Maer was through the worst of his recovery, I still needed to be at hand should his condition worsen and he call on me. I couldn\u2019t justify even a brief trip to Severen-Low, no matter how desperately I wanted to head back to Tinnery Street with the hope of meeting up with Denna.\nSo I called on Bredon and spent a pleasant afternoon playing tak. We played game after game, and I lost each one in new and exciting ways. This time when we parted ways, he left the game table with me, claiming his servants were tired of carrying it back and forth between our rooms.\nIn addition to tak with Bredon and my music, I had a new distraction, albeit an irritating one. Caudicus was every bit the gossip he seemed to be, and word had spread about my story genealogy. So now in addition to courtiers trying to pry information out of me, I was deluged with a steady flow of people eager to air everyone else\u2019s dirty laundry.\nI dissuaded those I could, and encouraged the especially rabid to write their stories down and send them to me. A surprising number of them took time to do this, and a stack of slanderous stories began to accumulate on a desk in one of my unused rooms.\nThe next day when the Maer summoned me, I arrived to find Alveron sitting in a chair near his bed, reading a copy of Fyoren\u2019s Claim of Kings in the original Eld Vintic. His color was remarkably good and I saw no trembling in his hands as he turned a page. He didn\u2019t look up as I entered the room.\nWithout speaking, I prepared a new pot of tea with the hot water waiting at the Maer\u2019s bedside table. I poured a cup and set it at the table by his elbow.\n \nI checked the gilded cage in his sitting room. The flits darted back and forth to the feeders, playing dizzying aerial games which made them difficult to count. Still, I was reasonably certain there were twelve of them. They seemed none the worse despite three days of poisonous diet. I resisted an urge to knock the cage about a bit.\nFinally I replaced the Maer\u2019s flask of cod liver oil and found it was still three-quarters full. Yet another sign of my fading credibility.\nWordlessly I gathered up my things and prepared to leave, but before I made it to the door, the Maer turned his eyes up from his book. \u201cKvothe?\u201d\n\u201cYes, your grace?\u201d\n\u201cIt seems I am not as thirsty as I thought. Would you mind finishing this for me?\u201d He gestured to the untasted cup of tea that sat on the table.\n\u201cTo your grace\u2019s health,\u201d I said, and drank a sip. I made a face and added a spoon of sugar, stirred, and drained the rest of it with the Maer watching me. His eyes were calm, clever, and too knowing to be wholly good.\nCaudicus let me in and ushered me into the same seat as before. \u201cYou\u2019ll excuse me for a moment,\u201d he said. \u201cI have an experiment I must attend to, or I fear it will be ruined.\u201d He hurried up a set of steps that led to a different part of the tower.\nWith nothing else to occupy my attention, I eyed his display of rings again, realizing that a person could make a fair guess at his position in the court by using the rings themselves as triangulation points.\nCaudicus returned just as I was idly considering stealing one of his gold rings.\n\u201cI was not sure if you wanted your rings back,\u201d Caudicus said, gesturing.\nI looked back at the table and saw them resting on a tray. It seemed odd I hadn\u2019t noticed them before. I picked them up and slid them into an inner pocket of my cloak. \u201cThank you kindly,\u201d I said.\n\u201cAnd will you be taking the Maer his medicine again today?\u201d he asked.\nI nodded, puffing myself up proudly.\nWhen I nodded, the motion of my head made me dizzy. It was only then I\nrealized the trouble: I\u2019d drunk a full cup of the Maer\u2019s tea. There hadn\u2019t been much laudanum in it. Or rather, not much laudanum if you were in pain and\n \nbeing slowly weaned away from a budding addiction to ophalum. However, it was quite a bit of laudanum for someone like myself. I could\nfeel the effects of it slowly creeping over me, a warm lassitude running through my bones. Everything seemed to be moving a little more slowly than normal.\n\u201cThe Maer seemed eager for his medicine today,\u201d I said, taking extra care to speak clearly. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have much time to chat.\u201d I was in no condition to play the half-wit gentry for any length of time.\nCaudicus nodded seriously and retreated to his worktable. I followed him as I always did, wearing my best curious expression.\nI watched with half an eye as Caudicus mixed the medicine. But my wits were fuddled by the laudanum, and what remained were focused on other matters. The Maer was hardly speaking to me. Stapes hadn\u2019t trusted me from the beginning, and the flits were healthy as ever. Worst of all, I was trapped in my rooms while Denna waited down on Tinnery Street, no doubt wondering why I hadn\u2019t come to visit.\nI looked up, aware that Caudicus had asked me a question. \u201cBeg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cCould you pass me the acid?\u201d Caudicus repeated as he finished measuring out a portion of leaf into his mortar and pestle.\nI picked up the glass decanter and began to hand it to him before I remembered I was just an ignorant lordling. I couldn\u2019t tell salt from sulfur. I didn\u2019t even know what an acid was.\nI did not flush or stumble. I didn\u2019t sweat or stutter. I am Edema Ruh born, and even drugged and fuddled I am a performer down to the marrow of my bones. I met his eyes and asked, \u201cThis one, right? The clear bottle comes next.\u201d\nCaudicus gave me a long, speculative look.\nI flashed him a brilliant grin. \u201cI\u2019ve got a good eye for detail,\u201d I said smugly. \u201cI\u2019ve watched you go through this twice now. I bet I could mix the Maer\u2019s medicine myself if I wanted to.\u201d\nI pitched my voice with all the ignorant self-confidence I could muster. This is the true mark of nobility. The unshakable belief that they can do anything: tan leather, shoe a horse, spin pottery, plow a field . . . if they really wanted to.\nCaudicus looked at me a moment longer, then began to measure out the acid. \u201cI daresay you could, young sir.\u201d", "Three minutes later I was walking down the hall with the warm vial of medicine in my sweaty palm. It almost didn\u2019t matter whether I\u2019d fooled him or not. What mattered was that for some reason, Caudicus was suspicious of me.\nStapes stared daggers into my back as he let me into the Maer\u2019s rooms, and Alveron ignored me as I poured the new dose of poison into the flit\u2019s feeders. The pretty things hummed about their cage with infuriating energy.\nI took the long way back to my rooms, trying to get a better feel for the layout of the Maer\u2019s estate. I already had my escape route half planned, but Caudicus\u2019 suspicion encouraged me to put the finishing touches on it. If the flits didn\u2019t start dying tomorrow, it would probably be in my best interest to disappear from Severen as quickly and quietly as possible.\nLate that night, when I was reasonably sure the Maer wouldn\u2019t call on me, I slipped out the window of my room and made a thorough exploration of the gardens. There were no guards this late at night, but I did have to avoid a half-dozen couples taking moonlight strolls. There were two others sitting in close, romantic conversation, one in a bower, the other in a gazebo. The last couple I nearly trod on while cutting through a hedgerow. They were neither strolling nor conversing in any conventional sense, but their activities were romantic. They didn\u2019t notice me.\nEventually I found my way onto the roof. From there I could see the grounds surrounding the estate. The western edge was out of the question, of course, as it was pressed up against the edge of the Sheer, but I knew there had to be other opportunities for escape.\nWhile exploring the southern end of the estate, I saw lights burning brightly in one of the towers. What\u2019s more, they had the distinctive, red tint of sympathy lamps. Caudicus was still awake.\nI made my way over and risked a look inside, peering down into the tower. Caudicus was not simply working late. He was talking to someone. I craned my neck, but I couldn\u2019t see who he was speaking to. What\u2019s more, the window was leaded shut and I couldn\u2019t hear anything.\nI was about to move to a different window when Caudicus stood and began to walk to the door. The other person came into view, and even from this\n \nsteep angle I could recognize the portly, unassuming figure of Stapes. Stapes was clearly worked up about something. He made an emphatic\ngesture with one hand, his face deathly serious. Caudicus nodded several times in agreement before opening the door to let the manservant out.\nI noted Stapes wasn\u2019t carrying anything when he left. He hadn\u2019t stopped by for medicine. He hadn\u2019t stopped by to borrow a book. Stapes had stopped by in the middle of the night to have a private conversation with the man who was trying to kill the Maer.", ""], "CHAPTER SIXTY-FOUR": ["CHAPTER SIXTY-FOUR\nFlight\nThough no family can boast a truly peaceful past, the Lacklesses have been especially ripe with misfortune. Some from without: assassination, invasion, peasant revolt, and theft. More telling is misfortune that comes from within: how can a family thrive when the eldest heir forsakes all family duty? Small wonder they are often called the \u201cLuckless\u201d by their detractors.\nIt seems a testament to the strength of their blood that they have survived so much for so long. Indeed, if not for the burning of Caluptena, we might possess records tracing the Lackless family back far enough for them to rival the royal line of Modeg in its antiquity. . . .\nI tossed the book onto the table in a way that would have made Master Lorren spit blood. If the Maer thought this sort of information was enough to woo a woman, he was in worse need of my help than he thought.\nBut as things currently stood, I doubted the Maer would be asking me for any help with anything, least of all something as sensitive as his courting. Yesterday he hadn\u2019t summoned me to his rooms at all.\nI was clearly out of favor, and I sensed Stapes had a hand in it. Given what I had seen two nights ago in Caudicus\u2019 tower, it was fairly obvious Stapes was part of the conspiracy to poison the Maer.\nThough it meant spending all day trapped in my rooms, I stayed where I was. I knew better than to jeopardize Alveron\u2019s already low opinion of me by approaching him without being summoned first.\nAn hour before lunch Viscount Guermen stopped by my rooms with a few pages of handwritten gossip. He also brought a deck of cards, apparently thinking to take a page from Bredon\u2019s book. He offered to teach me how to play thrush, and, as I was just learning the game, agreed to play for the pittance of a single silver bit per hand.", "He made the mistake of letting me deal, and left in a bit of huff after I won eighteen hands in a row. I suppose I could have been more subtle. I could have played him like a fish on a line and bilked him for half his estate, but I was in no mood for it. My thoughts were not pleasant, and I preferred to be alone with them.\nAn hour after lunch, I decided I was no longer interested in currying favor with the Maer. If Alveron wished to trust his treacherous manservant, that was his business. I\u2019d be damned if I would spend one more minute sitting idle in my room, waiting by the door like a whipped dog.\nI threw on my cloak, grabbed my lute case, and decided to take a walk down Tinnery Street. If the Maer needed me while I was away, he could damn well leave a note.\nI was halfway into the hall when I saw the guard standing at attention outside my door. He was one of Alveron\u2019s own, clad in sapphire and ivory.\nWe stood for a moment, motionless. There was no sense in asking if he was there on my account. Mine was the only door for twenty feet in any direction. I met his eye. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d\n\u201cJayes, sir.\u201d\nAt least I still rated a \u201csir.\u201d That was worth something. \u201cAnd you\u2019re here because . . .?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m to accompany you if you leave your room. Sir.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d I stepped back into my room and closed the door behind me. Were his orders from Alveron or Stapes? It didn\u2019t really matter.\nI went out my window, into the garden, over the little streamlet, behind a\nhedgerow, and up a section of decorative stone wall. My burgundy cloak was not the best color for sneaking around in the garden, but it worked quite nicely against the red of the roofing tiles.\nAfter that I made my way onto the roof of the stables, through a hayloft, and out the back door of a disused barn. From there it was just a matter of jumping a fence and I was off the Maer\u2019s estate. Simple.\nI stopped at twelve inns on Tinnery Street before I found the one where Denna was staying. She wasn\u2019t there, so I continued along the street, keeping my eyes open and trusting to my luck.\n \nI spotted her an hour later. She was standing at the edge of a crowd, watching a street corner a production of, believe it or not, Three Pennies for Wishing.\nHer skin was darker than when I\u2019d seen her last at the University, tanned from travel, and she wore a high-necked dress after the local fashion. Her dark hair fell in a straight sheaf across her back, all except a single slender braid that hung close to her face.\nI caught her eye just as Deadnettle shouted out his first line in the play:\nI\u2019ve cures for what ails you!\nMy wares never fails you!\nI\u2019ve potions for pennies, results guaranteed! So if you\u2019ve got a dicky heart,\nOr can\u2019t get her legs apart,\nCome straightaway to my cart,\nYou\u2019ll find what you need!\nDenna smiled when she saw me. We might have stayed for the play, but I already knew the ending.\nHours later, Denna and I were eating sweet Vintish grapes in the shadow of the Sheer. Some industrious stonemason had carved a shallow niche into the white stone of the cliff, making smooth seats of stone. It was a cozy place we had discovered while walking aimlessly through the city. We were alone, and I felt myself to be the luckiest man in the world.\nMy only regret was that I didn\u2019t have her ring with me. It would have been the perfect unexpected gift to go with our unexpected meeting. Worse yet, I couldn\u2019t even tell Denna about it. If I did, I\u2019d be forced to admit I\u2019d used it as collateral for my loan with Devi.\n\u201cYou seem to be doing fairly well for yourself,\u201d Denna said, rubbing the edge of my burgundy cloak between her fingers. \u201cHave you given up the bookish life?\u201d\n\u201cTaking a vacation,\u201d I hedged. \u201cRight now I\u2019m assisting the Maer Alveron with a thing or two.\u201d\n \nHer eyes widened appreciatively. \u201cDo tell.\u201d\nI looked away uncomfortably. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t. Delicate matters and all that.\u201d I cleared my throat and tried to change the subject. \u201cWhat of you? You seem to be doing fairly well yourself.\u201d I brushed two fingers across the embroidery that decorated the high neck of her dress.\n\u201cWell I\u2019m not rubbing elbows with the Maer,\u201d she said, making an exaggerated deferential gesture in my direction. \u201cBut as I mentioned in my letters, I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLetters?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou sent more than one?\u201d\nShe nodded. \u201cThree since I left,\u201d she said. \u201cI was about to start a fourth, but you\u2019ve saved me the trouble.\u201d\n\u201cI only got the one,\u201d I said.\nDenna shrugged. \u201cI\u2019d rather tell you in person, anyway.\u201d She paused dramatically. \u201cI finally have my formal patronage.\u201d\n\u201cYou have?\u201d I said, delighted. \u201cDenna, that\u2019s wonderful news!\u201d\nDenna grinned proudly. Her teeth were white against the light nut color of her travel-tanned face. Her lips, as always, were red without the aid of any paint.\n\u201cIs he part of the court here in Severen?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d\nDenna\u2019s grin faded into a serious look, a confused smile playing around her mouth. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t tell you that,\u201d she chided. \u201cYou know how closely he guards his privacy.\u201d\nMy excitement fell away, leaving me cold. \u201cOh no. Denna. It\u2019s not the same fellow as before, is it? The one who sent you to play for that wedding in Trebon?\u201d\nDenna looked puzzled. \u201cOf course it is. I can\u2019t tell you his real name. What was it you called him before? Master Elm?\u201d\n\u201cMaster Ash,\u201d I said, and it felt like a mouthful of ashes when I said it. \u201cDo you at least know his real name? Did he tell you that much before you signed up?\u201d\n\u201cI expect I know his real name,\u201d she shrugged, running a hand through her hair. When her fingers touched the braid she seemed surprised to find it there and quickly began to unravel it, her deft fingers smoothing it away. \u201cEven if I don\u2019t, what does it matter? Everyone has secrets, Kvothe. I don\u2019t particularly care what his are so long as he continues to deal square with me. He\u2019s been very generous.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not just secretive, Denna,\u201d I protested. \u201cFrom the way you\u2019ve", "described him, I\u2019d say he\u2019s either paranoid or tangled up in dangerous business.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re carrying such a grudge against him.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t believe she could say that. \u201cDenna, he beat you senseless.\u201d\nShe went very still. \u201cNo.\u201d Her hand went to the fading bruise on her cheek.\n\u201cNo he didn\u2019t. I told you. I fell while I was out riding. The stupid horse couldn\u2019t tell a stick from a snake.\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cI\u2019m talking about last fall in Trebon.\u201d\nDenna\u2019s hand fell back to her lap where it made an absentminded fidgeting gesture, trying to toy with a ring that wasn\u2019t there. She looked at me, her expression blank. \u201cHow did you know about that?\u201d\n\u201cYou told me yourself. That night on the hill, waiting for the draccus to come.\u201d\nShe looked down, blinking. \u201cI . . . I don\u2019t remember saying that.\u201d\n\u201cYou were a little addled at the time,\u201d I said gently. \u201cBut you did. You told me all about it. Denna, you shouldn\u2019t have to stay with someone like that. Anyone who could do that to you . . .\u201d\n\u201cHe did it for my own good,\u201d she said, her dark eyes beginning to flicker with anger. \u201cDid I tell you that? There I was without a scratch on me and everyone else at the wedding dead as leather. You know what small towns are like. Even after they found me unconscious they thought I might have had something to do with it. You remember.\u201d\nI put my head down and shook it like an ox worrying its yoke. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it. There had to be another way around the situation. I would have found another way.\u201d\n\u201cWell I guess we can\u2019t all be as clever as you,\u201d she said.\n\u201cClever doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it!\u201d I came close to shouting. \u201cHe could have taken you away with him! He could have come forward and vouched for you!\u201d\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t let anyone know he was there,\u201d Denna said. \u201cHe said\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe beat you.\u201d And as I spoke the words I felt a terrible anger come together inside me. It wasn\u2019t hot and furious, as some of my flashes of temper tend to be. This was different, slow and cold. And as soon as I felt it, I realized it had been there inside me for a long while, crystallizing, like a pond slowly freezing solid over a long winter night.\n\u201cHe beat you,\u201d I said again, and I could feel it inside, a solid block of icy anger. \u201cNothing you can say will change that. And if I ever see him, I\u2019ll", "likely stick a knife in him rather than shake his hand.\u201d\nDenna looked up at me then, the irritation fading from her face. She gave\nme a look that was all sweet fondness and mingled pity. It was the sort of look you give a puppy when it growls, thinking itself terribly fierce. She put her hand gently on the side of my face, and I felt myself flush hot and hard, suddenly embarrassed by my own melodrama.\n\u201cCan we not argue about it?\u201d she asked. \u201cPlease? Not today? It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve seen you. . . .\u201d\nI decided to let it go rather than risk driving her away. I knew what happened when men pressed her too hard. \u201cFair enough,\u201d I said. \u201cFor today. Can you at least tell me what sort of thing your patron brought you out here for?\u201d\nDenna leaned back in her seat, smiling a wide smile. \u201cSorry, delicate matters and all that,\u201d she mimicked.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be that way,\u201d I protested. \u201cI\u2019d tell you if I could, but the Maer values his privacy very highly.\u201d\nDenna leaned forward again to lay her hand over mine. \u201cPoor Kvothe, it\u2019s not out of spite. My patron is at least as private as the Maer. He made it very clear that things would go badly if I ever made our relationship public. He was quite emphatic about it.\u201d Her expression had gone serious. \u201cHe\u2019s a powerful man.\u201d She seemed as if she would say more, then stopped herself.\nThough I didn\u2019t want to, I understood. My recent brush with the Maer\u2019s anger had taught me caution. \u201cWhat can you tell me about him?\u201d\nDenna tapped a finger against her lips thoughtfully. \u201cHe\u2019s a surprisingly good dancer. I think I can say that without betraying anything. He\u2019s quite graceful,\u201d she said, then laughed at my expression. \u201cI\u2019m doing some research for him, looking into old genealogies and histories. He\u2019s helping me write a couple songs so I can make a name for myself. . . .\u201d She hesitated, then shook her head. \u201cI think that\u2019s all I can say.\u201d\n\u201cWill I get to hear the songs after you\u2019re done?\u201d\nShe gave a shy smile. \u201cI think that can be arranged.\u201d She leapt to her feet and grabbed my arm to pull me to my feet. \u201cEnough talking. Come and walk with me!\u201d\nI smiled, her enthusiasm as infectious as a child\u2019s. But when she pulled at my hand, she let out a tiny yelp, flinching and pressing one of her hands to her side.\nI was standing next to her in a second. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d", "Denna shrugged and gave me a brittle smile, holding her arm close to her ribs. \u201cMy fall,\u201d she said. \u201cThat stupid horse. I get a twinge when I forget and move too quickly.\u201d\n\u201cHas anyone looked at it?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a bruise,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the sort of doctor I can afford, I wouldn\u2019t trust to touch me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat of your patron?\u201d I asked. \u201cCertainly he could arrange something.\u201d\nShe slowly straightened. \u201cIt\u2019s really not a problem.\u201d She lifted her arms above her head and made a quick, clever dance step, then laughed at my serious expression. \u201cNo more talk of secret things for now. Come walk with me. Tell me dark and lurid gossip from the Maer\u2019s court.\u201d\n\u201cVery well,\u201d I said as we began to walk. \u201cI\u2019ve heard the Maer is marvelously recovered from a long-standing illness.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a poor rumormonger,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone knows that.\u201d\n\u201cThe Baronet Bramston played a disastrous deck of faro last night.\u201d\nDenna rolled her eyes. \u201cBoring.\u201d\n\u201cThe Comptess DeFerre lost her virginity while attending a performance of\nDaeonica.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Denna raised her hand to her mouth, stifling a laugh. \u201cDid she\nreally?\u201d\n\u201cShe certainly didn\u2019t have it with her after the intermission,\u201d I said in a\nhushed voice. \u201cBut it turns out she had just left it behind in her rooms. So it was merely misplaced, not really lost. The servants found it two days later when they were cleaning up. Turns out, it had rolled underneath a chest of drawers.\u201d\nDenna\u2019s expression turned indignant. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I believed you!\u201d She swatted at me, then grimaced again, sucking a sharp breath through her teeth.\n\u201cYou know,\u201d I said softly. \u201cI\u2019ve been trained at the University. I\u2019m not a physicker, but the medicine I know is good. I could take a look at it for you.\u201d She gave me a long look, as if she wasn\u2019t quite sure what to make of my\noffer. \u201cI think,\u201d she said at last, \u201cthat might be the most circumspect route anyone has ever tried for getting me out of my clothes.\u201d\n\u201cI . . .\u201d I felt myself blush furiously. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean . . .\u201d\nDenna laughed at my discomfiture. \u201cIf I let anyone play doctor with me, it would be you, my Kvothe,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll tend to it for now.\u201d She linked arms with me and we continued our walk down the street. \u201cI know enough to take care of myself.\u201d", " I returned to the Maer\u2019s estate hours later, taking the direct route rather than come in over the rooftops. When I arrived in the hallway leading to my room, I found two guards standing there instead of the single one that had been waiting before. I guessed they had discovered my escape.\nEven this couldn\u2019t dampen my spirits overmuch, as the time I\u2019d spent with Denna had left me feeling twelve feet tall. Better yet, I was meeting with her tomorrow to go riding. Having a specific time and place to meet was an unexpected treat where Denna was concerned.\n\u201cGood evening, gentlemen,\u201d I said as I came down the hall. \u201cAnything interesting happen while I was out?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re to be confined to your rooms,\u201d Jayes said grimly. I noticed he left off the \u201csir\u201d this time.\nI paused with my hand on the doorknob. \u201cBeg pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re to remain in your rooms until we get further orders,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd one of us is to stay with you at all times.\u201d\nI felt my temper flare up. \u201cAnd does Alveron know about this?\u201d I asked sharply.\nThey looked at each other uncertainly.\nIt was Stapes giving the orders then. That uncertainty would be enough to keep them from laying hands on me. \u201cLet\u2019s get this sorted out straightaway,\u201d I said, and started down the hall at a brisk walk, leaving the guards to catch up with me, their armor clattering.\nMy temper fanned itself hotter as I made my way through the halls. If my credibility with the Maer was truly ruined, I preferred to have done with it now. If I couldn\u2019t have the Maer\u2019s good will, I would at least have my freedom and the ability to see Denna when I wished.\nI turned the corner just in time to see the Maer emerging from his rooms. He looked as healthy as I had ever seen him, carrying a sheaf of papers under one arm.\nAs I approached, irritation flashed across his face and I thought he might simply have the guards carry me away. Nevertheless, I approached him as boldly as if I had a written invitation. \u201cYour grace,\u201d I said with cheery cordiality. \u201cMight we talk for a moment?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d he replied in a similar tone as he swung open the door he had been about to close behind himself. \u201cDo come in.\u201d I watched his eyes and", "saw an anger as hot as mine. A small, sensible part of me quailed, but my temper had the bit in its teeth and was galloping madly ahead.\nWe left the bemused guards in the antechamber, and Alveron led me through the second set of doors into his personal rooms. Silence hung dangerous in the air, like the calm before a sudden summer storm.\n\u201cI cannot believe your impudence,\u201d the Maer hissed once the doors were closed. \u201cYour wild accusations. Your ridiculous claims. I mislike public unpleasantness so we will deal with this later.\u201d He made an imperious gesture. \u201cReturn to your rooms and do not leave until I decide how best to deal with you.\u201d\n\u201cYour grace\u2014\u201d\nI could tell by the set of his shoulders that he was ready to call the guards. \u201cI do not hear you,\u201d he said flatly.\nHe met my gaze then. His eyes were hard as flint and I saw how angry he truly was. This wasn\u2019t the anger of a patron or employer. It wasn\u2019t someone irritated by my failure to respect the social order. This was a man who had ruled everything around him from the age of sixteen. This man thought nothing of hanging someone from an iron gibbet to make a point. This was a man who, but for a twist of history, would now be king of all Vintas.\nMy temper sputtered and went out like a snuffed candle, leaving me chilled. I realized then that I had misjudged my situation badly.\nWhen I was a child, homeless on the streets of Tarbean, I\u2019d learned to deal with dangerous people: drunken dockworkers, guardsmen, even a homeless child with a bottle-glass knife can kill you.\nThe key to staying safe was knowing the rules of the situation. A guard wouldn\u2019t beat you in the middle of the street. A dockworker wouldn\u2019t chase you if you ran.\nNow, with sudden clarity, I realized my mistake. The Maer was not bound by any rules. He could order me killed then hang my body over the city gates. He could throw me in jail and forget about me. He could leave me there while I grew starved and sickly. I had no position, no friends to intercede on my behalf. I was helpless as a child with a willow-switch sword.\nI realized this in a flash and felt a gnawing fear settle in my belly. I should have stayed in Severen-Low while I had the chance. I never should have come here in the first place and meddled in the affairs of powerful folk such as this.\nIt was just then that Stapes bustled in from the Maer\u2019s dressing room.", "Seeing us, his normally placid expression flickered briefly into panic and surprise. He recovered quickly. \u201cI beg your pardon, sirs,\u201d he said, and hurried back the way he came.\n\u201cStapes,\u201d the Maer called out before he could leave. \u201cCome here.\u201d\nStapes slunk back into the room. He wrung his hands nervously. His face had the stricken look of a guilty man, a man caught in the midst of something dishonest.\nAlveron\u2019s voice was stern. \u201cStapes, what do you have there?\u201d Looking closer, I saw the manservant wasn\u2019t wringing his hands, he was clutching something.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing\u2014\u201d\n\u201cStapes!\u201d the Maer barked. \u201cHow dare you lie to me! Show me at once!\u201d Numbly, the portly manservant opened his hands. A tiny gem-bright bird\nlay lifeless on his palm. His face had lost all hint of color.\nNever in the history of the world has the death of a lovely thing brought\nsuch relief and joy. I had been certain of Stapes\u2019 betrayal for days now, and here was the unquestionable proof of it.\nNevertheless, I kept quiet. The Maer had to see this with his own eyes. \u201cWhat is the meaning of this?\u201d the Maer asked slowly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good to think of such things, sir,\u201d the manservant said quickly,\n\u201cand worse to dwell on them. I\u2019ll just fetch another one. It\u2019ll sing just as sweet.\u201d\nThere was a long pause. I could see Alveron struggling to contain the rage he\u2019d been ready to unleash on me. The silence continued to stretch.\n\u201cStapes,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cHow many birds have you replaced these last few days?\u201d\nStapes turned to me, his expression indignant.\nBefore he could speak, the Maer broke in. \u201cAnswer him, Stapes.\u201d His voice sounded almost choked. \u201cHas there been more than this one?\u201d\nStapes gave the Maer a stricken look. \u201cOh Rand, I didn\u2019t want to trouble you. You were so bad for a time. Then you asked for the birds and had that terrible night. Then the next day one of them died.\u201d\nLooking down at the tiny bird in his hand, his words came faster and faster, almost tumbling over each other. Too clumsy to be anything but sincere. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to fill your head with talk of dying things. So I snuck it out and brought a new one in. Then you kept getting better and they started falling four or five a day. Every time I looked there would be another one", "lying in the bottom of the cage like a little cut flower. But you were doing so well. I didn\u2019t want to mention it.\u201d\nStapes covered the dead sipquick with a cupped hand. \u201cIt\u2019s like they were giving up their little souls to make you well again.\u201d Something inside the man suddenly gave way, and he began to cry. The deep, hopeless sobs of an honest man who has been frightened and helpless for a long time, watching the slow death of a well-loved friend.\nAlveron stood motionless for a stunned moment, all the anger spilling out of him. Then he moved to put his arms gently around his manservant. \u201cOh Stapes,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThey were, in a way. You haven\u2019t done anything you can be blamed for.\u201d\nI quietly left the room and busied myself removing the feeders from the gilded cage.\nAn hour later the three of us were eating a quiet supper together in the Maer\u2019s rooms. Alveron and I told Stapes what had been happening over the last several days. Stapes was almost giddy, both at his master\u2019s health and at the knowledge it would continue to improve.\nAs for myself, after suffering a few days under Alveron\u2019s displeasure, being so suddenly in his good graces again was a relief. Nevertheless, I was shaken by how close to disaster I had been.\nI was honest with the Maer about my misguided suspicion of Stapes, and I offered the manservant my sincere apology. Stapes in turn admitted his doubts about me. In the end we shook hands and thought much better of each other.\nAs we were chatting over the last bites of supper Stapes perked up, excused himself, and hurried out.\n\u201cMy outer door,\u201d the Maer explained. \u201cHe has ears like a dog. It\u2019s uncanny.\u201d\nStapes opened the door to admit the tall man with the shaven head who had been looking over maps with Alveron when I\u2019d first arrived, Commander Dagon.\nAs Dagon stepped into the room his eyes flicked to each of the corners, to the window, to the other door, briefly over me, then back to the Maer. When\n \nhis eyes touched me, all the deep feral instincts that had kept me alive on the streets of Tarbean told me to run. Hide. Do anything so long as it took me far away from this man.\n\u201cAh, Dagon!\u201d the Maer said cheerily. \u201cAre you well this fine day?\u201d\n\u201cYes, your grace.\u201d He stood attentively, not quite meeting the Maer\u2019s eye. \u201cWould you be good enough to arrest Caudicus for treason?\u201d\nThere was a half-heartbeat pause. \u201cYes, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cEight men should be sufficient, providing they\u2019re not likely to panic in a\ncomplicated situation.\u201d\n\u201cYes, your grace.\u201d I began to sense subtle differences in Dagon\u2019s\nresponses.\n\u201cAlive,\u201d Alveron responded, as if answering a question. \u201cBut you needn\u2019t\nbe gentle.\u201d\n\u201cYes, your grace.\u201d With that, Dagon turned to leave.\nI spoke up quickly. \u201cYour grace, if he\u2019s truly an arcanist you ought to take\ncertain precautions.\u201d I regretted the word \u201cought\u201d as soon as I had said it, \u201cought\u201d was presumptuous. I should have said, You may wish to consider taking certain precautions.\nAlveron seemed to take no notice of my misstep. \u201cYes, of course. Set a thief to catch a thief. Dagon, before you settle him downstairs, bind him hand and foot with good iron chain. Pure iron, mind you. Gag and blindfold him. . . .\u201d He thought for a brief moment, tapping his lips with a finger \u201cAnd cut off his thumbs.\u201d\n\u201cYes, your grace.\u201d\nAlveron looked at me. \u201cDo you think that should be sufficient?\u201d\nI fought down a wave of nausea and forced myself not to wring my hands\nin my lap. I didn\u2019t know which I found more unsettling, the cheerful tone with which Alveron delivered the commands, or the flat emotionless one with which Dagon accepted them. A full arcanist was nothing to trifle with, but I found the thought of crippling the man\u2019s hands more horrifying than killing him outright.\nDagon left, and after the door closed Stapes shuddered. \u201cGood lord, Rand, he\u2019s like cold water down the back of my neck. I wish you\u2019d get rid of him.\u201d\nThe Maer laughed. \u201cSo someone else could have him? No, Stapes. I want him right here. My mad dog on a short leash.\u201d\nStapes frowned. But before he could make anything more of it, his eyes were drawn through the doorway into the sitting room. \u201cOh, there\u2019s another", "one.\u201d He walked to the cage and returned with another dead flit, holding its tiny body tenderly as he carried it out of the chambers. \u201cI know you needed to test the medicine on something,\u201d he said from the other room. \u201cBut it\u2019s a little rough on the poor little calanthis.\u201d\n\u201cBeg pardon?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cOur Stapes is old-fashioned,\u201d Alveron explained with a smile. \u201cAnd more educated than he cares to admit. Calanthis is the Eld Vintic name for them.\u201d\n\u201cI could swear I\u2019ve heard that word somewhere else.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s also the surname of the royal line of Vintas,\u201d Alveron said chidingly. \u201cFor someone who knows so much, you\u2019re curiously blind in places.\u201d\nStapes craned his neck to look toward the cage again. \u201cI know you had to do it,\u201d he said, \u201cBut why not use mice, or Comptess DeFerre\u2019s nasty little dog?\u201d\nBefore I could answer, there was a thump from the outer rooms and a guard burst through the inner door before Stapes could come to his feet.\n\u201cYour grace,\u201d the man said breathlessly as he jumped to the room\u2019s only window and slammed the shutters. Next he ran to the sitting room and did the same with the window in there. There followed other, similar noises from rooms farther back I had never seen. There was a faint sound of furniture being moved.\nStapes looked puzzled and half rose to his feet, but the Maer shook his head and motioned for him to sit down. \u201cLieutenant?\u201d he called out, a tinge of irritation in his voice.\n\u201cBeg pardon, your grace,\u201d the guard said as he reentered the room, breathing heavily. \u201cDagon\u2019s orders. I was to secure your rooms straightaway.\u201d\n\u201cI take it all is not well,\u201d Alveron said dryly.\n\u201cThere was no answer from the tower when we knocked. Dagon had us force the door. There was . . . I know not what it was, your grace. Some malignant spirit. Anders is dead, your grace. Caudicus is nowhere in his rooms, but Dagon is after him.\u201d\nAlveron\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cDamn!\u201d he thundered, striking the arm of his chair with a fist. His brow furrowed and he let out an explosive sigh. \u201cVery well.\u201d He waved the guard away.\nThe guard stood stiffly. \u201cSir. Dagon said I\u2019m not to leave you unguarded.\u201d\nAlveron gave him a dangerous look. \u201cVery well, but stand over there.\u201d He pointed to the corner of the room.", "The guard appeared perfectly happy to fade into the background. Alveron leaned forward, pressing the tips of his fingers to his forehead. \u201cHow in the name of God did he suspect?\u201d\nThe question seemed rhetorical, but it set the wheels of my mind spinning. \u201cDid your grace pick up his medicine yesterday?\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes. I did everything the same as I had done in days past.\u201d\nExcept you didn\u2019t send me to get your medicine, I thought to myself. \u201cDo you still have the vial?\u201d I asked.\nHe did. Stapes brought it to me. I uncorked it and ran a finger along the inside of the glass. \u201cHow does your grace\u2019s medicine taste?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve told you. Brackish, bitter.\u201d I watched the Maer\u2019s eyes go wide as I brought my finger to my mouth and touched it lightly to the tip of my tongue. \u201cAre you mad?\u201d Alveron said incredulously.\n\u201cSweet,\u201d I said simply. Then I rinsed my mouth with water and spat it as delicately as possible into an empty glass. I took a small folded packet of paper from a pocket in my vest, shook a small amount into my hand and ate it, grimacing.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Stapes asked.\n\u201cLiguellen,\u201d I lied, knowing the real answer, charcoal, would only provoke more questions. I took a mouthful of water and spat it out as well. This time it was black, and Alveron and Stapes stared at it, startled.\nI bulled ahead. \u201cSomething must have made him suspect you were not taking your medicine, your grace. If it suddenly tasted different, you would have asked him.\u201d\nThe Maer nodded. \u201cI saw him yesterday evening. He asked after my health.\u201d He beat his fist softly onto the arm of his chair. \u201cAll the cursed luck. If he has any wit, he\u2019s been gone half a day. We\u2019ll never catch him.\u201d\nI thought about reminding him that if he had believed me from the first, none of this would have happened, then thought better of it. \u201cI\u2019d advise your men to stay out of his tower, your grace. He\u2019s had time to prepare a great deal of mischief in there, traps and the like.\u201d\nThe Maer nodded and passed his hand in front of his eyes. \u201cYes. Of course. See to it, Stapes. I believe I\u2019ll take a bit of rest. This business may take a while to sort out.\u201d\nI gathered myself to leave. But the Maer gestured me back into my seat. \u201cKvothe, stay a moment and make me a pot of tea before you go.\u201d\nStapes rang for servants. While clearing the remains of our lunch away,", "they glanced at me curiously. Not only sitting in the Maer\u2019s presence, I was sharing a meal with him in his private chambers. This news would be rumored through the estate in under ten minutes.\nAfter the servants left, I made the Maer another pot of tea. I was preparing to leave when he spoke over the top of his cup, too softly for the guard to overhear.\n\u201cKvothe, you have proved perfectly trustworthy and I regret any doubts I briefly entertained about you.\u201d He sipped and swallowed before continuing. \u201cUnfortunately, I cannot allow news of a poisoning to spread. Especially with the poisoner escaped.\u201d He gave me a significant look. \u201cIt would interfere with the matter we discussed before.\u201d\nI nodded. Widespread knowledge that his own arcanist had nearly killed him would hardly help Alveron win the hand of the woman he hoped to marry.\nHe continued. \u201cUnfortunately this need for silence also precludes my giving you a reward you all too richly deserve. Were the situation different, I would consider the gift of lands mere token thanks. I would grant you title too. This power my family still retains, free from the controlment of the king.\u201d\nMy head reeled at the implication of what the Maer was saying as he continued. \u201cHowever, if I were to do such a thing, there would be need of explanation. And an explanation is the one thing I cannot afford.\u201d\nAlveron extended his hand, and it took me a moment to realize he intended me to shake it. One does not typically shake hands with the Maer Alveron. I immediately regretted that the only person present to see it was the guard. I hoped he was a gossip.\nI took his hand solemnly, and Alveron continued, \u201cI owe you a great debt. If you ever find yourself in need, you shall have at your command all the help a grateful lord can lend.\u201d\nI nodded graciously, trying to keep a calm demeanor despite my excitement. This was exactly what I had been hoping for. With the Maer\u2019s resources, I could make a concerted search for the Amyr. He could get me access to monastery archives, private libraries, places where important documents hadn\u2019t been pruned and edited as they had in the University.\nBut I knew this wasn\u2019t the proper time to ask. Alveron had promised his help. I could simply bide my time and choose what type of help I wanted most.", "As I stepped outside the Maer\u2019s rooms, Stapes surprised me with a sudden, wordless embrace. The expression on his face couldn\u2019t have been more grateful if I\u2019d pulled his family from a burning building. \u201cYoung sir, I doubt you understand how much I\u2019m in your debt. If there\u2019s anything you ever need, just make me wise of it.\u201d\nHe gripped my hand, pumping it up and down enthusiastically. At the same time I felt him press something into my palm.\nThen I was standing in the hallway. I opened my hand and saw a fine silver ring with Stapes\u2019 name etched across the face. Alongside it was a second ring that wasn\u2019t metal at all. It was smooth and white, and also had the manservant\u2019s name carved in rough letters across the surface of it. I had no idea what such a thing might signify.\nI made my way back to my rooms, almost dizzy with my sudden fortune.", ""], "CHAPTER SIXTY-FIVE": ["CHAPTER SIXTY-FIVE\nA Beautiful Game\nTHE NEXT DAY MY meager belongings were moved to rooms the Maer deemed more suitable for someone firmly in his favor. There were five of them in all, three with windows overlooking the garden.\nIt was a nice gesture, but I couldn\u2019t help but think that these rooms were even farther from the kitchens. My food would be cold as a stone by the time it made its way to me.\nI\u2019d barely been there an hour before a runner arrived bearing Bredon\u2019s silver ring and a card that read: \u201cYour glorious new rooms. When?\u201d\nI turned the card over, wrote: \u201cAs soon as you like,\u201d and sent the boy on his way.\nI placed his silver ring on a tray in my sitting room. The bowl next to it now had two silver rings glittering among the iron.\nI opened the door to see Bredon\u2019s dark eyes peering owlishly out at me from the halo of his white beard and hair. He smiled and bowed, his walking stick tucked under one arm. I offered him a seat, then excused myself politely and left him alone in the sitting room for a moment, as was the gracious thing to do.\nI was barely through the doorway before I heard his rich laugh coming from the other room, \u201cHo ho!\u201d he said. \u201cNow there\u2019s a thing!\u201d\nWhen I returned, Bredon was sitting by the tak board holding the two rings I had recently received from Stapes. \u201cThis is certainly a turn for the books,\u201d he said. \u201cApparently I misjudged things yesterday when my runner was turned away from your door by an altogether surly guard.\u201d\nI grinned at him. \u201cIt\u2019s been an exciting couple of days,\u201d I said.\nBredon tucked his chin and chuckled, looking even more owlish than usual. \u201cI daresay,\u201d he said, holding up the silver ring. \u201cThis tells quite a story. But this . . .\u201d He gestured to the white ring with his walking stick. \u201cThis is something else entirely. . . .\u201d\nI pulled up a seat across from him. \u201cI\u2019ll be frank with you,\u201d I said. \u201cI can", "only guess what it\u2019s made of, let alone what it signifies.\u201d\nBredon raised an eyebrow. \u201cThat\u2019s remarkably forthright of you.\u201d\nI shrugged. \u201cI feel somewhat more secure in my position here,\u201d I admitted.\n\u201cEnough that I can be a little less guarded with the people who have been kind to me.\u201d\nHe chuckled again as he lay the silver ring on the board. \u201cSecure,\u201d he said. \u201cI daresay you are at that.\u201d He picked up the white ring. \u201cStill, it\u2019s not odd that you wouldn\u2019t know about this.\u201d\n\u201cI thought there were just three types of rings,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s true for the most part,\u201d Bredon said. \u201cBut the giving of rings goes back quite a ways. The common folk were doing it long before it became a game for the gentry. And while Stapes may breathe the rarified air with the rest of us, his family is undeniably common.\u201d\nBredon set the white ring back onto the board and folded his hands over it. \u201cThose rings were made of things ordinary folk might find easily at hand. A young lover might give a ring of new green grass to someone he was courting. A ring of leather promises service. And so on.\u201d\n\u201cAnd a ring of horn?\u201d\n\u201cA ring of horn shows enmity,\u201d Bredon said. \u201cPowerful and lasting enmity.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d I said, somewhat taken aback. \u201cI see.\u201d\nBredon smiled and held the pale ring up to the light. \u201cBut this,\u201d he said, \u201cis not horn. The grain is wrong, and Stapes would never give a horn ring alongside a silver one.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNo. Unless I miss my guess, this is a ring of bone.\u201d He handed it to me.\n\u201cWonderful,\u201d I said glumly, turning it over in my hands. \u201cAnd that means what? That he\u2019ll stab me in the liver and push me down a dry well?\u201d\nBredon gave me his wide, warm smile. \u201cA ring of bone indicates a profound and lasting debt.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d I rubbed it between my fingers. \u201cI have to say I prefer being owed a favor.\u201d\n\u201cNot just a favor,\u201d Bredon said. \u201cTraditionally, a ring such as this is carved from the bone of a deceased family member.\u201d He raised an eyebrow. \u201cAnd while I doubt that is currently the case, it does get the point across.\u201d\nI looked up, still slightly dazed by it all. \u201cAnd that is. . . ?\u201d\n\u201cThat these things are not given lightly. It\u2019s not a part of games the gentry play, and not the sort of ring you should display.\u201d He gave me a look. \u201cIf I", "were you, I\u2019d tuck it safe away.\u201d\nI put it carefully into my pocket. \u201cYou\u2019ve been such help,\u201d I said. \u201cI wish I\ncould repay\u2014\u201d\nHe held up a hand, cutting me off midsentence. Then, moving with solemn\ncare, he pointed one finger downward, made a fist, and rapped a knuckle on the surface of the tak board.\nI smiled and brought out the stones.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m finally getting my teeth into the game,\u201d I said an hour later after losing by the narrowest of margins.\nBredon pushed his chair away from the table with an expression of distaste. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cQuite the opposite. You have the basics, but you\u2019re missing the whole point.\u201d\nI began to sort out the stones. \u201cThe point is that I\u2019m finally close to beating you after all this time.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bredon said. \u201cThat\u2019s not it at all. Tak is a subtle game. That\u2019s the reason I have such trouble finding people who can play it. Right now you are stomping about like a thug. If anything you\u2019re worse than you were two days ago.\u201d\n\u201cAdmit it,\u201d I said. \u201cI nearly had you that last time.\u201d\nHe merely scowled and pointed imperiously to the table.\nI set to it with a will, smiling and humming, sure that today I would finally\nbeat him.\nBut nothing could be further from the truth. Bredon set his stones\nruthlessly, not a breath of hesitation between his moves. He tore me apart as easily as you rip a sheet of paper in half.\nThe game was over so quickly it left me breathless.\n\u201cAgain,\u201d Bredon said, a note of command in his voice I\u2019d never heard before.\nI tried to rally, but the next game was worse. I felt like a puppy fighting a wolf. No. I was a mouse at the mercy of an owl. There was not even the pretence of a fight. All I could do was run.\nBut I couldn\u2019t run fast enough. This game was over sooner than the last. \u201cAgain,\u201d he demanded.\n \nAnd we played again. This time, I was not even a living thing. Bredon was calm and dispassionate as a butcher with a boning knife. The game lasted about the length of time it takes to gut and bone a chicken.\nAt the end of it Bredon frowned and shook his hands briskly to both sides of the board, as if he had just washed them and was trying to flick them dry.\n\u201cFine,\u201d I said, leaning back in my chair. \u201cI take your point. You\u2019ve been going easy on me.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bredon said with a grim look. \u201cThat is far gone from the point I am trying to make.\u201d\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d\n\u201cI am trying to make you understand the game,\u201d he said. \u201cThe entire game, not just the fiddling about with stones. The point is not to play as tight as you can. The point is to be bold. To be dangerous. Be elegant.\u201d\nHe tapped the board with two fingers. \u201cAny man that\u2019s half awake can spot a trap that\u2019s laid for him. But to stride in boldly with a plan to turn it on its ear, that is a marvelous thing.\u201d He smiled without any of the grimness leaving his face. \u201cTo set a trap and know someone will come in wary, ready with a trick of their own, then beat them. That is twice marvelous.\u201d\nBredon\u2019s expression softened, and his voice became almost like an entreaty. \u201cTak reflects the subtle turning of the world. It is a mirror we hold to life. No one wins a dance, boy. The point of dancing is the motion that a body makes. A well-played game of tak reveals the moving of a mind. There is a beauty to these things for those with eyes to see it.\u201d\nHe gestured at the brief and brutal lay of stones between us. \u201cLook at that. Why would I ever want to win a game such as this?\u201d\nI looked down at the board. \u201cThe point isn\u2019t to win?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cThe point,\u201d Bredon said grandly, \u201cis to play a beautiful game.\u201d He lifted his hands and shrugged, his face breaking into a beatific smile. \u201cWhy would I want to win anything other than a beautiful game?\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER SIXTY-SIX": ["CHAPTER SIXTY-SIX\nWithin Easy Reach\nLATER THAT EVENING I sat alone in what I guessed might be my drawing room. Or perhaps my sitting room. Honestly, I wasn\u2019t entirely sure what the difference was.\nI was surprised to find I liked my new rooms quite a lot. Not for the extra space. Not because they had a better view of the garden. Not because the inlay in the marble floor was more pleasing to the eye. Not even because the room had its own exceptionally well-stocked wine cabinet, though that was quite pleasant.\nNo. My new rooms were preferable because they had several cushioned, armless chairs that were perfect for playing my lute. It\u2019s uncomfortable to play for any length of time in a chair with armrests. In my previous room, I\u2019d usually ended up sitting on the floor.\nI decided to dub the room with the good chairs my lutery. Or perhaps my performatory. I would need a while to come up with something suitably pretentious.\nNeedless to say, I was pleased by the recent turn of events. By way of celebration, I opened a bottle of fine, dark Feloran wine, relaxed, and brought out my lute.\nI started quick and tripping, playing my way through \u201cTintatatornin\u201d to limber up my fingers. Then I played sweet and easy for a time, slowly growing reacquainted with my lute. By the time I\u2019d played for about half a bottle, I had my feet up and my music was mellow and content as a cat in a sunbeam.\nThat\u2019s when I heard the noise behind me. I stopped in a jangle of notes and sprang to my feet, expecting Caudicus, or the guards, or some other deadly trouble.\nWhat I found was the Maer, smiling an embarrassed smile, like a child that\u2019s just played a joke. \u201cI trust your new rooms are to your satisfaction?\u201d\nI collected myself and made a small bow. \u201cIt\u2019s rather much for the likes of", "me, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s rather little, considering my debt to you,\u201d Alveron said. He sat on a\nnearby couch and made a gracious gesture indicating I should feel free to take a seat myself. \u201cWhat was that you were playing just now?\u201d\nI returned to my chair. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really a proper song, your grace. I was just playing.\u201d\nThe Maer raised an eyebrow. \u201cIt was of your own devising?\u201d I nodded, and he motioned to me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have interrupted you. Please, continue.\u201d\n\u201cWhat would you like to hear, your grace?\u201d\n\u201cI have it on good report that Meluan Lackless is fond of music and sweet words,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething along those lines.\u201d\n\u201cThere are many types of sweet, your grace,\u201d I said. I played the opening to \u201cViolet Bide.\u201d The notes rang out light and sweet and sad. Then I changed to \u201cThe Lay of Savien,\u201d my fingers moving quickly through the complex chording, making it sound every bit as hard as it was.\nAlveron nodded to himself, his expression growing more satisfied as he listened. \u201cAnd you can compose as well?\u201d\nI nodded easily. \u201cI can, your grace. Though it takes time to do such things properly.\u201d\n\u201cHow much time?\u201d\nI shrugged. \u201cA day or two, or three. Depending on the sort of song you desire. Letters are easier.\u201d\nThe Maer leaned forward. \u201cIt pleases me that Threpe\u2019s praise was not exaggerated,\u201d he said. \u201cI will admit I moved you to these rooms with more than gratitude in mind. A passage connects them to my own rooms.We will need to meet frequently in order to discuss my courting.\u201d\n\u201cIt should prove most convenient, your grace,\u201d I said, then chose my next words carefully. \u201cI\u2019ve learned her family\u2019s history, but that will only go so far toward courting a woman.\u201d\nAlveron chuckled. \u201cYou must take me for a fool,\u201d he said gently. \u201cI know you\u2019ll need to meet her. She will be here in two days, visiting with a host of other nobility. I have declared a month of festivities to celebrate the passing of my long illness.\u201d\n\u201cClever,\u201d I complimented him.\nHe shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll arrange something to bring the two of you together early on. Is there anything you require for the practice of your art?\u201d\n\u201cA goodly amount of paper should suffice, your grace. Ink and pens.\u201d", "\u201cNothing more than that? I\u2019ve heard tell of poets who need certain extravagancies to aid them in their composition.\u201d He made an inarticulate gesture. \u201cA specific type of drink or scenery? I\u2019ve heard of a poet, quite famous in Renere, who has a trunk of rotting apples he keeps close at hand. Whenever his inspiration fails him, he opens it and breathes the fumes they emit.\u201d\nI laughed. \u201cI am a musician, your grace. Leave the poets to their superstitious bone rattling. All I need is my instrument, two good hands, and a knowledge of my subject.\u201d\nThe idea seemed to trouble Alveron. \u201cNothing to aid your inspiration?\u201d\n\u201cI would have your leave to freely wander the estates and Severen-Low according to my will, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\nI gave an easy shrug. \u201cIn that case, I have everything I need for inspiration within easy reach.\u201d\nI had barely set foot on Tinnery Street when I saw her. With all the fruitless searching I had done over the last several months, it seemed odd that I should find her so easily now.\nDenna moved through the crowd with slow grace. Not the stiffness that passes for grace in courtly settings, but a natural leisure of movement. A cat does not think of stretching, it stretches. But a tree does not even do this. A tree simply sways without the effort of moving itself. That is how she moved.\nI caught up to her as quickly as I could without attracting her attention. \u201cExcuse me, miss?\u201d\nShe turned. Her face brightened at the sight of me. \u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cI would never normally approach a woman in this way, but I couldn\u2019t help but notice that you have the eyes of a lady I was once desperately in love with.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a shame to love only once,\u201d she said, showing her white teeth in a wicked smile. \u201cI\u2019ve heard some men can manage twice or even more.\u201d\nI ignored her gibe. \u201cI am only a fool once. Never will I love again.\u201d\nHer expression turned soft and she laid her hand lightly on my arm. \u201cYou poor man! She must have hurt you terribly.\u201d\n \n\u201c\u2019Struth, she wounded me more ways than one.\u201d\n\u201cBut such things are to be expected,\u201d she said matter-of-factly. \u201cHow could a woman help but love a man so striking as yourself?\u201d\n\u201cI know not,\u201d I said modestly. \u201cBut I think she must not, for she caught me with an easy smile, then stole away without a word. Like dew in dawn\u2019s pale light.\u201d\n\u201cLike a dream upon waking,\u201d Denna added with a smile.\n\u201cLike a faerie maiden slipping through the trees.\u201d\nDenna was silent for a moment. \u201cShe must have been wondrous indeed, to\ncatch you so entire,\u201d she said, looking at me with serious eyes.\n\u201cShe was beyond compare.\u201d\n\u201cOh come now.\u201d Her manner changed to jovial. \u201cWe all know that when\nthe lights are out all women are the same height!\u201d She gave a rough chuckle and ribbed me knowingly with an elbow.\n\u201cNot true,\u201d I said with firm conviction.\n\u201cWell,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to take your word for it.\u201d She looked back up at me. \u201cPerhaps in time you can convince me.\u201d\nI looked into the deep brown of her eyes. \u201cThat has ever been my hope.\u201d\nDenna smiled and my heart stepped sideways in my chest. \u201cMaintain it.\u201d She slid her arm inside the curve of mine and fell into step beside me. \u201cFor without hope what do any of us have?\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER SIXTY-SEVEN": ["CHAPTER SIXTY-SEVEN\nTelling Faces\nI SPENT A FAIR PORTION of the next two days under Stapes\u2019 tutelage, ensuring I knew the proper etiquette for a formal dinner. I was already familiar with a great deal of it from my early childhood, but I was glad for the review. Customs differ from place to place and year to year, and even small missteps can lead to great embarrassment.\nSo Stapes conducted a dinner for just the two of us, then informed me of a dozen small but important mistakes I had made. Setting down a dirty utensil was considered crude, for example. That meant it was perfectly acceptable to lick one\u2019s knife clean. In fact, if you didn\u2019t want to dirty your napkin it was the only seemly thing to do.\nIt was improper to eat the entirety of a piece of bread. Some portion should always be left on the plate, preferably more than crust. The same was true of milk: the final swallow should always remain in the glass.\nThe next day Stapes staged another dinner and I made more mistakes. Commenting on the food wasn\u2019t rude, but it was rustic. The same was true of smelling the wine. And, apparently, the small soft cheese I\u2019d been served possessed a rind. A rind any civilized person would have recognized as inedible and meant to be pared away.\nBarbarian that I am, I had eaten all of it. It had tasted quite nice too. Still, I took note of this fact and resigned myself to throw away half of a perfectly good cheese if it was set in front of me. Such is the price of civilization.\nI arrived for the banquet wearing a suit of clothes tailored just for the occasion. The colors were good for me, leaf green and black. There was too much brocade for my taste, but tonight I made a grudging bow to fashion as I would be seated to the left of Meluan Lackless.\n \nStapes had staged six formal dinners for me in the last three days, and I felt prepared for anything. When I arrived outside the banquet hall, I expected the hardest part of the evening would be feigning interest in the food.\nBut while I might have been prepared for the meal, I was not prepared for the sight of Meluan Lackless herself. Luckily, my stage training took hold and I moved smoothly through the ritual motion of smiling and offering my arm. She nodded courteously and we made our procession to the table together.\nThere were tall candelabra with dozens of candles. Engraved silver pitchers held hot water for handbowls and cold water for drinking glasses. Old vases with elaborate floral arrangements sweetened the air. Cornucopia overflowed with polished fruit. Personally, I found it gaudy. But it was traditional, a showcase for the wealth of the host.\nI walked the Lady Lackless to the table and held out her chair. I had avoided looking in her direction as we walked the length of the room, but as I helped her into her seat, her profile struck me with such a strong resemblance that I couldn\u2019t help but stare. I knew her, I was certain of it. But I couldn\u2019t for the life of me remember where we might have met. . . .\nAs I took my seat, I tried to guess where I might have seen her before. If the Lackless lands weren\u2019t a thousand miles away, I would have thought I knew her from the University. But that was ridiculous. The Lackless heir wouldn\u2019t study so far from home.\nMy eyes wandered over maddeningly familiar features. Might I have met her at the Eolian? That didn\u2019t seem likely. I would have remembered. She was strikingly lovely, with a strong jaw and dark brown eyes. I\u2019m sure if I\u2019d seen her there . . .\n\u201cDo you see aught that interests you?\u201d she asked without turning to look at me. Her tone was pleasant, but accusation lay not far beneath the surface.\nI had been staring. Hardly a minute at table and I was already putting my elbow in the butter. \u201cI beg your pardon. But I am a keen observer of faces, and yours struck me.\u201d\nMeluan turned to look at me, her irritation fading a bit. \u201cAre you a turagior?\u201d\nTuragiors claimed to be able to tell your personality or future from your face, eyes, and the shape of your head. Pure-blooded Vintic superstition. \u201cI dabble a bit, m\u2019lady.\u201d\n\u201cReally? What does my face tell you then?\u201d She looked up and away from", "me.\nI made a show of looking over Meluan\u2019s features, taking note of her pale\nskin and artfully curled chestnut hair. Her mouth was full and red without the benefit of any paint. The line of her neck was proud and graceful.\nI nodded. \u201cI can see a piece of your future in it, m\u2019lady.\u201d\nOne of her eyebrows went up a bit. \u201cDo tell.\u201d\n\u201cYou will be receiving an apology shortly. Forgive my eyes, they flit like\nthe calanthis, place to place. I could not keep them from your fair flower face.\u201d\nMeluan smiled, but did not blush. Not immune to flattery, but no stranger to it either. I tucked that bit of information away. \u201cThat was a fairly easy fortune to tell,\u201d she said. \u201cSee you anything else?\u201d\nI took another moment to search her face. \u201cTwo other things, m\u2019lady. It tells me you are Meluan Lackless, and that I am at your service.\u201d\nShe smiled and gave me her hand to kiss. I took hold of it and bowed my head over it. I didn\u2019t actually kiss it, as would have been proper back in the Commonwealth, instead I pressed my lips briefly onto my own thumb that held her hand. Actually kissing her hand would have been terribly forward in this part of the world.\nOur banter was stalled by the arrival of the soups, forty servants placing them before forty guests all at once. I tasted mine. Why in God\u2019s name would anyone make a sweet soup?\nI ate another spoonful and pretended to enjoy it. From the corner of my eye, I watched my neighbor, a tiny, older man I knew to be the Viceroy of Bannis. His face and hands were wrinkled and spotted, his hair a disarrayed tousle of grey. I watched him put a finger into his soup without a hint of self- consciousness, taste it, then push the bowl aside.\nHe rummaged in his pockets and opened his hand to show me what he\u2019d found. \u201cI always bring a pocket full of candy almonds to these things,\u201d he said in a conspiratorial whisper, his eyes as cunning as a child\u2019s. \u201cYou never know what they\u2019ll try to feed you.\u201d He held his hand out. \u201cYou can have one if you like.\u201d\nI took one, thanked him, and faded from his awareness for the rest of the evening. When I glanced back several minutes later, he was eating unabashedly from his pocket and bickering with his wife about whether or not the peasantry could make bread from acorns. From the sound of it, I guessed it was a small piece of a larger argument that they had been having", "their entire lives.\nTo Meluan\u2019s right there was a Yllish couple, chatting away in their own\nlilting language. Combined with strategically placed decorations that made it difficult to see the guests on the other side of the table, Meluan and I were more alone than if we had been walking together in the gardens. The Maer had arranged his seating well.\nThe soup was taken away and replaced with a piece of meat I assumed was pheasant covered in a thick cream sauce. I was surprised to find it quite to my taste.\n\u201cSo how do you think we came to be paired?\u201d Meluan asked conversationally. \u201cMister . . .\u201d\n\u201cKvothe.\u201d I made a small seated bow. \u201cIt could be because the Maer wished you to be entertained, and I am at times entertaining.\u201d\n\u201cQuite.\u201d\n\u201cOr it could be I paid the steward an incredible sum of money.\u201d Her smile flickered again as she took a drink of water. Enjoys boldness, I thought to myself.\nI wiped my fingers and almost set the napkin on the table, which would have been a terrible mistake. That was a signal to remove whatever course was currently being served. Done too soon, it implied a silent but scathing criticism of the host\u2019s hospitality. I felt a bead of sweat begin to trickle down my back between my shoulder blades as I deliberately folded the napkin and laid it on my lap.\n\u201cSo how do you occupy yourself, Mr. Kvothe?\u201d\nShe hadn\u2019t asked as to my employment, which meant she assumed I was a member of the nobility. Luckily, I\u2019d already laid the groundwork for this. \u201cI write a bit. Genealogies. A play or two. Do you enjoy the theater?\u201d\n\u201cOccasionally. Depending.\u201d\n\u201cDepending on the play?\u201d\n\u201cDepending on the performers,\u201d she said, an odd tension touching her\nvoice.\nI wouldn\u2019t have noticed it if I hadn\u2019t been watching her so closely. I\ndecided to change the subject to safer ground.\n\u201cHow did you find the roads on your way to Severen?\u201d I asked. Everyone\nloves to complain about the roads. It\u2019s as safe a topic as the weather. \u201cI heard there has been some difficulty with bandits to the north.\u201d I hoped to excite the conversation a little. The more she talked, the better I could get to know her.", "\u201cThe roads are always thick with Ruh bandits this time of year,\u201d Meluan said coldly.\nNot just bandits, Ruh bandits. She said the word with such a weight of cold loathing in her voice that I was chilled to hear it. She hated the Ruh. Not the simple distaste most people feel for us, but a true, sharp hate with teeth in it.\nI was saved from making a response by the arrival of chilled fruit pastries. To my left the viceroy argued acorns to his wife. To my right, Meluan slowly tore a strawberry pastry in half, her face pale as an ivory mask. Watching her flawless polished nails tear the pastry into pieces, I knew her thoughts were dwelling on the Ruh.\nAside from her brief mention of the Edema Ruh, the evening went quite well. I slowly set Meluan at her ease, talking casually of small things. The elaborate dinner lasted two hours, giving us ample time for discussion. I found her to be everything Alveron had suggested: intelligent, attractive, and well-spoken. Even the knowledge that she loathed the Ruh could not entirely keep me from enjoying her company.\nI returned to my room immediately after dinner and began to write. By the time the Maer came to call I had three drafts of a letter, an outline of a song, and five sheets filled with notes and phrases I hoped to use later.\n\u201cCome in, your grace.\u201d I glanced up as he entered. He hardly seemed the same sickly, doddering man I\u2019d nursed back to health. He\u2019d put on some weight and looked five years younger.\n\u201cWhat did you think of her?\u201d Alveron said. \u201cDid she mention any suitors when you spoke?\u201d\n\u201cNo, your grace,\u201d I said, handing him a folded piece of paper. \u201cHere is the first letter you will want to send to her. I trust you can find a way of delivering it to her secretly?\u201d\nHe unfolded it and began to read, his lips moving silently. I labored out another line of song, scratching out the chording alongside the words.\nEventually the Maer looked up. \u201cDon\u2019t you think this is a little much?\u201d he said uncomfortably.\n\u201cNo.\u201d I paused in my writing long enough to gesture with my pen toward a different piece of paper.\u201cThat one is too much. The one in your hand is just\n \nenough. She\u2019s got a streak of romance in her. She wants to be swept from her feet, though she\u2019d probably deny it.\u201d\nThe Maer\u2019s expression was still doubtful so I pushed myself away from the table and set down my quill. \u201cYour grace, you were right. She is a woman well worthy of pursuit. In a handful of days there will be a dozen men in the estates who would gladly take her to wife, am I right?\u201d\n\u201cThere are already a dozen here,\u201d he said grimly. \u201cSoon there will be three dozen.\u201d\n\u201cAdd another dozen she will meet at dinner or walking in the garden. Then another dozen who will court her merely for the chase. Of those dozens, how many will write her letters and poems? They will send her flowers, trinkets, tokens of affection. Soon she will be receiving a deluge of attention. You have one, best hope.\u201d\nI pointed to the letter. \u201cAct quickly. That letter will catch her imagination, her curiosity. In a day or two, when the other notes are cluttering her desk, she will already be awaiting the second one of ours.\u201d\nHe seemed to hesitate a moment, then his shoulders bowed. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cThere are no certainties in this, your grace. Only hopes. That is the best one I can give you.\u201d\nAlveron hesitated. \u201cI know nothing of this,\u201d he said with a hint of petulance. \u201cI wish there were some book of rules a man could follow.\u201d For a moment he looked very much like an ordinary man and very little like the Maer Alveron at all.\nTruthfully, I was more than slightly concerned myself. What I personally knew about courting women could comfortably fit into a thimble without taking it off your finger first.\nOn the other hand, I had a vast wealth of secondary knowledge. Ten thousand romantic songs, plays, and stories taken all together had to be worth something. And on the negative side, I\u2019d seen Simmon pursue nearly every woman within three miles of the University with the doomed enthusiasm of a child trying to fly. What\u2019s more, I had watched a hundred men dash themselves to pieces against Denna like ships attempting to ignore the tide.\nAlveron looked at me, his face still showing honest concern. \u201cWill a month be enough time, do you think?\u201d\nWhen I spoke, I was surprised by the confidence in my own voice. \u201cYour grace, if I cannot help you catch her in the space of a month, then it cannot be", "done.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER SIXTY-EIGHT": ["CHAPTER SIXTY-EIGHT\nThe Cost of a Loaf\nTHE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED were pleasant ones. My sunlight hours were spent with Denna in Severen-Low, exploring the city and surrounding countryside. We spent time riding, swimming, singing, or simply talking the afternoons away. I flattered her outrageously and without hope, because only a fool would hope to catch her.\nThen I would return to my rooms and pen the letter that had been building inside me all day. Or I would pour out a torrent of song to her. And in that letter or song I said all the things I hadn\u2019t dared to tell Denna during the day. Things I knew would only frighten her away.\nAfter I finished the letter or the song, I would write it again. I would dull its edges a little, remove an honesty or two. I slowly smoothed and stitched until it fit Meluan Lackless as snugly as a calfskin glove.\nIt was idyllic. I had better luck finding Denna in Severen than I ever had in Imre. We met for hours at a stretch, sometimes more than once a day, sometimes three or four days in a row.\nThough, in the interest of honesty, things were not perfect. There were a few burrs in the blanket, as my father used to say.\nThe first was a young gentleman named Gerred who accompanied Denna on one of our early meetings down in Severen-Low. He didn\u2019t know her as Denna, of course. He called her Alora, and so did I for the rest of the day.\nGerred\u2019s face held the doomed expression I had come to know very well. He had known Denna long enough to fall for her, and he was just beginning to realize his time was drawing to an end.\nI watched as he made the same mistakes I\u2019d seen others make before him. He put his arm around her possessively. He gave her the gift of a ring. As we strolled the city, if her eye focused on anything for more than three seconds he offered to buy it for her. He tried to pin her down with a promise of some future meeting. A dance at the DeFerre\u2019s manse? Dinner at the Golden Board? The Tenpenny King was being performed tomorrow by Count", "Abelard\u2019s men. . . ?\nIndividually, any of these things would have been fine. Perhaps even\ncharming. But taken together they showed themselves as pure, white- knuckled desperation. He clutched at Denna as if he were a drowning man and she a plank of wood.\nHe glared at me when she wasn\u2019t watching, and when Denna bid the two of us good-bye that evening, his face was drawn and white as if he were already two days dead.\nThe second burr was worse. After I\u2019d been helping the Maer court his lady for almost two span, Denna disappeared. No trace or word of warning. No note of farewell or apology. I waited for three hours at the livery where we\u2019d agreed to meet. After that I went to her inn, only to find that she had left with all her things the night before.\nI went to the park where we had taken lunch the previous day, then to a dozen other places where we\u2019d made a habit of each other\u2019s company. It was near midnight by the time I took the lifts back to the top of the Sheer. Even then some foolish part of me hoped she would greet me at the top, rushing into my arms again with her wild enthusiasm.\nBut she wasn\u2019t there. That night I wrote no letter or song for Meluan.\nThe second day I ghosted through Severen-Low for hours, worried and wounded. Later that night in my rooms, I sweat and cursed and crumpled my way through twenty sheets of paper before I arrived at three brief, half- tolerable paragraphs which I gave to the Maer to do with as he wished.\nThe third day my heart sat like a stone in my chest. I tried to finish the song I\u2019d been writing for the Maer, but nothing worthwhile came of my efforts. For the first hour the notes I played were leaden and lifeless. The second hour they grew discordant and faltering. I pressed on until every sound my lute made grated like a knife against teeth.\nI finally let my poor, tortured lute fall silent, remembering something my father had said long ago: \u201cSongs choose their hour and their own season. When your tune\u2019s tin, there is a reason. The tone of a tune is your heart\u2019s mettle, and there\u2019s no clear water from a muddy well. All you can do is let the silt settle, or you\u2019ll sound sour as a broken bell.\u201d\nI lowered my lute into its case, knowing the truth of it. I needed a few days before I could productively return to courting Meluan on the Maer\u2019s behalf. The work was too delicate to force or fake.\nOn the other hand, I knew the Maer would not be pleased with a delay. I", "needed a diversion, and since the Maer was too clever by half, it needed to be at least halfway legitimate.\nI heard the telltale sigh of air that signaled the Maer\u2019s secret passage opening in my dressing room. I made sure I was pacing anxiously by the time he came through the doorway.\nAlveron had continued to put on weight in the last two span, and his face was no longer hollow and drawn. He cut quite a figure in his finery, a creamy ivory shirt and stiff jacket of deep sapphire blue. \u201cI got your message,\u201d he said brusquely. \u201cHave you finished the song then?\u201d\nI turned to face him. \u201cNo, your grace. Something more important than the song has come to my attention.\u201d\n\u201cAs far as you are concerned, there is nothing more important than the song,\u201d the Maer said firmly, tugging the cuff of his shirt to straighten it. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from several people that Meluan was greatly pleased with the first two. You should focus the whole of your efforts in that direction.\u201d\n\u201cYour grace, I am well aware that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOut with it,\u201d Alveron said impatiently, glancing at the face of the tall gear-clock that stood in the corner of the room. \u201cI have appointments to keep.\u201d\n\u201cYour life is in further danger from Caudicus.\u201d\nI\u2019ll give this to the Maer, he could have made his living on the stage. The only break in his composure was a brief hesitation as he tugged his other cuff into place. \u201cAnd how is that?\u201d he asked, apparently unconcerned.\n\u201cThere are ways for him to harm you other than poison. Things that can be done from a distance.\u201d\n\u201cA spell, you mean,\u201d Alveron said. \u201cHe means to conjure up a sending and set it to bedevil me?\u201d\nTehlu anyway, spells and sendings. It was easy to forget this intelligent, subtle, and otherwise educated man was little better than a child when it came to arcane matters. He probably believed in faeries and the walking dead. Poor fool.\nHowever, attempting to reeducate him would be tiresome and counterproductive. \u201cThere is a chance of that, your grace. As well as other,\n \nmore direct threats.\u201d\nHe dropped some of his unconcerned pose and looked me in the eye.\n\u201cWhat could be more direct than a sending?\u201d\nThe Maer was not the sort of man to be moved through words alone, so I\npicked up an apple from a bowl of fruit and polished it on my sleeve before handing it to him. \u201cWould you hold this for a moment, your grace?\u201d\nHe took it, suspiciously. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about then?\u201d\nI walked over to where my lovely burgundy cloak hung on the wall, and retrieved a needle from one of its many pockets. \u201cI\u2019m showing you the sort of thing Caudicus is capable of, your grace.\u201d I held out my hand for the apple.\nHe gave it back and I looked it over. Holding it at an angle to the light, I saw what I\u2019d hoped for, smudged onto the glossy skin of the apple. I muttered a binding, focused my Alar, and pushed the needle into the center of the blurry imprint his forefinger had made on the apple\u2019s skin.\nAlveron twitched and made an inarticulate noise of surprise, staring at his hand as if it had been unexpectedly, say, pricked with a pin.\nI\u2019d half-expected him to rebuke me, but he did nothing of the sort. His eyes went wide, his face pale. Then his expression grew thoughtful as he watched the bead of blood swell on the pad of his finger.\nHe licked his lips and slowly put his finger into his mouth. \u201cI see,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cSuch things can be guarded against?\u201d It wasn\u2019t really a question.\nI nodded, keeping my expression grave. \u201cSomewhat, your grace. I believe I can create a . . . a charm to protect you. I only regret I didn\u2019t think of this sooner, but with one thing and another\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes.\u201d The Maer waved me into silence. \u201cAnd what will you require for such a charm?\u201d\nIt was a layered question. On the surface he was asking what materials I would need. But the Maer was a practical man. He was asking me my price as well.\n\u201cThe workshop in Caudicus\u2019 tower should have the equipment I need, your grace. What materials he doesn\u2019t have on hand, I should be able to find in Severen, given time.\u201d\nThen I paused, considering the second portion of his question, thinking of the hundred things the Maer could grant me: money enough to swim in, a newly crafted lute of the sort only kings could afford. I felt a shock run through me at the thought. An Antressor lute. I\u2019d never even seen one, but my father had. He\u2019d played one once in Anilin, and sometimes when he\u2019d", "had a cup of wine he would talk about it, his hands making gentle shapes in the air.\nThe Maer could arrange this sort of thing in the blink of an eye.\nAll that and more, of course. Alveron could arrange access to a hundred private libraries. A formal patronage would be no small thing either, coming from him. The Maer\u2019s name would open doors as quickly as the king\u2019s.\n\u201cThere are a few things,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cThat I have been hoping to discuss with your grace. I have a project I need assistance to pursue properly. And I have a friend, a talented musician, who could use a well-placed patron. . . .\u201d I trailed off meaningfully.\nAlveron nodded, his grey eyes showing he understood. The Maer was no fool. He knew the cost of a loaf. \u201cI\u2019ll have Stapes get you the keys to Caudicus\u2019 tower,\u201d he said. \u201cHow long will this charm take to produce?\u201d\nI paused as if considering. \u201cAt least four days, your grace.\u201d That would give me time for the muddy waters of my creative well to clear. Or time for Denna to return from whatever errand had pulled her suddenly away. \u201cIf I was sure of his equipment, it could be sooner, but I will have to move carefully. I don\u2019t know what Caudicus might have done to foul things before he fled.\u201d\nAlveron frowned at this. \u201cWill you be able to continue your current projects as well?\u201d\n\u201cNo your grace. It will be rather exhausting and time-consuming. Especially since I\u2019m assuming you\u2019d prefer I be circumspect while gathering my materials in Severen-Low?\u201d\n\u201cYes of course.\u201d He exhaled hard through his nose. \u201cDamn and bother, things were going so well. Who can I bring in to write letters while you\u2019re occupied?\u201d He said the last musingly, mostly to himself.\nI needed to nip that thought in the bud. I did not want to share credit for Meluan\u2019s courtship with anyone. \u201cI don\u2019t think that will be necessary, your grace. Seven or eight days ago, perhaps. But now, as you say, we have her interest. She is excited, eager for the next contact. If a few days pass with nothing from us, she will be disappointed. But more importantly, she will be anxious for the return of your attention.\u201d\nThe Maer smoothed his beard with one hand, his expression pensive. I considered making a comparison to playing a fish on a line, but I doubted the Maer had ever engaged in anything so rustic as fishing. \u201cNot to presume, your grace. But in your younger days, did you ever attempt to win the", "affection of a young lady?\u201d\nAlveron smiled at my careful phrasing. \u201cYou may presume.\u201d\n\u201cWhich did you find more interesting? The ones who leapt to your arms\nstraightaway, or those who were more difficult, reluctant, even indifferent to your pursuit?\u201d The Maer\u2019s eyes were far away with remembering. \u201cThe same is true of women. Some cannot bear it when a man clings to them. And they all appreciate space to make their own choices. It\u2019s hard to long for something that is always there.\u201d\nAlveron nodded. \u201cThere is some truth in that. Absence feeds affection.\u201d He nodded more firmly. \u201cVery well. Three days.\u201d He glanced at the gear clock again. \u201cAnd now I must be\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOne final thing, your grace,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cThe charm I will make must be tuned specifically to you. It will require some of your cooperation.\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cMore precisely, some of your . . .\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cSubstance.\u201d\n\u201cSpeak plainly.\u201d\n\u201cA small amount of blood, saliva, skin, hair, and urine.\u201d I sighed internally, knowing that to someone of the superstitious Vintic mind-set, this would sound like a recipe for a sending or some other equally ridiculous thing.\nAs I\u2019d expected, the Maer\u2019s eyes narrowed at the list. \u201cWhile I am no expert,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cthose seem to be the very things I should avoid parting with. How can I trust you?\u201d\nI could have protested my loyalty, pointed out my past service, or brought to his attention that I\u2019d already saved his life. But over the last month I\u2019d come to know how the Maer\u2019s mind worked.\nI gave him my best knowing smile. \u201cYou are an intelligent man, your grace. I\u2019m sure you know the answer without my telling you.\u201d\nHe returned my smile. \u201cHumor me, then.\u201d\nI shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re of no use to me if you\u2019re dead, your grace.\u201d\nHis grey eyes searched mine for a moment, then nodded, satisfied. \u201cVery\ntrue. Send a message when you need those things.\u201d He turned to leave. \u201cThree days.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER SIXTY-NINE": ["CHAPTER SIXTY-NINE\nSuch Madness\nIMADE SEVERAL TRIPS TO Severen-Low to gather materials for Alveron\u2019s gram. Raw gold. Nickel and iron. Coal and etching acids. I acquired the money for these purchases by selling off various pieces of equipment from Caudicus\u2019 workshop. I could have asked the Maer for money, but I\u2019d rather he thought of me as independently resourceful rather than an ongoing financial drain.\nQuite by coincidence, in the course of this buying and selling, I visited many of the places Denna and I had spent time together.\nI\u2019d grown so accustomed to finding her that now I caught glimpses of her when she wasn\u2019t there. Every day my hopeful heart rose at the sight of her turning a corner, stepping into a cobbler\u2019s, raising her hand to wave from across a courtyard. But it was never truly her, and I returned to the Maer\u2019s estate each evening more desolate than the day before.\nMaking things worse was the fact that Bredon had left Severen several days ago to visit some nearby relatives. I didn\u2019t realize how much I\u2019d come to depend on him until he was gone.\nAs I\u2019ve already said, a gram is not particularly difficult to make if you have the proper equipment, a schema, and an Alar like a blade of Ramston steel. The metalworking tools in Caudicus\u2019 tower were serviceable, though nowhere near as nice as those in the Fishery. The schema was no difficulty either, as I have a good memory for such things.\nWhile I was working on the Maer\u2019s gram, I started a second one to replace the one I\u2019d lost. Unfortunately, given the relatively crude nature of the equipment I was working with, I didn\u2019t have time to finish it properly.\nI finished the Maer\u2019s gram three days after talking to the Maer, six days after Denna\u2019s sudden disappearance. The following day I abandoned my pointless searching and planted myself in one of the open air-caf\u00e9s where I drank coffee and tried to find inspiration for the song I owed the Maer. Ten hours I spent there, and the only act of creation I accomplished was to", "magically transform nearly a gallon of coffee into marvelous, aromatic piss. That night I drank an unwise amount of scutten and fell asleep at my\nwriting desk. Meluan\u2019s song was still unfinished. The Maer was less than pleased.\nDenna reappeared on the seventh day as I wandered our haunts in Severen- Low. Despite all my searching, she saw me first and ran laughing to my side, excited to tell me about a song she\u2019d heard the day before. We spent the day together as easily as if she\u2019d never left.\nI didn\u2019t ask her about her unexplained disappearance. I\u2019d known Denna for more than a year now, and I understood a few of the hidden turnings of her heart. I knew she valued her privacy. I knew she had secrets.\nThat night, we were in a small garden that ran along the very edge of the Sheer. We sat on a wooden bench looking out over the dark city below: a messy splay of lamplight, streetlight, gaslight, with a few rare sharp points of sympathy light scattered throughout.\n\u201cI am sorry, you know,\u201d she said softly.\nWe\u2019d been sitting, quietly watching the lights of the city for nearly a quarter hour. If she was continuing some previous conversation, I couldn\u2019t remember what it was. \u201cBeg pardon?\u201d\nWhen Denna didn\u2019t say anything immediately, I turned to look at her. There was no moon, and the night was dark. Her face was dimly illuminated by the thousand lights below.\n\u201cSometimes I leave,\u201d she said at last. \u201cQuick and quiet in the night.\u201d\nDenna didn\u2019t look at me as she spoke, keeping her dark eyes fixed on the city below. \u201cIt\u2019s what I do,\u201d she continued, her voice quiet. \u201cI leave. No word or warning first. No explanation after. Sometimes it\u2019s the only thing that I can do.\u201d\nShe turned to meet my eyes then, her face serious in the dim light. \u201cI hope you know without my telling you,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope I don\u2019t need to say it. . . .\u201d\nDenna turned back to look at the glimmering lights below. \u201cBut for what it\u2019s worth, I am sorry.\u201d\nWe sat for a while then, enjoying a comfortable silence. I wanted to say\n \nsomething. I wanted to say it didn\u2019t bother me, but that would be a lie. I wanted to tell her all that really mattered to me was that she came back, but I was worried that might be too much truth.\nSo rather that risk saying the wrong thing, I said nothing. I knew what happened to the men who clung to her too tightly. That was the difference between me and the others. I did not clutch at her, try to own her. I did not slip my arm around her, murmur in her ear, or kiss her unsuspecting cheek.\nCertainly, I thought of it. I still remembered the warmth of her when she had thrown her arms around me near the horse lift. There were times I would have given my right hand to hold her again.\nBut then I thought of the faces of the other men when they realized Denna was leaving them. I thought of all the others who had tried to tie her to the ground and failed. So I resisted showing her the songs and poems I had written, knowing that too much truth can ruin a thing.\nAnd if that meant she wasn\u2019t entirely mine, what of it? I would be the one she could always return to without fear of recrimination or question. So I did not try to win her and contented myself with playing a beautiful game.\nBut there was always a part of me that hoped for more, and so there was a part of me that was always a fool.\nDays passed, and Denna and I explored the streets of Severen. We lounged in caf\u00e9s, attended plays, went riding. We climbed the face of the Sheer using the low road just to say we\u2019d done it. We visited the dock markets, a traveling menagerie, and several curiosity cabinets.\nSome days we did nothing but sit and talk, and on those days, nothing filled our conversations as much as music.\nWe spent countless hours discussing the craft of it. How songs fit together. How chorus and verse play against each other, about tone and mode and meter.\nThese were things I\u2019d learned at an early age and thought about often. And though Denna was new to this study, in some ways that worked to her advantage. I\u2019d learned about music since before I could talk. I knew ten thousand rules of melody and verse better than I knew the backs of my own hands.\n \nDenna didn\u2019t. In some ways this hampered her, but in other ways it made her music strange and marvelous. . . .\nI\u2019m doing a poor job of explaining this. Think of music as being a great snarl of a city like Tarbean. In the years I spent living there, I came to know its streets. Not just the main streets. Not just the alleys. I knew shortcuts and rooftops and parts of the sewers. Because of this, I could move through the city like a rabbit in a bramble. I was quick and cunning and clever.\nDenna, on the other hand, had never been trained. She knew nothing of shortcuts. You\u2019d think she\u2019d be forced to wander the city, lost and helpless, trapped in a twisting maze of mortared stone.\nBut instead, she simply walked through the walls. She didn\u2019t know any better. Nobody had ever told her she couldn\u2019t. Because of this, she moved through the city like some faerie creature. She walked roads no one else could see, and it made her music wild and strange and free.\nIn the end it took twenty-three letters, six songs, and, though it shames me to say it, one poem.\nThere was more to it than that, of course. Letters alone cannot win a woman\u2019s heart. Alveron did a fair piece of his own courting. And after he revealed himself as Meluan\u2019s anonymous suitor, he did the lion\u2019s share of the work, slowly wooing Meluan to his side with the gentle reverence he felt for her.\nBut my letters caught her attention. My songs brought her close enough for Alveron to work his slow, garrulous charm.\nEven so, I can take only a small piece of credit for the letters and songs. And as for the poem, there is only one thing in the world that could move me to such madness.\n \n"], "CHAPTER SEVENTY": ["CHAPTER SEVENTY\nClinging\nI MET DENNA OUTSIDE HER inn on Chalker\u2019s Lane, a little place called the Four Tapers. As I turned the corner and saw her standing in the light cast by a lantern hanging above the front door, I felt an upwelling of joy at the simple pleasure of being able to find her when I went looking.\n\u201cI got your note,\u201d I said. \u201cImagine my delight.\u201d\nDenna smiled and made a one-handed curtsey. She was wearing a skirt, not a complicated dress of the sort a noblewoman would wear, but a simple sweep of fabric you could wear while bucking hay or going to a barn dance. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you would be able to make it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt being past the hour most civilized folk have taken to their beds.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll admit I was surprised,\u201d I said. \u201cIf I was the sort of man to pry, I would wonder what kept you occupied until this most unseemly hour.\u201d\n\u201cBusiness,\u201d she said with a dramatic sigh. \u201cA meeting with my patron.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s in town again?\u201d I asked.\nShe nodded.\n\u201cAnd he wanted to meet you at midnight?\u201d I asked. \u201cThat\u2019s . . . odd.\u201d Denna stepped out from under the inn\u2019s sign and we began to walk down\nthe street together. \u201cThe hand that holds the purse . . .\u201d she said, giving a helpless shrug. \u201cOdd times and inconvenient places are the rule with Master Ash. Some part of me suspects he might simply be some lonely noble, bored with ordinary patronage. I wonder if it adds some spice for him, pretending he\u2019s meshed in some dark intrigue instead of just commissioning some songs from me.\u201d\n\u201cSo what do you have planned for tonight?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cOnly to pass time in your lovely company,\u201d Denna said, reaching out and linking her arm with mine.\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d I said, \u201cI have something to show you. It\u2019s a surprise. You\u2019ll have to trust me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard each of those a dozen times.\u201d Denna\u2019s dark eyes glittered", "wickedly. \u201cBut never all together, and never from you.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll give you the benefit of the doubt and save my world-weary gibes for later. Take me where you will.\u201d\nSo we made our way to Severen-High by way of the horse lifts, where we both gawked at the lights of the nighttime city below like the lowborn cretins we were. I took her on a long stroll through cobblestone streets, past shops and small gardens. Then we left the buildings behind, climbed over a low wooden fence, and moved toward the dark shape of an empty barn.\nAt this, Denna was no longer able to keep quiet. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve done it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve surprised me.\u201d\nI grinned at her and continued to lead the way into the dark of the barn. It was full of the smell of hay and absent animals. I led her to a ladder that disappeared into the dark above our heads.\n\u201cA hayloft?\u201d she demanded, her voice incredulous. She stopped walking and gave me an odd, curious look. \u201cYou obviously have me mistaken for a fourteen-year-old farm girl named . . .\u201d Her mouth worked soundlessly for a moment. \u201cSomething rustic.\u201d\n\u201cGretta,\u201d I suggested.\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cYou obviously have me mistaken for a low-bodiced farm girl named Gretta.\u201d\n\u201cRest assured,\u201d I said. \u201cIf I were going to try to seduce you, this isn\u2019t the way I would go about it.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d she said, running her hand through her hair. Her fingers began to idly twine her hair into a braid, then she stopped and brushed it out. \u201cIn that case, what are we doing here?\u201d\n\u201cYou mentioned how much you enjoyed gardens,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd Alveron\u2019s gardens are particularly fine. I thought you might enjoy a turn about the place.\u201d\n\u201cIn the middle of the night,\u201d Denna said.\n\u201cA charming moonlit stroll,\u201d I corrected.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no moon tonight,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cOr if there is, it\u2019s barely a\nslender sliver.\u201d\n\u201cBe that as it may,\u201d I said, refusing to be daunted. \u201cHow much moonlight\ndoes one actually need to enjoy the smell of gently blooming jasmine?\u201d \u201cIn the hayloft,\u201d Denna said, her voice thick with disbelief.\n\u201cThe hayloft is the easiest way onto the roof,\u201d I said. \u201cThence into the\nMaer\u2019s estates. Thence to the garden.\u201d", "\u201cIf you\u2019re in the Maer\u2019s employ,\u201d she said, \u201cwhy not simply ask him to let you in?\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d I said dramatically, holding up a finger. \u201cTherein lies the adventure. There are a hundred men who could simply take you strolling in the Maer\u2019s the gardens. But there is only one who can sneak you in.\u201d I smiled at her. \u201cWhat I\u2019m offering you, Denna, is a singular opportunity.\u201d\nShe grinned at me. \u201cYou know my secret heart so well.\u201d\nI extended my hand as if I were about to assist her into a carriage. \u201cM\u2019lady.\u201d\nDenna took my hand, then stopped as soon as she put her foot onto the first rung of the ladder. \u201cHold on, you aren\u2019t being genteel. You\u2019re trying to get a look up my dress.\u201d\nI gave her my best offended look, pressing my hand to my chest. \u201cLady, as a gentleman I assure you\u2014\u201d\nShe swatted at me. \u201cYou\u2019ve already told me you\u2019re not a gentleman,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re a thief, and you\u2019re trying to steal a look.\u201d She stepped back and made a parody of my courtly gesture of a moment before. \u201cM\u2019lord . . .\u201d\nWe made our way through the hayloft, onto the roof, and into the garden. The sharp sliver of moon above us was thin as a whisper, so pale that it did nothing to dim the light of the stars.\nThe gardens were surprisingly quiet for such a warm and lovely night. Ordinarily even at this late hour couples would be strolling the paths, or murmuring to each other on the bower benches. I wondered if some ball or courtly function had pulled them all away.\nThe Maer\u2019s gardens were vast, with curving paths and cunningly placed hedges making them seem larger still. Denna and I walked side by side, listening to the sigh of the wind through the leaves. It was like we were the only people in the world.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you remember,\u201d I said softly, not wanting to intrude upon the silence. \u201cA conversation we had some time ago. We talked of flowers.\u201d\n\u201cI remember,\u201d she said just as softly.\n\u201cYou said you thought all men had got their lessons in courting from the same worn book.\u201d\nDenna laughed quietly, more a motion than a sound. She put her hand to her mouth. \u201cOh. I\u2019d forgotten. I did say that, didn\u2019t I? \u201d\nI nodded. \u201cYou said they all brought you roses.\u201d\n\u201cThey still do,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish they would find a new book.\u201d", "\u201cYou made me pick a flower that would suit you better,\u201d I said.\nShe smiled up at me shyly. \u201cI remember, I was testing you.\u201d Then she frowned. \u201cBut you got the better of me by picking one I\u2019d never heard of, let alone seen.\u201d\nWe turned a corner and the path led toward the dark green tunnel of an arching bower. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen them yet,\u201d I said. \u201cBut here is your selas flower.\u201d\nThere were only stars lighting our way. The moon so slender it was almost no moon at all. Under the trellis it was dark as Denna\u2019s hair.\nOur eyes were wide and stretching to the dark, and where the starlight slanted through the leaves, they showed hundreds of selas blossoms yawning open in the night. If the scent of selas were not so delicate, it would have been overpowering.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Denna sighed, looking around with wide eyes. Under the bower, her skin was brighter than the moon. She reached out her hands to both sides. \u201cThey\u2019re so soft!\u201d\nWe walked in silence. All around us selas vines wove themselves around the trellis, clinging to the wood and wire, hiding their faces from the nighttime sky. When eventually we came out the other side, it seemed as bright as daylight.\nThe silence stretched until I started to grow uncomfortable. \u201cSo now you know your flower,\u201d I said. \u201cIt seemed a shame you\u2019d never seen one. They\u2019re rather difficult to cultivate, from what I\u2019ve heard.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps they do suit me then,\u201d Denna said softly, looking down. \u201cI don\u2019t take root easily.\u201d\nWe continued walking until the path turned and hid the bower behind us. \u201cYou treat me better than I deserve,\u201d Denna said at last.\nI laughed at the ridiculousness of that. Only respect for the silence of the\ngarden kept it from rolling out of me in a great booming laugh. Instead I stifled it as much as possible, though the effort threw me off my stride and made me stumble.\nDenna watched me from a step away, a smile spreading across her mouth.\nEventually I caught my breath. \u201cYou who sang with me the night I won my pipes. You who have given me the finest gift I ever did receive.\u201d A thought occurred to me. \u201cDid you know,\u201d I said, \u201cthat your lute case saved my life?\u201d\nThe smile spread and grew, wide as a flower. \u201cDid it now?\u201d\n\u201cIt did,\u201d I said. \u201cI cannot ever hope to treat you as well as you deserve.", "Given what I owe you, this is but the smallest payment.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I think it is a lovely start.\u201d She looked up at the sky and drew a\nlong, deep breath. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked moonless nights best. It\u2019s easier to say things in the dark. It\u2019s easier to be yourself.\u201d\nShe began walking again and I fell into step beside her. We passed a fountain, a pool, a wall of pale jasmine open to the night. We crossed a small stone bridge that led us back among the shelter of the hedges.\n\u201cYou could put your arm around me, you know,\u201d she said matter-of-factly. \u201cWe are walking in the gardens, alone. In the moonlight, such as it is.\u201d Denna looked sideways at me, the side of her mouth quirking upward. \u201cSuch things are permitted, you realize.\u201d\nHer sudden change in manner caught me off my guard. Since we had met in Severen I had courted her with wild, hopeless pageantry, and she had matched me without missing a beat. Each flattery, each witticism, each piece of playful banter she returned to me, not in an echo but a harmony. Our back- and-forth had been like a duet.\nBut this was different. Her tone was less playful and more plain. It was so sudden a change that I was at a loss for words.\n\u201cFour days ago I turned my foot on that loose flagstone,\u201d she said softly. \u201cRemember? We were walking on Mincet Lane. My foot slipped and you caught me almost before I knew that I was stumbling. It made me wonder how closely you must be watching me to see something like that.\u201d\nWe turned a corner in the path, and Denna continued to speak without looking up at me. Her voice was soft and musing, almost as if she were talking to herself. \u201cYou had your hands on me then, sure as anything, steadying me. You almost had your arm around me. It would have been so easy for you then. A matter of inches. But when I got my feet beneath me, you took your hands away. No hesitation. No lingering. Nothing I might take amiss.\u201d\nShe started to turn her face to me, then stopped and looked down again. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a thing,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are so many men, all endlessly attempting to sweep me off my feet. And there is one of you, trying just the opposite. Making sure my feet are firm beneath me, lest I fall.\u201d\nAlmost shyly, she reached out. \u201cWhen I move to take your arm, you accept it easily. You even lay your hand on mine, as if to keep it there.\u201d She explained my movement exactly as I was making it, and I fought to keep the gesture from becoming suddenly awkward. \u201cBut that\u2019s all. You never", "presume. You never push. Do you know how strange that is to me?\u201d We looked at each other for a moment, there, in the silent moonlight\ngarden. I could feel the heat of her standing close to me, her hand clinging to my arm.\nInexperienced as I was with women, even I could read this cue. I tried to think of what to say, but I could only wonder at her lips. How could they be so red as this? Even the selas was dark in the faint moonlight. How were her lips so red?\nThen Denna froze. Not that we were moving much, but in a moment she went from motionless to still, cocking her head like a deer straining to catch a half-heard sound. \u201cSomeone\u2019s coming,\u201d she said. \u201cCome on.\u201d Clinging to my arm, she pulled me off the path, over a stone bench, and through a low, narrow gap in the hedges.\nWe finally came to rest in the center of some thick bushes. There was a convenient hollow where we both had room to crouch. Thanks to the work of the gardeners there was no undergrowth to speak of, no dry leaves or twigs to crackle or snap under our hands and knees. In fact, the grass in this sheltered place was thick and soft as any lawn.\n\u201cThere are a thousand girls who could walk with you along the moonlit garden paths,\u201d Denna said breathlessly. \u201cBut there\u2019s only one who\u2019ll hide in the shrubbery with you.\u201d She grinned at me, her voice bubbling with amusement.\nDenna peered out of the hedge toward the path, and I looked at her. Her hair fell like a curtain down the side of her head, and the tip of her ear was peeking out through it. It was, at that moment, the most lovely thing that I had ever seen.\nThen I heard the faint grit of footsteps on the path. The soft sound of voices came sifting through the hedge, a man and a woman. After a moment they came walking around the corner, arm in arm. I recognized them immediately.\nI turned and leaned close, breathing softly into Denna\u2019s ear. \u201cThat\u2019s the Maer,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd his young ladylove.\u201d\nDenna shivered, and I shrugged out of my burgundy cloak, draping it over her shoulders.\nI peered back out at the two of them. As I watched, Meluan laughed at something he said and rested her hand atop his on her arm. I doubted he\u2019d have much more need of my services if they were already on such familiar", "terms as that.\n\u201cNot for you, my dear,\u201d I heard the Maer say clearly as they passed near\nus. \u201cYou shall have nothing but roses.\u201d\nDenna turned to look at me, her eyes wide. She pressed both her hands\nagainst her mouth to stifle her laugher.\nIn another moment they were past us, strolling slowly along, walking in\nstep. Denna removed her hands and took several deep, shuddering breaths. \u201cHe has a copy of the same worn book,\u201d she said, her eyes dancing.\nI couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cApparently.\u201d\n\u201cSo that\u2019s the Maer,\u201d she said quietly, her dark eyes peering between the leaves. \u201cHe\u2019s shorter than I imagined.\u201d\n\u201cWould you like to meet him?\u201d I asked. \u201cI could introduce you.\u201d\n\u201cOh that would be lovely,\u201d she said with a gentle edge of mockery. She chuckled, but when I didn\u2019t join her laughter, she looked up at me and stopped. \u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d She cocked her head to one side, her expression trapped between amusement and confusion.\n\u201cWe probably shouldn\u2019t burst out of the hedge at him,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut we could come out on the other side and loop around to meet him.\u201d I gestured with my hand at the route we could take. \u201cI\u2019m not saying he\u2019ll invite us to dinner or anything. But we can make a polite nod as we pass him on the path.\u201d\nDenna continued to stare at me, her eyebrows furrowing in the faint beginning of a frown. \u201cYou\u2019re serious,\u201d she repeated.\n\u201cWhat do you . . .\u201d I stopped as I realized what her expression meant. \u201cYou thought I was lying about working for the Maer,\u201d I said. \u201cYou thought I was lying about being able to invite you in here.\u201d\n\u201cMen tell stories,\u201d she said dismissively. \u201cThey like to brag a bit. I didn\u2019t think any less of you for telling me a bit of a tall tale.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t lie to you,\u201d I said, then reconsidered. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not the truth. I would. You\u2019re worth lying for. But I wasn\u2019t. You\u2019re worth telling the truth for too.\u201d\nDenna gave me fond smile. \u201cThat\u2019s harder to come by anyway.\u201d\n\u201cSo would you like to?\u201d I asked. \u201cMeet him, I mean?\u201d\nShe looked out of the hedge toward the path. \u201cNo.\u201d When she shook her\nhead her hair moved like drifting shadows. \u201cI believe you. There\u2019s no need.\u201d She looked down. \u201cBesides, I\u2019ve got grass stains on my dress. What would he think?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve got leaves in my hair,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI know exactly what he would think.\u201d\nWe stepped out from the hedge. I picked the leaves out of my hair and Denna brushed her hands down the front of her skirt, wincing a bit as she moved over the grass stains.\nWe made our way back onto the path and started walking again. I thought of putting my arm around her, but didn\u2019t. I was no good judge of these things, but it seemed the moment had passed.\nDenna looked up as we passed a statue of a woman picking a flower. She sighed. \u201cIt was more exciting when I didn\u2019t know I had permission,\u201d she admitted with a little regret in her voice.\n\u201cIt always is,\u201d I agreed.", ""], "CHAPTER SEVENTY-ONE": ["CHAPTER SEVENTY-ONE\nInterlude\u2014The Thrice-locked Chest\nKVOTHE RAISED HIS HAND, motioning Chronicler to stop. The scribe wiped the nib of his pen on a nearby cloth and rolled his shoulder stiffly. Wordlessly, Kvothe brought out a worn deck of cards and began to deal them around the table. Bast picked up his cards and looked them over curiously.\nChronicler frowned. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d\nFootsteps sounded on the wooden landing outside, and the door to the Waystone Inn opened, revealing a bald, thick-bodied man wearing an embroidered jacket.\n\u201cMayor Lant!\u201d the innkeeper said, putting down his cards and getting to his feet. \u201cWhat can I do for you? A drink? A bite to eat?\u201d\n\u201cA glass of wine would be quite welcome,\u201d the mayor said as he moved into the room. \u201cDo you have any red Gremsby in?\u201d\nThe innkeeper shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid not,\u201d he said. \u201cThe roads, you know. It\u2019s hard to keep things in stock.\u201d\nThe mayor nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll take anything red then,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I won\u2019t pay more than a penny for it, mind you.\u201d\n\u201cOf course not, sir,\u201d the innkeeper said solicitously, wringing his hands a bit. \u201cAnything to eat?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d the bald man said. \u201cI\u2019m actually here to make use of the scribe. I thought I\u2019d wait until things quieted down a bit, so we could have some privacy.\u201d He looked around the empty room. \u201cI don\u2019t imagine you\u2019d mind my borrowing the place for half an hour, would you?\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d The innkeeper smiled ingratiatingly. He made a shooing motion to Bast.\n\u201cBut I had a full board!\u201d Bast protested, waving his cards.\nThe innkeeper frowned at his assistant, then headed back into the kitchen. The mayor removed his jacket and laid it across the back of a chair while\nBast gathered up the rest of the cards, grumbling.\nThe innkeeper brought out a glass of red wine, then locked the front door", "with a large brass key. \u201cI\u2019ll take the boy upstairs with me,\u201d he said to the mayor, \u201cto give you some privacy.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s exceedingly kind of you,\u201d the mayor said as he sat across from Chronicler. \u201cI\u2019ll give a shout when I\u2019m finished.\u201d\nThe innkeeper nodded and herded Bast out of the common room and up the stairs. Kvothe opened the door to his room and gestured Bast inside.\n\u201cI wonder what old Lant wants to keep secret,\u201d Kvothe said as soon as the door was closed behind them. \u201cI hope he\u2019s not too long about it.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s got two children by the Widow Creel,\u201d Bast said matter-of-factly. Kvothe raised an eyebrow at that. \u201cReally?\u201d\nBast shrugged. \u201cEveryone in town knows.\u201d\nKvothe humphed at this as he settled down into a large upholstered chair.\n\u201cWhat are we going to do with ourselves for half an hour?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been ages since we\u2019ve had lessons.\u201d Bast pulled a wooden chair away\nfrom the small desk and sat on the edge of it. \u201cYou could teach me something.\u201d\n\u201cLessons,\u201d Kvothe mused. \u201cYou could read Celum Tinture.\u201d\n\u201cReshi,\u201d Bast said imploringly. \u201cIt\u2019s so boring. I don\u2019t mind lessons, but do they need to be book lessons?\u201d\nBast\u2019s tone wrung a smile from Kvothe. \u201cA puzzle lesson then?\u201d Bast\u2019s face broke into a grin. \u201cVery well, let me think for a second.\u201d He tapped his fingers against his lips and let his eyes wander the room. It wasn\u2019t long before they were drawn to the foot of the bed where the dark chest lay.\nHe made a casual gesture. \u201cHow would you open my chest if you had a mind to?\u201d\nBast\u2019s expression grew slightly apprehensive. \u201cYour thrice-locked chest, Reshi?\u201d\nKvothe looked at his student, then laughter bubbled up out of him. \u201cMy what?\u201d he asked incredulously.\nBast blushed and looked down. \u201cThat\u2019s just how I think of it,\u201d he mumbled.\n\u201cAs names go . . .\u201d Kvothe hesitated, a smile playing around his mouth. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a little storybook, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who made the thing, Reshi,\u201d Bast said sullenly. \u201cThree locks and fancy wood and all that. It\u2019s not my fault if it sounds storybook.\u201d\nKvothe leaned forward and rested an apologetic hand on Bast\u2019s knee. \u201cIt\u2019s a fine name, Bast. Just caught me off my guard is all.\u201d He leaned back again.", "\u201cSo. How would you attempt to plunder the thrice-locked chest of Kvothe the Bloodless?\u201d\nBast smiled. \u201cYou sound like a pirate when you say it that way, Reshi.\u201d He gave the chest a speculative look from across the room. \u201cI suppose asking you for the keys is out of the question?\u201d he asked at last.\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cFor our purposes, assume I have lost the keys. Better yet, assume I am dead, and you are now free to pry into all my secret things.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a little grim, Reshi,\u201d Bast reproached gently.\n\u201cLife is a little grim, Bast,\u201d Kvothe said without any hint of laughter in his voice. \u201cYou\u2019d best start getting used to it.\u201d He waved a hand toward the chest. \u201cGo on, I\u2019m curious to see how you go about cracking this little chestnut.\u201d\nBast gave him a flat look. \u201cPuns are worse than book lessons, Reshi,\u201d he said, walking over to the chest. He nudged it idly with his foot, then bent and looked at the two separate lock plates, one dark iron, the other bright copper. Bast prodded the rounded lid with a finger, wrinkling his nose. \u201cI can\u2019t say as I care for this wood, Reshi. And the iron lock is positively unfair.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a useful lesson this has already been,\u201d Kvothe said dryly. \u201cYou\u2019ve deduced a universal truth: things are usually unfair.\u201d\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t any hinges, either!\u201d Bast exclaimed, looking at the back of the chest. \u201cHow can you have a lid without any hinges?\u201d\n\u201cThat did take me a while to work out,\u201d Kvothe admitted with a touch of pride.\nBast got down on his hands and knees and looked into the copper keyhole. He lifted one hand and pressed it flat against the copper plate. Then he closed his eyes and went very still, as if he were listening.\nAfter a moment of this, he leaned forward and breathed against the lock. When nothing happened, his mouth began to move. While his words were spoken too softly to hear, they carried an undeniable tone of entreaty.\nAfter a long moment of this, Bast sat back on his haunches, frowning. Then he grinned playfully, reached out with a hand, and knocked on the lid of the chest. It made barely any noise at all, as if he were rapping his knuckle against a stone.\n\u201cOut of curiosity,\u201d Kvothe asked. \u201cWhat would you do if something knocked back?\u201d\nBast came to his feet, left the room, and returned a moment later with an", "assortment of tools. He got to one knee and, using a piece of bent wire, fiddled with the copper lock for several long minutes. Eventually he began to curse under his breath. When he shifted position to get a different angle, his hand brushed the dull iron faceplate of the lock and he jerked back, hissing and spitting.\nGetting back to his feet, Bast threw down the wire and brought out a long prybar of bright metal. He tried to work the thin end of it under the lid, but couldn\u2019t gain any purchase in the hair-thin seam. After a few minutes he abandoned this as well.\nNext, Bast tried to tip the chest on its side to examine the bottom, but his best efforts only managed to slide it an inch or so across the floor. \u201cHow much does this weigh, Reshi?\u201d Bast exclaimed, looking rather exasperated. \u201cThree hundred pounds?\u201d\n\u201cOver four hundred when it\u2019s empty,\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cRemember the trouble we had getting it up the stairs?\u201d\nSighing, Bast examined the chest for another long moment, his expression fierce. Then he extracted a hatchet from his bundle of tools. It wasn\u2019t the rough, wedge-headed hatchet they used to cut kindling behind the inn. It was slender and menacing, all forged of a single piece of metal. The shape of its blade was vaguely reminiscent of a leaf.\nHe tossed the weapon lightly in his palm, as if testing its weight. \u201cThis is where I would go next, Reshi. If I were genuinely interested in getting inside.\u201d He gave his teacher a curious look. \u201cBut if you\u2019d rather I not. . . .\u201d\nKvothe made a helpless gesture. \u201cDon\u2019t look to me, Bast. I\u2019m dead. Do as you will.\u201d\nBast grinned and brought the hatchet down on the rounded peak of the chest. There was a strange, soft, ringing noise, like a padded bell being struck in a distant room.\nBast paused, then rained a flurry of angry blows down on the top of the chest. First swinging wildly with one hand, then using both hands in great overhand chopping motions, as if he were splitting wood.\nThe bright, leaf-shaped blade refused to bite into the wood, each blow turning aside as if Bast were attempting to chop apart a great, seamless block of stone.\nEventually Bast stopped, breathing hard, and bent to look at the top of the chest, running his hand over the surface before turning his attention to the hatchet\u2019s blade. He sighed. \u201cYou do good work, Reshi.\u201d", "Kvothe smiled and tipped an imaginary hat.\nBast gave the chest a long look. \u201cI\u2019d try to set fire to it, but I know Roah doesn\u2019t burn. I\u2019d have better luck getting it hot enough so the copper lock would melt. But to do that, I\u2019d need to get the whole thing to sit face down in a forge fire.\u201d He looked at the chest, large as a gentleman\u2019s traveling trunk. \u201cBut it would have to be a bigger forge than the one we have here in town. And I don\u2019t even know how hot copper needs to be in order to melt.\u201d\n\u201cInformation such as that,\u201d Kvothe said, \u201cwould doubtless be the subject of a book lesson.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I expect you\u2019ve taken precautions against that sort of thing.\u201d\n\u201cI have,\u201d Kvothe admitted. \u201cBut it was a good idea. It shows lateral thinking.\u201d\n\u201cAnd acid?\u201d Bast said. \u201cI know we have some potent stuff downstairs. . . .\u201d\n\u201cFormic is useless against Roah.\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cAs is the muriatic. You might have some luck with Aqua Regius. But the wood is quite thick, and we don\u2019t have much on hand.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking of the wood, Reshi. I was thinking of the locks again. With enough acid I could eat clean through them.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re assuming they are copper and iron all the way through,\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cEven if they were, it would take a great deal of acid, and you would have to worry about the acid itself spilling into the chest, ruining whatever\u2019s inside. The same is true with the fire, of course.\u201d\nBast looked at the chest for another long moment, stroking his lips thoughtfully. \u201cThat\u2019s all I have, Reshi. I\u2019ll need to think on it some more.\u201d\nKvothe nodded. Looking somewhat disheartened, Bast gathered up his tools and carried them away. When he returned, he pushed the chest from the other side, sliding it back a fraction of an inch until it was square with the foot of the bed again.\n\u201cIt was a good attempt, Bast,\u201d Kvothe reassured him. \u201cVery methodical. You went about it just as I would have.\u201d\n\u201cHullo?\u201d the mayor\u2019s voice came hollowly up from the room below. \u201cI\u2019m finished.\u201d\nBast hopped up and hurried to the door, pushing his chair back under the desk. The sudden motion disturbed one of the crumpled sheets of paper resting there, causing it to tumble to the floor where it bounced and rolled beneath the chair.\nBast paused, then bent to pick it up.", "\u201cNo,\u201d Kvothe said grimly. \u201cLeave it.\u201d Bast stopped with his hand outstretched, then stood and left the room.\nKvothe followed, closing the door behind them.", ""], "CHAPTER SEVENTY-TWO": ["CHAPTER SEVENTY-TWO\nHorses\nSEVERAL DAYS AFTER DENNA and I had our moonlit stroll in the garden, I finished a song for Meluan called \u201cNothing but Roses.\u201d The Maer specifically requested it, and I had leapt to the project with a will, knowing that Denna would laugh herself sick when I played it for her.\nI slid the Maer\u2019s song into an envelope and looked at the clock. I\u2019d thought I\u2019d be busy the entire night finishing it, but it had come with surprising ease. Consequently, I had the rest of the evening free. It was late, but not terribly late. Not late for Cendling night in a lively city like Severen. Perhaps not too late to find Denna.\nI threw on a set of fresh clothes and hurried out of the estates. Since the money in my purse came from selling pieces of Caudicus\u2019 equipment and playing cards with nobles who knew more about fashion than statistics, I paid the full bit for the horse lifts, then jogged the half-mile to Newell Street. I slowed to a walk for the last several blocks. Enthusiasm is flattering, but I didn\u2019t want to arrive at Denna\u2019s inn panting and sweating like a lathered horse.\nI wasn\u2019t surprised when I didn\u2019t find her at the Four Tapers. Denna wasn\u2019t the sort to sit and twiddle her thumbs just because I was busy. But the two of us had spent the better part of a month exploring the city together, and I had a few good guesses as to where I might find her.\nFive minutes later I spotted her. She was moving through the crowded street with a definite purpose, walking as if she had somewhere important to be.\nI started to make my way toward her, then hesitated. Where would she be going so purposefully, alone, so late at night?\nShe was going to meet her patron.\nI wish I could say I agonized before I decided to follow her, but I really didn\u2019t. The temptation of finally learning the identity of her patron was simply too strong.", "So I put up the hood of my cloak and began to ghost through the crowd behind Denna. It\u2019s remarkably easy if you have a little practice. I used to make a game of it in Tarbean, seeing how far I could follow someone without being seen. It helped that Denna wasn\u2019t a fool and stayed in the good parts of the city where the streets were busy, and in the dim light my cloak looked a nondescript black.\nI followed her for half an hour. We passed cart vendors selling chestnuts and greasy meat pies. Guards mingled with the crowd, and the streets were bright with scattered streetlights and lanterns hung outside the doors of inns. An occasional out-at-the-heels musician played with his hat in front of him, and once we passed a troupe of mummers acting out a play in a small cobblestone square.\nThen Denna turned and left the better streets behind. Soon there were fewer lights and tipsy revelers. The musicians gave way to beggars who called out or clutched at your clothes as you walked by. Lamplight still poured through the windows of nearby pubs and inns, but the street was no longer bustling. People clustered in twos or threes, women wearing corsets and men with hard eyes.\nThese streets weren\u2019t dangerous, strictly speaking. Or rather, they were dangerous in a broken glass sort of way. Broken glass won\u2019t go out of its way to hurt you. You can even touch it if you\u2019re careful. Some streets are dangerous as frothing dogs, where no amount of care will keep you safe.\nI was beginning to get nervous when I saw Denna stop suddenly at the mouth of a shadowed alley. She craned her neck for a moment, as if listening to something. Then, after peering into the dark, she darted inside.\nWas this where she was meeting her patron? Was she taking a shortcut to a different street? Or was she simply following her paranoid patron\u2019s instructions to make sure no one followed her?\nI began to curse under my breath. If I followed her into the alley and she saw me, it would be obvious I\u2019d been trailing her. But if I didn\u2019t follow her, I\u2019d lose her. And while this wasn\u2019t a truly dangerous part of the city, I didn\u2019t want to leave her walking alone so late at night.\nSo I scanned the nearby buildings and spotted one fronted with crumbling fieldstone. After a quick glance around, I climbed the face of it quick as a squirrel, another useful skill from my misspent youth.\nOnce I was on the roof, it was a simple matter to run over the tops of several other buildings, then slink into the shadow of a chimney before", "peering down into the alley. There was a sliver of moon overhead, and I expected to see Denna striding quickly along her shortcut, or having a hushed and hidden meeting with her dodgy patron.\nBut what I saw was nothing of the sort. Dim lamplight from an upstairs window showed a woman splayed out motionless on the ground. My heart thudded hard for several beats until I realized it wasn\u2019t Denna. Denna was dressed in shirt and pants. This woman\u2019s white dress was crumpled around her, her bare legs pale against the dark stone of the street.\nMy eyes darted around until I saw Denna outside the window\u2019s light. She stood close to a broad-shouldered man with moonlight shining on his bald head. Was she embracing him? Was this her patron?\nFinally my eyes adjusted enough that I could see the truth: the two were standing very close and still, but she wasn\u2019t holding him. She had one hand hard against his neck, and I saw white moonlight glitter on metal there, like a distant star.\nThe woman on the ground started to stir, and Denna called out to her. The woman climbed unsteadily to her feet, staggering a bit as she stepped on her own dress, then edged slowly past them, keeping close to the wall as she made her way to the mouth of the alley.\nOnce the woman was behind her, Denna said something else. I was too far away to make out any of the words, but her voice was hard and angry enough to raise the hair on the back of my arms.\nDenna stepped away from the man and he backed away, one hand going to the side of his throat. He began to curse her viciously, spitting and making grasping motions with his free hand. His voice was louder than hers, but slurred enough that I couldn\u2019t make out much of what he said, though I did identify the word \u201cwhore\u201d several times.\nBut for all his talk, he didn\u2019t come anywhere close to within arm\u2019s reach of her. Denna simply stood facing him, her feet set squarely on the ground. She held the knife low in front of her, tilted at an angle. Her posture was almost casual. Almost.\nAfter cursing for a minute or so, the man took half a shuffling step forward, shaking a fist. Denna said something and made a short, sharp gesture with the knife towards the man\u2019s groin. Silence filled the alley and the man\u2019s shoulders shifted a bit. Denna made the gesture again, and the man began to curse more softly, turning away and walking down the alley, his hand still pressed to the side of his neck.", "Denna watched him go, then relaxed and slid the knife carefully into her pocket. She turned and walked to the mouth of the alleyway.\nI scurried to the front of the building. On the street below I saw Denna and the other woman standing under a streetlamp. In the better light I saw the woman was much younger than I\u2019d thought, just a slip of a girl, her shoulders heaving with sobs. Denna rubbed her back in small circles, and the girl slowly calmed down. After a moment they began walking down the street.\nI hurried back to the alley where I had spotted an old iron drainpipe, a relatively easy way to get back down onto the street. But even so it cost me two long minutes and most of the skin off my knuckles to get cobblestones back under my feet.\nOnly through a pure effort of will did I keep myself from running out of the alley to catch up with Denna and the girl. The last thing I wanted was for Denna to discover I\u2019d been following her.\nLuckily, they weren\u2019t moving very fast, and I caught sight of them easily. Denna led the girl back to the nicer part of the city, then took her into a respectable-looking inn with a painted rooster on the sign.\nI stood outside for a minute, peering at the layout of the inn through one of the windows. Then I settled my hood more firmly over my face, walked casually around the back portion of the inn, and slid into a seat on the other side of a dividing wall, just around the corner from Denna and the young girl. If I\u2019d wanted to, I could have leaned forward to peer at their table, but as it was, neither one of us could see the other.\nThe taproom was mostly empty, and a serving girl came up to me almost as soon as I took my seat. She eyed the rich fabric of my cloak and smiled. \u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d\nI eyed the impressive array of polished glass behind the bar. I motioned the serving girl closer and spoke softly, with a rasp in my throat, as if I were recovering from the croup cough. \u201cI\u2019ll take a tumble of your best whiskey,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd a glass of fine Feloran red.\u201d\nShe nodded and left.\nI turned my finely tuned eavesdroppers\u2019 ears to the next table.\n\u201c. . . your accent,\u201d I heard Denna say. \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d\nThere was a pause and a murmur as the girl spoke. Since she was facing\naway from me, I couldn\u2019t hear what she said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s in the western farrel isn\u2019t it?\u201d Denna asked. \u201cYou\u2019re a long way\nfrom home.\u201d", "There was murmuring from the girl. Then a long pause where I couldn\u2019t hear anything. I couldn\u2019t tell if she\u2019d stopped talking, or if she was speaking too quietly for me to hear. I fought the urge to lean forward and peer at their table.\nThen the murmuring came back, very soft.\n\u201cI know he said he loved you,\u201d Denna said, her voice gentle. \u201cThey all say that.\u201d\nThe serving girl set a tall wineglass in front of me and handed me my tumble. \u201cTwo bits.\u201d\nMerciful Tehlu. With prices like that, no wonder the place was nearly empty.\nI tossed back the whiskey in a single swallow, fighting the urge to cough as it burned down my throat. Then I drew a full silver round out of my purse, set the heavy coin on the table, and put the empty tumble down over the top of it.\nI motioned the serving girl close again. \u201cI have a proposal for you,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cRight now I want nothing more than to sit here quietly, drink my wine, and think my thoughts.\u201d\nI tapped the overturned tumble with the coin underneath. \u201cIf I am allowed to do this without interruption, all of this, less the cost of my drinks, is yours.\u201d Her eyes went a little wide at that, darting down to the coin again. \u201cBut if anyone comes over to bother me, even in a helpful way, even to ask if I would like anything to drink, I will simply pay and leave.\u201d I looked up at her. \u201cCan you help me get a little privacy tonight?\u201d\nShe nodded eagerly.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said.\nShe hurried away and went immediately to another woman standing\nbehind the bar, making a few gestures in my direction. I relaxed a bit, reasonably certain they wouldn\u2019t be drawing any attention to me.\nI sipped my wine and listened.\n\u201c. . . does your father do?\u201d Denna asked. I recognized the pitch of her voice. It was the same low, gentle tone my father had used when talking to skittish animals. A tone designed to calm someone and set them at their ease.\nThe girl murmured, and Denna responded. \u201cThat\u2019s a fine job. What are you doing here then?\u201d\nAnother murmur.\n\u201cGot handsy, did he?\u201d Denna said matter-of-factly. \u201cWell that\u2019s the nature of eldest sons.\u201d", "The girl spoke up again, this time with some fire in her voice, though I still couldn\u2019t make out any of the words.\nI buffed the surface of my wineglass a little with the edge of my cloak, then tipped it out and away from me a bit. The wine was so deep a red that it was almost black. It made the side of the glass act like a mirror. Not a wonderful mirror, but I could see tiny shapes at the table around the corner.\nI heard Denna sigh, cutting off the low murmur of the girl\u2019s voice. \u201cLet me guess,\u201d Denna said, sounding exasperated. \u201cYou stole the silver, or something similar, then ran off to the city.\u201d\nThe small reflection of the girl just sat there.\n\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t like you thought it would be, was it?\u201d Denna said, more gently this time.\nI could see the girl\u2019s shoulders begin to shake and heard a series of faint, heartbreaking sobs. I looked away from the wineglass and set it back on the table.\n\u201cHere.\u201d There was the sound of a glass being knocked onto the table. \u201cDrink that,\u201d Denna said. \u201cIt will help a bit. Not a lot. But a bit.\u201d\nThe sobbing stopped. The girl gave a surprised cough, choking a little.\n\u201cYou poor, silly thing,\u201d Denna said softly. \u201cMeeting you is worse than looking in a mirror.\u201d\nFor the first time, the girl spoke loudly enough for me to hear her. \u201cI thought, if he\u2019s going to take me anyway and get it for free, I might as well go somewhere I can pick and choose and get paid for it. . . .\u201d\nHer voice trailed off until I couldn\u2019t make out any words, leaving only the low rise and fall of her muffled voice.\n\u201cThe Tenpenny King?\u201d Denna interrupted incredulously. Her tone more venomous than anything I\u2019d ever heard from her before. \u201cKist and crayle, I hate that Goddamn play. Modegan faerie-story trash. The world doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d\n\u201cBut . . .\u201d the girl began.\nDenna cut her off. \u201cThere\u2019s no young prince out there, dressed in rags and waiting to save you. Even if there were, where would you be? You\u2019d be like a dog he\u2019d found in the gutter. He\u2019d own you. After he took you home, who would save you from him?\u201d\nA piece of silence. The girl coughed again, but only a little. \u201cSo what are we going to do with you?\u201d Denna said.\nThe girl sniffed and said something.", "\u201cIf you could take care of yourself we wouldn\u2019t be sitting here,\u201d Denna said.\nA murmur.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an option,\u201d Denna said. \u201cThey\u2019ll take half of what you make, but that\u2019s better than getting nothing and having your throat slit on top of it. I\u2019m guessing you figured that out yourself tonight.\u201d\nThere was the sound of cloth on cloth. I tipped my wineglass to get a look, but all I saw was Denna making some indistinct motion. \u201cLet\u2019s see what we have here,\u201d she said. Then there came the familiar clatter of coins on a table.\nThe girl made an awed murmur.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d Denna said. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much when it\u2019s all your money in the world. You should know by now how expensive it is to make your own way in the city.\u201d\nA murmur that rose at the end. A question.\nI heard Denna draw a breath, then let it out again slowly. \u201cBecause someone helped me once when I needed it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd because if you don\u2019t get some help you\u2019ll be dead in a span of days. Take it from someone who\u2019s made her own share of bad decisions.\u201d\nThere was the sound of coins sliding on the table. \u201cOkay,\u201d Denna said. \u201cFirst option. We get you apprenticed up. You\u2019re a little old, and it will cost, but we could do it. Nothing fancy. Weaving. Cobbling. They\u2019ll work you hard, but you\u2019d have your room and board, and you\u2019d learn a trade.\u201d\nA questioning murmur.\n\u201cWith your accent?\u201d Denna asked archly. \u201cCan you curl a lady\u2019s hair? Paint her face? Mend her dress? Tat lace?\u201d A pause. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t have the training to be a maidservant, and I wouldn\u2019t know who to bribe.\u201d\nThe sound of coins being gathered together. \u201cOption two,\u201d Denna said. \u201cWe get you a room until that bruise is gone.\u201d Coins sliding. \u201cThen buy you a seat on a coach back home.\u201d More coins. \u201cYou\u2019ve been gone a month. That\u2019s the perfect amount of time for some serious worry to set in. When you come home they\u2019ll just be happy you\u2019re alive.\u201d\nMurmur.\n\u201cTell them whatever you like,\u201d Denna said. \u201cBut if you\u2019ve got half a brain in your head you\u2019ll make it sensible. Nobody\u2019s going to believe you met some prince who sent you home.\u201d\nA murmur so soft I could hardly hear it.\n\u201cOf course it will be hard, you silly little bint,\u201d Denna said sharply.", "\u201cThey\u2019ll hold it over your head for the rest of your life. Folk will whisper when you walk by on the street. It will be hard to find a husband. You\u2019ll lose friends. But that\u2019s the price you\u2019ll have to pay if you want to have anything like your normal life back again.\u201d\nThe coins clinked as they were gathered together again. \u201cThird option. If you\u2019re certain you want to make a go of whoring, we can arrange it so you don\u2019t end up dead in a ditch. You\u2019ve got a nice face, but you\u2019ll need proper clothes.\u201d Coins sliding. \u201cAnd someone to teach you manners.\u201d More coins. \u201cAnd someone else to get rid of that accent of yours.\u201d Coins again.\nMurmur.\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s the only sensible way to do it,\u201d Denna said flatly. Another murmur.\nDenna gave a tight, irritated sigh. \u201cOkay. Your father\u2019s stable master,\nright? Think about the different horses the baron owns: plow horses, carriage horses, hunting horses. . . .\u201d\nExcited murmur.\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Denna said. \u201cSo if you had to pick, what sort of horse would you want to be? A plow horse works hard, but does it get the best stall? The best feed?\u201d\nMurmur.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. That goes to the fancy horses. They get petted and fed and only have to work when there\u2019s a parade or someone goes hunting.\u201d\nDenna continued, \u201cSo if you\u2019re going to be a whore, you do it smart. You don\u2019t want to be some dockside drab, you want to be a duchess. You want men to court you. Send you gifts.\u201d\nMurmur.\n\u201cYes, gifts. If they pay, they\u2019ll feel like they own you. You saw how that turned out tonight. You can keep your accent and that low bodice and have sailors paw you for ha\u2019penny a throw. Or you can learn some manners, get your hair done, and start entertaining gentlemen callers. If you\u2019re interesting, and pretty, and you know how to listen, men will desire your company. They\u2019ll want to take you dancing as much as take you to bed. Then you have the control. Nobody makes a duchess pay for her room in advance. Nobody bends a duchess over a barrel in an alley then kicks out her teeth once he\u2019s had his fun.\u201d\nMurmur.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Denna said, her voice grim. There was the sound of coins being", "clinked softly into a purse. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to yourself. Even the fanciest horse is still a horse. That means sooner or later, you\u2019re going to get ridden.\u201d\nA questioning murmur.\n\u201cThen you leave,\u201d Denna said. \u201cIf they want more than you\u2019re willing to give, that\u2019s the only way. You leave, quick and quiet in the night. But if you do, you\u2019ll burn your bridges. That\u2019s the price you pay.\u201d\nA hesitant murmur.\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that,\u201d Denna said. \u201cYou need to decide what you want for yourself. You want to go home? There\u2019s a price. You want control over your life? There\u2019s a price. You want the freedom to say no? There\u2019s a price. There\u2019s always a price.\u201d\nThere was the sound of a chair being pushed away from a table, and I pressed myself back against the wall as I heard the two of them stand up. \u201cIt\u2019s something everyone has to figure out on their own,\u201d Denna said, her voice growing more distant. \u201cWhat do you want more than anything else? What do you want so badly you\u2019ll pay anything to get it?\u201d\nI sat for a long time after they left, trying to drink my wine.", ""], "CHAPTER SEVENTY-THREE": ["CHAPTER SEVENTY-THREE\nBlood and Ink\nIN THE THEOPHANY, Teccam writes of secrets, calling them painful treasures of the mind. He explains that what most people think of as secrets are really nothing of the sort. Mysteries, for example, are not secrets. Neither are little-known facts or forgotten truths. A secret, Teccam explains, is true knowledge actively concealed.\nPhilosophers have quibbled over his definition for centuries. They point out the logical problems with it, the loopholes, the exceptions. But in all this time none of them has managed to come up with a better definition. That, perhaps, tells us more than all the quibbling combined.\nIn a later chapter, less argued over and less well-known, Teccam explains that there are two types of secrets. There are secrets of the mouth and secrets of the heart.\nMost secrets are secrets of the mouth. Gossip shared and small scandals whispered. These secrets long to be let loose upon the world. A secret of the mouth is like a stone in your boot. At first you\u2019re barely aware of it. Then it grows irritating, then intolerable. Secrets of the mouth grow larger the longer you keep them, swelling until they press against your lips. They fight to be let free.\nSecrets of the heart are different. They are private and painful, and we want nothing more than to hide them from the world. They do not swell and press against the mouth. They live in the heart, and the longer they are kept, the heavier they become.\nTeccam claims it is better to have a mouthful of poison than a secret of the heart. Any fool will spit out poison, he says, but we hoard these painful treasures. We swallow hard against them every day, forcing them deep inside us. There they sit, growing heavier, festering. Given enough time, they cannot help but crush the heart that holds them.\nModern philosophers scorn Teccam, but they are vultures picking at the bones of a giant. Quibble all you like, Teccam understood the shape of the", "world.\nThe day after I\u2019d followed Denna through the city, she sent me a note, and I met her outside the Four Tapers. We\u2019d met there dozens of times in the last several span, but today something was different. Today Denna wore a long, elegant dress, not layered and high necked in the current fashion, but close fitting and open at the throat. It was a deep blue, and when she took a step I could glimpse a long stretch of her bare leg beneath.\nHer harp case leaned against the wall behind her, and she had an expectant look in her eye. Her dark hair was lustrous in the sunlight, unadorned except for three narrow braids tied with blue string. She was barefoot, and her feet were grass-stained. She smiled.\n\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d she said, excitement thrumming through her voice like distant thunder. \u201cDone enough to play you a piece at any rate. Would you like to hear it?\u201d I caught a bit of well-hidden shyness in her voice.\nAs we were both working for patrons who valued their privacy, Denna and I didn\u2019t often discuss our work. We compared our ink-stained fingers and bemoaned our difficulties, but only in vague ways.\n\u201cI\u2019d like nothing better than to hear it,\u201d I said as Denna picked up her harp case and started down the street. I fell into step beside her. \u201cBut won\u2019t your patron mind?\u201d\nDenna gave a too-casual shrug. \u201cHe says he wants my first song to be something that men will sing for a hundred years, so I doubt he\u2019ll want me to keep it bottled up forever.\u201d She gave me a sideways look. \u201cWe\u2019ll go somewhere private and I\u2019ll let you hear. So long as you don\u2019t go shouting it from rooftops, I should be safe.\u201d\nWe started walking to the western gate by unspoken agreement. \u201cI\u2019d have brought my lute,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I finally found a luthier I trust. I\u2019m having that loose peg mended.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll serve me best as audience today,\u201d she said. \u201cSit rapt in admiration as I play. Tomorrow I\u2019ll watch you, all dewy-eyed with wonder. I\u2019ll marvel at your skill and wit and charm.\u201d She moved her harp to her other shoulder and grinned at me. \u201cProvided you aren\u2019t having them mended at the shop.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m always up for a duet,\u201d I suggested. \u201cHarp and lute is rare but not\n \nunheard of.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s delicately phrased.\u201d She glanced sideways at me. \u201cI\u2019ll think on it.\u201d As I had a dozen times before, I fought the urge to tell her I\u2019d reclaimed\nher ring from Ambrose. I wanted to tell her the story of it, mistakes and all. But I was fairly certain the romantic impact of my gesture would be diminished by the end of the story, where I\u2019d effectively pawned the ring before I left Imre. Better to keep it a secret for now, I thought, and surprise her with the ring itself.\n\u201cSo what would you think,\u201d I asked, \u201cof having Maer Alveron for your patron?\u201d\nDenna stopped walking and turned to look at me. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m currently in his good graces,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd he owes me a favor or two. I know you\u2019ve been looking for a patron.\u201d\n\u201cI have a patron,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cOne I\u2019ve earned on my own.\u201d\n\u201cYou have half a patron,\u201d I protested. \u201cWhere\u2019s your writ of patronage? Your Master Ash might be able to give you some financial support, but the more important half of a patron is their name. It\u2019s like armor. It\u2019s like a key that opens\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI know how a patronage works,\u201d Denna said, cutting me off.\n\u201cThen you know yours is shortchanging you,\u201d I said. \u201cIf the Maer had been your patron when things went wrong at that wedding, no one in that shabby little town would have dared to raise their voice to you, let alone their hand. Even from a thousand miles away the Maer\u2019s name would have protected you. He would have kept you safe.\u201d\n\u201cA patron can offer more than a name and money,\u201d Denna said with an edge to her voice. \u201cI\u2019m fine without the shelter of a title, and honestly, I\u2019d be irritated if some man wanted to dress me in his colors. My patron gives me other things. He knows things I need to know.\u201d She gave me an irritated look as she flicked her hair over her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ve told you all this before. I\u2019m content with him for now.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not have both?\u201d I suggested. \u201cThe Maer in public and your Master Ash in secret. Surely he couldn\u2019t object to that. Alveron could probably even look into this other fellow for you, make sure he\u2019s not trying to win you with false\u2014\u201d\nDenna gave me a horrified look. \u201cNo. God no.\u201d She turned to me, her expression earnest. \u201cPromise me you won\u2019t try to find out anything about him. It could ruin everything. You\u2019re the only one I\u2019ve told in all the wide", "world, but he\u2019d be furious if he knew I\u2019d mentioned him to anyone.\u201d\nI felt a bizarre glow of pride at this. \u201cIf you\u2019d really rather I not . . .\u201d Denna stopped walking and set her harp case down on the cobblestones\nwhere it made a hollow thump. Her expression was deadly serious. \u201cPromise me.\u201d\nI probably wouldn\u2019t have agreed if I hadn\u2019t spent half the previous night following her around the city with the hope of discovering this very thing. But I had. Then I\u2019d eavesdropped on her, too. So today I was practically sweating with guilt.\n\u201cI promise,\u201d I said. When her anxious look didn\u2019t evaporate I added, \u201cDon\u2019t you trust me? I\u2019ll swear it, if that will set your mind at ease.\u201d\n\u201cWhat would you swear it on?\u201d she asked, beginning to smile again. \u201cWhat\u2019s important enough that it will hold you to your word?\u201d\n\u201cMy name and my power?\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou are many things,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cBut you are not Taborlin the Great.\u201d\n\u201cMy good right hand?\u201d I suggested.\n\u201cOnly one hand?\u201d she asked, playfulness creeping back into her tone. She reached out and took both of my hands in her own, turning them over and making a show of inspecting them closely. \u201cI like the left one better,\u201d she decided. \u201cSwear by that one.\u201d\n\u201cMy good left hand?\u201d I asked dubiously.\n\u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u201cThe right. You\u2019re such a traditionalist.\u201d\n\u201cI swear I won\u2019t attempt to uncover your patron,\u201d I said bitterly. \u201cI swear it\non my name and my power. I swear it by my good left hand. I swear it by the ever-moving moon.\u201d\nDenna peered at me closely, as if she wasn\u2019t sure if I was mocking her. \u201cFine,\u201d she said with a shrug, picking up her harp. \u201cConsider me reassured.\u201d\nWe started walking again, moving through the western gates and into the countryside. The silence between us stretched, starting to grow uncomfortable.\nWorried things would grow awkward, I said the first thing that came to mind. \u201cSo, are there any new men in your life?\u201d\nDenna chuckled low in her throat. \u201cNow you sound like Master Ash. He\u2019s always asking after them. He doesn\u2019t think any of my suitors are good enough for me.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t agree more, but decided it wouldn\u2019t be prudent to say so. \u201cAnd", "what does he think of me?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, confused. \u201cOh. He doesn\u2019t know about you,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhy would he?\u201d\nI tried to give a nonchalant shrug, but I couldn\u2019t have been very convincing\nas she burst out laughing. \u201cPoor Kvothe. I\u2019m teasing you. I only tell him about the ones that come prowling around, panting and sniffing like dogs. You\u2019re not like them. You\u2019ve always been different.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always prided myself on my lack of panting and sniffing.\u201d\nDenna turned her shoulder and let her swinging harp bump me playfully. \u201cYou know what I mean. They come and go with little gain or loss. You are the gold behind the windblown dross. Master Ash might think he has a right to know about my personal affairs, my comings and goings.\u201d She scowled a bit. \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m willing to concede some of that, for now. . . .\u201d\nShe reached out and took hold of my upper arm possessively. \u201cBut you are not part of the bargain,\u201d she said, her voice almost fierce. \u201cYou are mine. Mine alone. I don\u2019t intend to share you.\u201d\nThe momentary tension passed, and we walked the wide west road away from Severen, laughing and talking of small things. Half a mile past the city\u2019s last inn was a quiet patch of trees with a single tall greystone nestled in its center. We had found it while searching for wild strawberries, and it had become one of our favorite places to escape the noise and stink of the city.\nDenna sat at the base of the greystone and put her back against it. Then she brought her harp out of its case and pulled it close to her chest, causing her dress to gather and expose a scandalous amount of leg. She arched an eyebrow at me and smirked as if she knew exactly what I was thinking.\n\u201cNice harp,\u201d I said casually.\nShe snorted indelicately.\nI sat where I was, sprawling comfortably on the long, cool grass. I tugged a\nfew strands of it out of the ground and idly began to twist them together into a braid.\nHonestly, I was nervous. While we had spent a great deal of time together over the last month, I\u2019d never heard Denna play anything of her own creation. We had sung together, and I knew she had a voice like honey on warm bread. I knew her fingers were sure, and she had a musician\u2019s timing. . . .\nBut writing a song isn\u2019t the same as playing one. What if hers wasn\u2019t any good? What would I say?\nDenna spread her fingers to the strings, and my worries faded to the", "background. I\u2019ve always found something powerfully erotic about the way a woman puts her hands to a harp. She began a rolling gliss down the strings from high to low. The sound of it was like hammers on bells, like water over stones, like birdsong through the air.\nShe stopped and tuned a string. Plucked, tuned. She struck a sharp chord, a hard chord, a lingering chord, then turned to look at me, flexing her fingers nervously. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re incredible,\u201d I said.\nI saw her flush a little, then brush her hair back to hide her reaction. \u201cFool. I haven\u2019t played you anything yet.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re incredible all the same.\u201d\n\u201cHush.\u201d She struck a hard chord and let it fade into a quiet melody. As it rose and fell, she spoke the introduction to her song. I was surprised at such a traditional opening. Surprised but pleased. Old ways are best.\nGather round and listen well,\nFor I\u2019ve a tale of tragedy to tell.\nI sing of subtle shadow spread\nAcross a land, and of the man\nWho turned his hand toward a purpose few could bear. Fair Lanre: stripped of wife, of life, of pride\nStill never from his purpose swayed.\nWho fought the tide, and fell, and was betrayed.\nAt first it was her voice that caught my breath, then it was the music.\nBut before ten lines had passed her lips I was stunned for different reasons. She sang the story of Myr Tariniel\u2019s fall. Of Lanre\u2019s betrayal. It was the story I had heard from Skarpi in Tarbean.\nBut Denna\u2019s version was different. In her song, Lanre was painted in tragic tones, a hero wrongly used. Selitos\u2019 words were cruel and biting, Myr Tariniel a warren that was better for the purifying fire. Lanre was no traitor, but a fallen hero.\nSo much depends upon where you stop a story, and hers ended when Lanre was cursed by Selitos. It was the perfect ending for a tragedy. In her story Lanre was wronged, misunderstood. Selitos was a tyrant, an insane monster who tore out his own eye in fury at Lanre\u2019s clever trickery. It was dreadfully, painfully wrong.", "Despite this, it had the first glimmers of beauty to it. The chords well- chosen. The rhyme subtle and strong. The song was very fresh, and there were rough patches aplenty, but I could feel the shape of it. I saw what it could become. It would turn men\u2019s minds. They would sing it for a hundred years.\nYou\u2019ve probably heard it, in fact. Most folk have. She ended up calling it \u201cThe Song of Seven Sorrows.\u201d Yes. Denna composed it, and I was the first person to hear it played entire.\nAs the last notes faded in the air, Denna lowered her hands, unwilling to meet my eye.\nI sat, still and silent on the grass.\nFor this to make sense, you need to understand something every musician knows. Singing a new song is a nervous thing. More than that. It\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s like undressing for the first time in front of a new lover. It\u2019s a delicate moment.\nI needed to say something. A compliment. A comment. A joke. A lie. Anything was better than silence.\nBut I couldn\u2019t have been more stunned if she had written a hymn praising the Duke of Gibea. The shock was simply too much for me. I felt raw as reused parchment, as if every note of her song had been another flick of a knife, scraping until I was entirely blank and wordless.\nI looked down dumbly at my hands. They still held the half-formed circle of green grass I\u2019d been weaving when the song began. It was a broad, flat plait already beginning to curve into the shape of a ring.\nStill looking down, I heard the rustle of Denna\u2019s skirts as she moved. I needed to say something. I\u2019d already waited too long. There was too much silence in the air.\n\u201cThe city\u2019s name wasn\u2019t Mirinitel,\u201d I said without looking up. It was not the worst thing I could have said. But it wasn\u2019t the right thing to say.\nThere was a pause. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cNot Mirinitel,\u201d I repeated. \u201cThe city Lanre burned was Myr Tariniel. Sorry to tell you that. Changing a name is hard work. It will wreck the meter in a third of your verses.\u201d I was surprised at how quiet my voice was, how flat and dead it sounded in my own ears.\nI heard her draw a surprised breath. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard the story before?\u201d\nI looked up at Denna, her expression excited. I nodded, still feeling oddly blank. Empty. Hollow as a dried gourd. \u201cWhat made you pick this for a", "song?\u201d I asked her.\nIt wasn\u2019t the right thing to say either. I can\u2019t help but feel that if I\u2019d said\nthe right thing at that moment, everything would have turned out differently. But even now, after years of thinking, I can\u2019t imagine what I could have said that might have made things right.\nHer excitement faded slightly. \u201cI found a version of it in an old book when I was doing genealogical research for my patron,\u201d she said. \u201cHardly anyone remembers it, so it\u2019s perfect for a song. It\u2019s not like the world needs another story about Oren Velciter. I\u2019ll never make my mark repeating what other musicians have already hashed over a hundred times before.\u201d\nDenna gave me a curious look. \u201cI thought I was going to be able to surprise you with something new. I never would have guessed you\u2019d heard of Lanre.\u201d\n\u201cI heard it years ago,\u201d I said numbly. \u201cFrom an old storyteller in Tarbean.\u201d\n\u201cIf I had half your luck . . .\u201d Denna shook her head in dismay. \u201cI had to piece it together out of a hundred little scraps.\u201d She made a conciliatory gesture. \u201cMe and my patron, I should say. He\u2019s helped.\u201d\n\u201cYour patron,\u201d I said. I felt a spark of emotion when she mentioned him. Hollow as I was, it was surprising how quickly the bitterness spread through my gut, as if someone had kindled a fire inside me.\nDenna nodded. \u201cHe fancies himself a bit of a historian,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he\u2019s angling for a court appointment. He wouldn\u2019t be the first to ingratiate himself by shining a light on someone\u2019s long-lost heroic ancestor. Or maybe he\u2019s trying to invent a heroic ancestor for himself. That would explain the research we\u2019ve been doing in old genealogies.\u201d\nShe hesitated for a moment, biting her lips. \u201cThe truth is,\u201d she said, as if confessing something. \u201cI half suspect the song is for Alveron himself. Master Ash has implied he\u2019s had dealings with the Maer.\u201d She gave a mischievous grin. \u201cWho knows? Running in the circles you do, you might have already met my patron and not even known it.\u201d\nMy mind flickered over the hundreds of nobles and courtiers I\u2019d met in passing over the last month, but it was hard to focus on their faces. The fire in my gut was spreading until my whole chest was full of it.\n\u201cBut enough of this,\u201d Denna said, waving her hands impatiently. She pushed her harp away and folded her legs to sit cross-legged on the grass. \u201cYou\u2019re teasing me. What did you think of it?\u201d\nI looked down at my hands and idly fingered the flat braid of green grass", "I\u2019d woven. It was smooth and cool between my fingers. I couldn\u2019t remember how I\u2019d planned to join the ends together to form a ring.\n\u201cI know it\u2019s got some rough patches,\u201d I heard Denna say, her voice brimming with nervous excitement. \u201cI\u2019ll have to fix that name you mentioned, if you\u2019re sure it\u2019s the right one. The beginning is rough, and the seventh verse is a shambles, I know. I need to expand the battles and his relationship with Lyra. The ending needs tightening. But overall, what did you think?\u201d\nOnce she smoothed it out, it would be brilliant. As good a song as my parents might have written, but that just made it worse.\nMy hands were shaking, and I was amazed at how hard it was to make them stop. I looked away from them, up at Denna. Her nervous excitement faded when she saw my face.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to rework more than just the name.\u201d I tried to keep my voice calm. \u201cLanre wasn\u2019t a hero.\u201d\nShe looked at me oddly, as if she couldn\u2019t tell if I was making a joke. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the whole thing wrong,\u201d I said. \u201cLanre was a monster. A traitor. You need to change it.\u201d\nDenna tossed back her head and laughed. When I didn\u2019t join her, she cocked her head, puzzled. \u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d\nI nodded.\nDenna\u2019s face went stiff. Her eyes narrowed and her mouth made a thin line. \u201cYou have to be kidding.\u201d Her mouth worked silently for a moment, then she shook her head. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t make any sense. The whole story falls apart if Lanre isn\u2019t the hero.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about what makes a good story,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s about what\u2019s true.\u201d\n\u201cTrue?\u201d She looked at me incredulously. \u201cThis is just some old folk story. None of the places are real. None of the people are real. You might as well get offended at me for coming up with a new verse for \u2018Tinker Tanner.\u2019 \u201d\nI could feel words rising in my throat, hot as a chimney fire. I swallowed down hard against them. \u201cSome stories are just stories,\u201d I agreed. \u201cBut not this one. It\u2019s not your fault. There\u2019s no way you could have\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh well, thank you,\u201d she said bitingly. \u201cI\u2019m so glad this isn\u2019t my fault.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d I said sharply. \u201cIt is your fault. You should have done more research.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you know about the research I did?\u201d she demanded. \u201cYou", "haven\u2019t the slightest idea! I\u2019ve been all over the world digging up pieces of this story!\u201d\nIt was the same thing my father had done. He\u2019d started writing a song about Lanre, but his research led him to the Chandrian. He\u2019d spent years chasing down half-forgotten stories and digging up rumors. He wanted his song to tell the truth about them, and they had killed my entire troupe to put an end to it.\nI looked down at the grass and thought about the secret I had kept for so long. I thought of the smell of blood and burning hair. I thought of rust and blue fire and the broken bodies of my parents. How could I explain something so huge and horrible? Where would I even begin? I could feel the secret deep inside me, huge and heavy as a stone.\n\u201cIn the version of the story I heard,\u201d I said, touching the far edge of the secret. \u201cLanre became one of the Chandrian. You should be careful. Some stories are dangerous.\u201d\nDenna stared at me for a long moment. \u201cThe Chandrian?\u201d she said incredulously. Then she laughed. It was not her usual delighted laugh. This was sharp and full of derision. \u201cWhat kind of a child are you?\u201d\nI knew exactly how childish it made me sound. I felt myself flush hot with embarrassment, my whole body suddenly prickling with sweat. I opened my mouth to speak, and it felt like cracking open the door of a furnace.\u201cI\u2019m like a child?\u201d I spat. \u201cWhat do you know about anything, you stupid . . .\u201d I almost bit off the end of my tongue to keep from shouting the word whore.\n\u201cYou think you know everything, don\u2019t you?\u201d she demanded. \u201cYou\u2019ve been to the University so you think the rest of us are\u2014\u201d\n\u201cQuit looking for excuses to be upset and listen to me!\u201d I snapped. The words poured out of me like molten iron. \u201cYou\u2019re having a snit like a spoiled little girl!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d She jabbed a finger at me. \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me like I\u2019m some sort of witless farm girl. I know things they don\u2019t teach at your precious University! Secret things! I\u2019m not an idiot!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re acting like an idiot!\u201d I shouted so loudly the words hurt my throat. \u201cYou won\u2019t shut up long enough to listen to me! I\u2019m trying to help you!\u201d Denna sat in the center of a chilly silence. Her eyes were hard and flat.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s all about, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she said coldly. Her fingers moved in her hair, every flick of her fingers stiff with irritation. She untied her braids, smoothed them out, then absentmindedly retied them in a different pattern.", "\u201cYou hate that I won\u2019t take your help. You can\u2019t stand that I won\u2019t let you fix every little thing in my life, is that it?\u201d\n\u201cWell maybe someone needs to fix your life,\u201d I snapped. \u201cYou\u2019ve made a fair mess of it so far, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nShe continued to sit very still, her eyes furious. \u201cWhat makes you think you know anything about my life?\u201d\n\u201cI know you\u2019re so afraid of anyone getting close that you can\u2019t stay in the same bed four days in a row,\u201d I said, hardly knowing what I was saying anymore. Angry words poured out of me like blood from a wound. \u201cI know you live your whole life burning bridges behind you. I know you solve your problems by running\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat makes you think your advice is worth one thin sliver of a damn, anyway?\u201d Denna burst out. \u201cHalf a year ago you had one foot in the gutter. Hair all shaggy and only three raggedy shirts. There isn\u2019t a noble in a hundred miles of Imre that would piss on you if you were on fire. You had to run a thousand miles to have a chance of a patron.\u201d\nMy face burned with shame at her mention of my three shirts, and I felt my temper flare hot again. \u201cYou\u2019re right of course,\u201d I said scathingly. \u201cYou\u2019re much better off. I\u2019m sure your patron would be perfectly happy to piss on you \u2014\u201d\n\u201cNow we get to the heart of it,\u201d she said, throwing her hands up in the air. \u201cYou don\u2019t like my patron because you could get me a better one. You don\u2019t like my song because it\u2019s different from the one you know.\u201d She reached for her harp case, her movements stiff and angry. \u201cYou\u2019re just like all the rest.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to help you!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re trying to fix me,\u201d Denna said crisply as she put away her harp. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to buy me. To arrange my life. You want to keep me like I\u2019m your pet. Like I\u2019m your faithful dog.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d never think of you as a dog,\u201d I said, giving her a bright and brittle smile. \u201cA dog knows how to listen. A dog has sense enough not to bite a hand that\u2019s trying to help.\u201d\nOur conversation spiraled downward from there.\nAt this point in the story I\u2019m tempted to lie. To say I spoke these things in an\n \nuncontrollable rage. That I was overwhelmed with grief at the memory of my murdered family. I\u2019m tempted to say I tasted plum and nutmeg. Then I would have some excuse. . . .\nBut they were my words. In the end, I was the one who said those things. Only me.\nDenna responded in kind, hurt and furious and sharp-tongued as myself. We were both proud and angry and filled with the unshakable certainty of youth. We said things we never would have said otherwise, and when we left, we did not leave together.\nMy temper was hot and bitter as a bar of molten iron. It seared at me as I walked all the way back to Severen. It burned as I made my way through the city and waited for the freight lifts. It smoldered as I stalked through the Maer\u2019s estates and slammed the door to my rooms behind me.\nIt was only hours later that I cooled enough to regret my words. I thought of what I might have said to Denna. I thought of telling her of how my troupe was killed, about the Chandrian.\nI decided I would write her a letter. I would explain it all, no matter how foolish or unbelievable it seemed. I brought out pen and ink and laid a sheet of fine white paper on the writing desk.\nI dipped the pen and tried to think of where I could begin.\nMy parents had been killed when I was eleven. It was an event so huge and horrifying it had driven me nearly mad. In the years since, I had never told a soul of those events. I had never so much as whispered them in an empty room. It was a secret I had clutched so tightly for so long that when I dared think of it, it lay so heavy in my chest that I could barely breathe.\nI dipped the pen again, but no words came. I opened a bottle of wine, thinking it might loosen the secret inside me. Give me some fingerhold I could use to pry it up. I drank until the room spun and the nib of the pen was crusted with dry ink.\nHours later the blank sheet still stared at me, and I beat my fist against the desk in fury and frustration, striking it so hard my hand bled. That is how heavy a secret can become. It can make blood flow easier than ink.", ""], "CHAPTER SEVENTY-FOUR": ["CHAPTER SEVENTY-FOUR\nRumors\nTHE DAY AFTER I fought with Denna, I woke late in the afternoon, feeling miserable for all the obvious reasons. I ate and bathed, but pride kept me from heading down to Severen-Low to look for Denna. I sent a ring to Bredon, but the runner returned with the news that he was still away from the estate.\nSo I opened a bottle of wine and began to leaf through the pile of stories that had been slowly accumulating in my room. The majority of these were scandalous, spiteful things. But their petty meanness suited my mood and helped distract me from my own misery.\nThus I learned the previous Compte Banbride hadn\u2019t died of consumption, but of syphilis contracted from an amorous stable hand. Lord Veston was addicted to Denner resin, and money intended for the maintenance of the king\u2019s road was paying for his habit.\nBaron Jakis had paid several officials to avoid scandal when his youngest daughter was discovered in a brothel. There were two versions of that story, one where she was selling, and another where she was buying. I filed that information away for future use.\nI\u2019d started a second bottle of wine by the time I read that young Netalia Lackless had run away with a troupe of traveling performers. Her parents had disowned her, of course, leaving Meluan the only heir to the Lackless lands. That explained Meluan\u2019s hatred of the Ruh, and made me doubly glad I hadn\u2019t made my Edema blood public here in Severen.\nThere were three separate stories of how the Duke of Cormisant flew into rages while in his cups, beating whoever happened to be nearby, including his wife, his son, and several dinner guests. There was a brief speculative account of how the king and queen held depraved orgies in their private gardens, hidden from the eyes of the royal court.\nEven Bredon made an appearance. He was said to conduct pagan rituals in the secluded woods outside his northern estates. They were described with", "such extravagant and meticulous detail that I wondered if they weren\u2019t copied directly from the pages of some old Aturan romance.\nI read well into the evening, and was only halfway through the stack of stories when I finished the bottle of wine. I was just about to send a runner for another when I heard the soft hush of air from the other room that announced Alveron\u2019s entrance into my chambers through his secret passage.\nI pretended to look surprised when he entered the room. \u201cGood afternoon, your grace,\u201d I said as I came to my feet.\n\u201cSit if you wish,\u201d he said shortly.\nI remained standing out of deference, as I\u2019d learned it was better to err on the side of formality with the Maer. \u201cHow are things progressing with your lady?\u201d I asked. From Stapes\u2019 excited gossip, I knew matters were rapidly coming to a close.\n\u201cWe pledged a formal troth today,\u201d he said distractedly. \u201cSigned papers and all. It\u2019s done.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019ll forgive me for saying so, your grace, you don\u2019t seem very pleased.\u201d\nHe gave a sour smile. \u201cI suppose you\u2019ve heard about the trouble on the roads of late?\u201d\n\u201cOnly rumors, your grace.\u201d\nHe snorted. \u201cRumors I have been trying to keep quiet. Someone has been waylaying my tax collectors on the north road.\u201d\nThat was serious. \u201cCollectors, your grace?\u201d I asked, stressing the plural. \u201cHow much have they managed to take?\u201d\nThe Maer gave me a stern look that let me know the impropriety of my question. \u201cEnough. More than enough. This is the fourth I\u2019ve had go missing. Over half of my northern taxes taken by highwaymen.\u201d He gave me a serious look. \u201cThe Lackless lands are in the north, you know.\u201d\n\u201cYou think the Lacklesses are waylaying your collectors?\u201d\nHe gave me a stunned look. \u201cWhat? No, no. It\u2019s bandits in the Eld.\u201d I blushed a little in embarrassment. \u201cHave you sent out patrols, your\ngrace?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I\u2019ve sent out patrols,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI\u2019ve sent a dozen. They\nhaven\u2019t found so much as a campfire.\u201d He paused and looked at me. \u201cI suspect someone in my guard is in league with them.\u201d His expression was grave.\n\u201cI assume your grace has given your collectors escorts?\u201d", "\u201cTwo apiece,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you know how much it costs to replace a dozen guardsmen? Armor, weapons, horses?\u201d He sighed. \u201cOn top of it all, only part of the stolen taxes are mine, the rest belong to the king.\u201d\nI nodded an understanding. \u201cI don\u2019t imagine he\u2019s very pleased.\u201d\nAlveron waved a hand dismissively. \u201cOh, Roderic will have his money regardless. He holds me personally responsible for his tithe. So I am forced to send the collectors around again to gather his majesty\u2019s share a second time.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t imagine that sits very well with most people,\u201d I said.\n\u201cIt does not.\u201d He sat in an overstuffed chair and rubbed his face tiredly. \u201cI\u2019m at my wit\u2019s end over the matter. How will it look to Meluan if I cannot keep my own roads safe?\nI took a seat as well, facing him. \u201cWhat of Dagon?\u201d I asked. \u201cCouldn\u2019t he find them?\u201d\nAlveron gave a short, humorless bark of a laugh. \u201cOh, Dagon would find them. He\u2019d have their heads on poles inside ten days.\u201d\n\u201cThen why not send him?\u201d I asked, puzzled.\n\u201cBecause Dagon is a man of straight lines. He would raze a dozen villages and set fire to a thousand acres of the Eld to find them.\u201d He shook his head seriously. \u201cEven if I thought him suited to this task, he is tracking down Caudicus at the moment. Besides, I believe there may be magic at work in the Eld, and that is outside Dagon\u2019s ken.\u201d\nI suspected the only magic at work was half a dozen sturdy Modegan longbows. But it\u2019s the nature of people to cry magic whenever they\u2019re faced with something they cannot easily explain, especially in Vintas.\nAlveron leaned forward in his seat. \u201cMight I rely on your help in this?\u201d There was only one response to that. \u201cOf course, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know much woodcraft?\u201d\n\u201cI studied under a yeoman when I was younger,\u201d I exaggerated, guessing\nhe was looking for someone to help devise a better defense for his collectors. \u201cI know enough to track a man and hide myself.\u201d\nAlveron raised an eyebrow at that. \u201cReally? You are possessed of quite the diverse education, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve led an interesting life, your grace.\u201d The bottle of wine I\u2019d drunk made me bolder than usual, and I added. \u201cI\u2019ve got an idea or two you might find helpful in dealing with your bandit problem.\u201d\nHe leaned forward in his chair. \u201cDo tell.\u201d\n\u201cI could devise some arcane protection for your men.\u201d I made a flourish", "with the long fingers of my right hand, hoping it looked sufficiently mystical. I juggled numbers in my head and wondered how long it would take to create an arrowcatch using only the equipment in Caudicus\u2019 tower.\nAlveron nodded thoughtfully. \u201cThat might suffice if I was only concerned for the safety of my collectors. But this is the king\u2019s road, a major artery of trade. I need to be rid of the bandits themselves.\u201d\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d I said, \u201cI would assemble a small group who know how to make their way quietly in a forest. They shouldn\u2019t have too much difficulty locating your bandits. When they do, it should be a simple matter to send your guard out to catch them.\u201d\n\u201cEasier yet to set an ambush and kill them, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d Alveron said slowly, as if looking to gauge my reaction.\n\u201cOr that,\u201d I admitted. \u201cYour grace is the arm of the law.\u201d\n\u201cDeath is the penalty for banditry. Especially on the king\u2019s road,\u201d Alveron said firmly. \u201cDoes that seem harsh to you?\u201d\n\u201cNot in the least,\u201d I said, looking him squarely in the eye. \u201cSafe roads are the bones of civilization.\u201d\nAlveron surprised me with a sudden smile. \u201cYour plan is the very image of my own. I have gathered a handful of mercenaries to do just as you\u2019ve suggested. I\u2019ve had to move secretly, as I don\u2019t know who might be sending these bandits their warnings. But I\u2019ve got four good men ready to leave tomorrow: a tracker, two mercenaries with some skill in the forest, and an Adem mercenary. The last did not come cheaply, either.\u201d\nI gave him a congratulatory nod. \u201cYou\u2019ve already planned it better than I could, your grace. It hardly seems as if you need my help at all.\u201d\n\u201cQuite the contrary,\u201d he said. \u201cI still need someone with a little sense to lead them.\u201d He looked at me meaningfully. \u201cSomeone who understands magic. Someone I can trust.\u201d\nI felt a sudden sinking sensation.\nAlveron got to his feet, smiling warmly. \u201cTwice now you have served me beyond all expectations. Are you familiar with the expression \u2018third time pays for all\u2019?\u201d\nAgain, there was only one reasonable answer to that question. \u201cYes, your grace.\u201d\n \nAlveron took me to his rooms, and we looked over maps of the countryside where his men had been lost. It was a long stretch of the king\u2019s highway running through a piece of the Eld that had been old when Vintas was nothing more than a handful of squabbling sea kings. It was a little more than eighty miles away. We could be there in four days of hard walking.\nStapes provided me with a new travelsack, and I packed it as well as I was able. I took a few of the more practical clothes from my wardrobe, though they were still more suited for a ballroom than the road. I packed away a few items I\u2019d quietly pilfered from Caudicus\u2019 lab over the last span, and gave Stapes a list of a few essential items I was lacking, and he produced them all more quickly than a grocer in a store.\nFinally, at the hour when all but the most desperate and dishonest persons are abed, Alveron gave me a purse containing a hundred silver bits. \u201cThis is a messy way of handling it,\u201d Alveron said. \u201cNormally I would give you a writ charging citizens to provide you with assistance and aid.\u201d He sighed. \u201cBut using something like that as you travel would be as good as blowing a trumpet announcing your arrival.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cIf they\u2019re clever enough to have a spy among your guard, it\u2019s safe to assume they have connections with the local populace as well, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cThey might be the local populace,\u201d he said darkly.\nStapes led me out of the estate through the same secret passage the Maer used to enter my rooms. Carrying a hooded thief\u2019s lamp, he took me through several twisting passages, then down a long, dark stairway that bored deep into the stone of the Sheer.\nThus I found myself standing alone in the chill cellar of an abandoned shop in Severen-Low. It was in the section of the city that had been ravaged by fire some years ago, and the building\u2019s few remaining roof beams stretched like dark bones against the first pale light of dawn.\nI stepped from the burned shell of the building. Above, the Maer\u2019s estates perched on the edge of the Sheer like some predatory bird.\nI spat, none too pleased with my situation, press-ganged into mercenary service. My eyes were gritty from my sleepless night and my long journey through the twisting stone passages in the Sheer. The wine I\u2019d drunk wasn\u2019t improving anything either. For the last few hours I could feel myself growing less drunk and more hungover by slow degrees. I\u2019d never been awake", "through the entire process before, and it was not pleasant. I\u2019d managed to keep up appearances in front of Alveron and Stapes, but the fact of the matter was that my gut was sour and my thoughts were thick and sluggish.\nThe cool, predawn air cleared my head a little, and within a hundred steps I began thinking of things I\u2019d forgotten to include on the list I\u2019d given Stapes. The wine had done me no favors there. I had no tinderbox, no salt, no knife. . ..\nMy lute. I hadn\u2019t picked it up from the luthier after having its loose peg fixed. Who knew how long I might be hunting bandits for the Maer. How long would it sit unclaimed before the man decided it had been abandoned?\nI went two miles out of my way, but found the luthier\u2019s shop dark and lifeless. I hammered on the door to no avail. Then, after a moment\u2019s indecision, I broke in and stole it. Though it hardly seemed to be stealing, since the lute was mine to begin with, and I\u2019d already paid for the repairs.\nI had to climb a wall, force a window, and trip two locks. It was fairly simple stuff, but given my sleepless wine-sodden head, I\u2019m probably lucky I didn\u2019t fall off the roof and break my neck. But aside from a loose piece of slate that set my heart racing, things went smoothly and I was back on my way in twenty minutes.\nThe four mercenaries Alveron had assembled were waiting in a tavern two miles north of Severen. We made brief introductions and left immediately, heading north on the king\u2019s highway.\nMy thoughts were so sluggish that I was miles north of Severen before I began to reconsider a few things. Only then did it occur to me that the Maer might have been less than completely honest in everything he had told me the night before.\nWas I truly the best person to lead a handful of trackers into an unfamiliar forest to kill a band of highwaymen? Did the Maer really think so much of me?\nNo. Of course not. It was flattering, but simply not true. The Maer had access to better resources than that. The truth was, he probably wanted his sweet-tongued assistant out of the way now that he had the Lady Lackless well in hand. I was foolish for not realizing it sooner.\nSo he sent me on a fool\u2019s errand to get me out from underfoot. He expected me to spend a month chasing his wild goose in the deep forest of the Eld then come back empty-handed. The purse made better sense, too. A hundred bits would keep us provisioned for a month or so. Then, when I ran", "out of money I\u2019d be forced to return to Severen where the Maer would cluck his tongue in disappointment and use my failure as an excuse to ignore some of the favor I\u2019d accumulated so far.\nOn the other hand, if I got lucky and found the bandits, all the better. It was exactly the sort of plan I\u2019d credit to the Maer. No matter what happened, he got something he wanted.\nIt was irritating. But I could hardly go back to Severen and confront him. Now that I\u2019d committed myself, there was nothing to do but make the best of the situation.\nAs I walked north, my head throbbing and my mouth gritty, I decided I would surprise the Maer again. I\u2019d hunt down his bandits.\nThen third time would pay for all, and Maer Alveron would be well and truly in my debt.", ""], "CHAPTER SEVENTY-FIVE": ["CHAPTER SEVENTY-FIVE\nThe Players\nOVER THE NEXT FEW hours of walking, I did my best to get to know the men Alveron had saddled me with. I speak figuratively, of course, as one of them was a woman, and we were all five of us afoot.\nTempi caught my eye first and held it the longest, as he was the first Adem mercenary I\u2019d ever met. Far from being the imposing, hard-eyed killer I\u2019d expected, Tempi was rather nondescript, neither particularly tall nor heavily built. He was fair-skinned with light hair and pale grey eyes. His expression was blank as fresh paper. Strangely blank. Studiously blank.\nI knew Adem mercenaries wore blood-red clothing as a sort of badge. But Tempi\u2019s outfit was different than I\u2019d expected. His shirt was held tight against his body with a dozen soft leather straps. His pants, too, were belted tightly at the thigh and calf and knee. Everything was dyed the same bright and bloody red, and it fit him snugly as a gentleman\u2019s glove.\nAs the day grew warm, I saw him begin to sweat. After living in the cool, thin air of the Stormwal, the weather must have seemed disproportionately hot to him. An hour before noon, he loosened the leather straps of his shirt and peeled it away, using it to wipe the sweat from his face and arms. He didn\u2019t seem even slightly self-conscious about walking the king\u2019s highway naked to the waist.\nTempi\u2019s skin was so pale it was almost the color of cream, and his body was lean and sleek as a coursing hound, his muscles shifting under his skin with an animal grace. I tried not to stare, but my eyes couldn\u2019t help but pick out the thin, pale scars that crossed his arms and chest and back.\nHe never offered a word of complaint about the heat. Words of any sort seemed rare from him, and he responded to most questions with a nod or a shake of the head. He carried a travelsack like mine, and his sword, far from being intimidating, seemed rather short and unimpressive.\nDedan was as different from Tempi as one man can be from another. He was tall, wide, and thick around the chest and neck. He carried a heavy", "sword, a long knife, and wore a mismatched set of boiled leather armor, hard enough to knock on and often mended. If you have ever seen a caravan guard, then you have seen Dedan, or at least someone cut from the same bolt of cloth.\nHe ate most, complained most, swore most, and had a stubborn streak thicker than a broad oak plank. But to be fair, he also had a friendly manner and an easy laugh. I was tempted to think of him as stupid due to his manners and his size, but Dedan had a quick wit when he bothered using it.\nHespe was a female mercenary. Not as rare a creature as some folk think. In appearance and equipage she was a near-mirror of Dedan. The leather, the heavy sword, the slightly weatherworn and world-wise attitude. She had broad shoulders, strong hands, and a proud face with a jaw like a cinder- brick. Her hair was blonde and fine, but cut short, in the fashion of a man\u2019s.\nBut to see her as a female version of Dedan was a mistake. She was reserved where Dedan was all bravado. And while Dedan had an easy manner when his temper wasn\u2019t up, Hespe had a vague hardness about her, as if she were constantly expecting someone to give her trouble.\nMarten was the oldest of us, our tracker. He wore a little leather, softer and better cared for than Dedan\u2019s or Hespe\u2019s. He carried a long knife, a short knife, and a hunter\u2019s bow.\nMarten had worked as a huntsman before falling out of favor with the baronet whose forests he had tended. Mercenary work was a poor job by comparison, but it kept him fed. His skill with a bow made him valuable despite the fact that he wasn\u2019t nearly as physically imposing as either Dedan or Hespe.\nThe three of them had formed a loose partnership some months ago and had been selling their services as a group ever since. Marten told me they\u2019d done other jobs for the Maer, the most recent of which involved scouting some of the lands around Tinu\u00eb.\nIt took me about ten minutes to realize Marten should be the leader of this expedition. He had more woodcraft than all the rest of us put together and had even hunted men for bounty once or twice. When I mentioned this to him, he shook his head and smiled, telling me that being able to do something and wanting to do it were two very different things indeed.\nLast was me: their fearless leader. The Maer\u2019s letter of introduction had described me as, \u201ca discerning young man of good education and diverse useful qualities.\u201d While this was perfectly true, it also made me sound like", "the most wretchedly useless court dandy in existence.\nNot helping matters was the fact that I was younger than any of them by\nyears and wearing clothes more suited for a dinner party than the road. I carried my lute and the Maer\u2019s purse. I wore no sword, no armor, no knife.\nI daresay they didn\u2019t quite know what to make of me.\nThe sun was about an hour from setting when we passed a tinker on the road. He wore the traditional brown robe, belted with a length of rope. He didn\u2019t have a cart, but led a single donkey so loaded with bundles of oddments that it looked like a mushroom.\nHe made his slow way toward us, singing:\nIf you need no mending, and nothing needs tending A wise man will still see the right time for spending. Enjoy the sunshine,\nBut though you might feel fine,\nIf you don\u2019t stop now, you\u2019ll be filled with regret. It\u2019s better to simply pay,\nAnd prepare for a rainy day\nThan think of the tinker when you\u2019re dripping wet.\nI laughed and applauded. Proper traveling tinkers are a rare breed of people, and I am always glad to see one. My mother told me they were lucky, and my father had valued them for their news. The fact that I was in desperate need of a few items made this meeting three times welcome.\n\u201cHo, Tinker,\u201d Dedan said, smiling. \u201cI need fire and a pint. How long before we hit an inn?\u201d\nThe tinker pointed back the way he had come. \u201cNot twenty minutes\u2019 walk.\u201d He eyed Dedan. \u201cBut you can\u2019t tell me there\u2019s nothing you need,\u201d he admonished. \u201cEveryone needs something.\u201d\nDedan shook his head politely. \u201cI beg your pardon, Tinker. My purse is too thin.\u201d\n\u201cHow about you?\u201d The tinker eyed me up and down. \u201cYou\u2019ve the look of a lad who\u2019s wanting something.\u201d\n \n\u201cI do need a few things,\u201d I admitted. Seeing the others look longingly down the road, I motioned them on. \u201cGo ahead,\u201d I told them. \u201cI\u2019ll be a few minutes.\u201d\nAs they headed off, the tinker rubbed his hands together, grinning. \u201cWell now, what is it you\u2019re looking for?\u201d\n\u201cSome salt to begin with.\u201d\n\u201cAnd a box to put it in,\u201d he said as he began to rummage around in his donkey\u2019s packs.\n\u201cI could use a knife too, if you have one that\u2019s not too hard to come by.\u201d\n\u201cEspecially if you\u2019re heading north,\u201d he said without missing a beat. \u201cDangerous road that way. Wouldn\u2019t do to be without a knife.\u201d\n\u201cDid you have any trouble?\u201d I asked, hoping he might know something that could help us find the bandits.\n\u201cOh no,\u201d he said as he dug through his packs. \u201cThings aren\u2019t so bad that anyone would dream of laying hands on a tinker. Still, it\u2019s a bad stretch of road.\u201d He produced a long, narrow knife in a leather sheath and handed it to me. \u201cRamston steel.\u201d\nI drew it out of its sheath, and gave the blade a close look. It was Ramston steel. \u201cI don\u2019t need anything that fine,\u201d I said, handing it back. \u201cI\u2019ll be putting it to everyday use, eating mostly.\u201d\n\u201cRamston\u2019s fine for everyday use,\u201d the tinker said pushing it back into my hands. \u201cYou can use it to trim kindling, then shave with it if you like. Keeps an edge forever.\u201d\n\u201cI might have to put it to hard use,\u201d I clarified. \u201cAnd Ramston\u2019s brittle.\u201d\n\u201cThere is that,\u201d the tinker admitted easily. \u201cAs my father always used to say, \u2018the best knife you\u2019ll ever have until it breaks.\u2019 But the same could be said of any knife. And truth be told, that\u2019s the only knife I have.\u201d\nI sighed. I know when I\u2019m being skinned. \u201cAnd a tinderbox.\u201d\nHe held one out almost before I finished saying it. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but notice you\u2019ve got a little ink about the fingers.\u201d He gestured at my hands. \u201cI\u2019ve got some paper here, good quality. Pen and ink too. Nothing worse than having an idea for a song and not being able to write it down.\u201d He held out a leather parcel of paper, pens, and ink.\nI shook my head, knowing that the Maer\u2019s purse would only stretch so far. \u201cI think I\u2019m done with song writing for a while, Tinker.\u201d\nHe shrugged, still holding it out. \u201cLetter writing then. I know a fellow who had to open a vein once to write a note to his ladylove. Dramatic, true.", "Symbolic, certainly. But also painful, unsanitary, and more than slightly macabre. Now he carries pen and ink with him wherever he goes.\u201d\nI felt the color drain from my face as the tinker\u2019s words reminded me of something else I\u2019d forgotten in my rush to leave Severen: Denna. All thought of her had been forced out of my mind by the Maer\u2019s talk of bandits, two bottles of strong wine, and a night with no sleep. I had left without a word after our terrible fight. What would she think if I spoke so cruelly to her, then simply disappeared?\nI was already a full day\u2019s journey from Severen. I couldn\u2019t go back just to tell her I was leaving, could I? I considered it for a moment. No. Besides, Denna herself had disappeared for days without a word of warning. Surely she would understand if I did the same. . . .\nStupid. Stupid. Stupid. My thoughts spun in circles as I tried to decide among my several unpleasant options.\nThe harsh hee haa of the tinker\u2019s donkey startled a thought into me. \u201cAre you headed to Severen, Tinker?\u201d\n\u201cMore through than to,\u201d he said. \u201cBut yes.\u201d\n\u201cI just remembered a letter I need to send. If I gave it to you, could you deliver it to a certain inn?\u201d\nHe nodded slowly. \u201cI could,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven that you\u2019ll be needing paper and ink. . . .\u201d He smiled, waving the package again.\nI grimaced. \u201cI will, Tinker. But how much will the lot of this cost me?\u201d\nHe looked at the accumulated items. \u201cSalt and box: four bits. Knife: fifteen bits. Paper, pens, and ink: eighteen bits. Tinderbox: three bits.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the delivery,\u201d I said.\n\u201cAn urgent delivery,\u201d the tinker said with a bit of a smile. \u201cTo a lady, unless I mistake the look on your face.\u201d\nI nodded.\n\u201cRight,\u201d he rubbed his chin. \u201cOrdinarily, I\u2019d push for about thirty-five then have a nice leisurely dicker where you bargain me down to thirty.\u201d\nThe price was reasonable, especially considering how hard it was to find good paper. Still, it was a full third of the money the Maer had given me. We would need that money for food, lodging, and other supplies.\nBut before I could say anything, the tinker continued. \u201cNow I can tell that\u2019s too much for your comfort,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I hope you don\u2019t think me too forward in saying this, but that is a rather fine cloak you\u2019re wearing. I\u2019m always willing to make a fellow a trade.\u201d", "I pulled my lovely burgundy cloak around me self-consciously. \u201cI suppose I\u2019d be willing to give it up,\u201d I said, not having to fake the regret in my voice. \u201cBut that will leave me with no cloak at all. What will I do when it rains?\u201d\n\u201cNo trouble there,\u201d the tinker said. He pulled a bundle of cloth out of a pack and held it up for me to see. It had been black once upon a time, but long use and many washings had faded it to a dark greenish color.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little tatty,\u201d I said, reaching out to finger a fraying seam.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just broken in, that\u2019s all,\u201d he said easily, spreading it across my shoulders. \u201cGood fit. Good color for you, brings out your eyes. Besides, you don\u2019t want to be looking too well-off, what with those bandits on the road.\u201d\nI sighed. \u201cWhat will you give me in trade?\u201d I asked, handing my beautiful cloak over to him. \u201cThat cloak\u2019s not a month old, mind you, and it\u2019s never even seen a drop of rain.\u201d\nThe tinker ran his hands over my beautiful cloak. \u201cIt\u2019s got all sorts of little pockets!\u201d he said admiringly. \u201cThat\u2019s just lovely!\u201d\nI fingered the thinning cloth of the tinker\u2019s cloak. \u201cIf you\u2019ll throw in needle and thread, I\u2019ll trade you my cloak for the lot of it,\u201d I said with sudden inspiration. \u201cPlus I\u2019ll give you an iron penny, a copper penny, and a silver penny.\u201d\nI grinned. It was a pittance. But that\u2019s what tinkers in stories ask for when they trade some fabulous piece of magic to an unsuspecting widow\u2019s son when he\u2019s off to make his fortune in the world.\nThe tinker threw his head back and laughed. \u201cI was about to suggest that very thing,\u201d he said. Then he tossed my cloak over his arm and shook my hand firmly.\nI fished around in my purse and handed over an iron drab, two Vintish half-pennies, and, much to my pleasant surprise, an Aturan hard penny. The last was lucky for me as it was only worth a fraction of a Vintish silver round. I emptied the dozen pockets of my burgundy cloak into my travelsack and collected my new possessions from the tinker.\nThen I wrote a quick letter to Denna, explaining that my patron had sent me away unexpectedly. I apologized for the rash things I\u2019d said, and told her I would meet with her as soon as I was back in Severen. I would have liked more time to compose it. I would have liked to give a more subtle apology, a more detailed explanation, but the tinker had finished packing away my beautiful cloak and was obviously eager to be on his way again.\nNot having any sealing wax to secure the letter, I used a trick I\u2019d invented", "while writing notes on the Maer\u2019s behalf. I folded the piece of paper against itself, then tucked it together in such a way that it would be necessary to tear the paper in order to unfold it again.\nI handed it to the tinker. \u201cIt goes to a pretty, dark-haired woman by the name of Denna. She\u2019s staying at the Four Tapers in Severen-Low.\u201d\n\u201cThat reminds me,\u201d he exclaimed as he tucked my letter into a pocket. \u201cCandles.\u201d He reached into a saddlebag and pulled out a handful of fat tallow tapers. \u201cEveryone needs candles.\u201d\nFunny thing was, I could use some, though not for the reasons he thought.\n\u201cI\u2019ve also got some rubbing wax for your boots,\u201d he continued, rooting through his bundles. \u201cWe get fierce rain this time of year.\u201d\nI held up my hands, laughing. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a bit for four candles, but I can\u2019t afford any more. If this keeps up I\u2019ll have to buy your donkey just to carry the lot with me.\u201d\n\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d he said with an easy shrug. \u201cPleasure doing business with you, young sir.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER SEVENTY-SIX": ["CHAPTER SEVENTY-SIX\nTinder\nTHE SUN WAS STARTING to set by the time we found a good place to camp on the second night. Dedan went foraging for firewood. Marten began cutting up carrots and potatoes and sent Hespe to fill the cookpot with water. I used Marten\u2019s small spade to dig a pit for our fire.\nWithout being asked, Tempi picked up a branch and used his sword to shave thin strips of dry wood to use for tinder. Unsheathed, his sword still didn\u2019t seem terribly impressive. But given how easily it was peeling away paper-thin strips of wood, it must have been sharp as a shaving razor.\nI finished lining the pit with stones. Wordlessly, Tempi handed me a handful of tinder.\nI nodded. \u201cWould you like to use my knife?\u201d I asked, hoping to draw him into a bit of a conversation. I\u2019d barely shared a dozen words with him in the last two days.\nTempi\u2019s pale grey eyes looked at the knife on my belt, then back at his sword. He shook his head, fidgeting nervously.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it bad for the edge?\u201d I asked.\nThe mercenary shrugged, avoiding my eye.\nI began to lay the fire, and that was when I made my first mistake.\nAs I\u2019ve said, there was a chill in the air, and we were all of us tired. So\nrather than spend half an hour slowly nursing a spark into a decent campfire, I arranged twigs around Tempi\u2019s tinder, then stacked progressively bigger sticks around it, making a tightly packed cluster of wood.\nDedan returned with another armload of firewood just as I was finishing. \u201cLovely,\u201d he groused, quiet enough he could pretend he was just talking to himself, but loud enough so everyone could hear. \u201cAnd you\u2019re in charge. Wonderful.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s stuck in your teeth now?\u201d Marten asked, tiredly.\n\u201cBoy\u2019s making a little wooden fort, not a fire.\u201d Dedan sighed dramatically, then assumed a tone he probably thought was fatherly, but came across as", "profoundly condescending. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll help you out. A spark will never catch on that. Do you have flint and steel? I\u2019ll show you how to use them.\u201d\nNo one enjoys being talked down to, but I have a particular aversion to it. Dedan had been making it clear for two days that he thought I was an idiot.\nI gave a tired sigh. My oldest, most world-weary sigh. That was how I needed to play it. He thought of me as young and useless. I needed to drive home the point that I was nothing of the sort. \u201cDedan,\u201d I asked, \u201cwhat do you know about me?\u201d\nHe gave me a blank look.\n\u201cYou know one thing about me,\u201d I said calmly. \u201cYou know the Maer put me in charge.\u201d I looked him in the eye. \u201cIs the Maer an idiot?\u201d\nDedan made a dismissive gesture. \u201cOf course not, I was just sayin\u2019. . .\u201d\nI stood up and regretted it, as it just brought into sharp contrast how much taller he was. \u201cWould the Maer have put me in charge if I were an idiot?\u201d\nHe gave an insincere smile, trying to pass off two days\u2019 worth of derogatory muttering as some sort of misunderstanding. \u201cNow don\u2019t get all twisted up over\u2014\u201d\nI held up my hand. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault. You just don\u2019t know anything about me. But let\u2019s not waste time on it tonight. We\u2019re all tired. For now, rest assured that I\u2019m not some rich tit\u2019s son, out for a lark.\u201d\nI pinched a thin piece of Tempi\u2019s tinder between my fingers and concentrated. I pulled more heat than I needed and felt my arm go chilly all the way to the shoulder. \u201cAnd rest assured I know how to start a fire.\u201d\nThe shaved pieces of wood caught fire, flaring up hot and sudden, catching the rest of the tinder and making flames leap up almost instantly.\nI\u2019d meant it to be a dramatic gesture so Dedan would stop thinking of me as some useless boy. But the time I spent at the University had made me jaded. Starting a fire like this was as simple as putting on your boots for a member of the Arcanum.\nDedan, on the other hand, had never met an arcanist, and probably hadn\u2019t ever been within five hundred miles of the University. Everything he knew about magic was from campfire stories.\nSo when the fire flared up, he went pale as a sheet and took several sudden steps back. He looked for all the world as if I\u2019d suddenly called up a roaring sheet of fire like Taborlin the Great.\nThen I saw Marten and Hespe wearing the same expression, native Vintish superstition written clearly on their faces. Their eyes went to the flickering", "fire, then back to me. I was one of those. I meddled with dark powers. I summoned demons. I ate the entire little cheese, including the rind.\nLooking at their stunned faces, I realized nothing I said would set them at ease. Not right now. So instead I sighed and began to set up my sleeping roll for the night.\nWhile there wasn\u2019t much cheerful conversation around the fire that night, there wasn\u2019t any muttering from Dedan either. I\u2019d like respect, but failing that, a little healthy fear can go a long way to making things run smoothly.\nTwo days with no further dramatics on my part helped everyone relax. Dedan was still all bluff and bravado, but he had quit calling me \u201cboy\u201d and was only complaining about half as much, so I considered it a victory.\nFlushed with this lukewarm success, I decided to make an active attempt to draw Tempi into a conversation. If I was going to be in charge of this little group, I needed to know more about him. Most importantly, I needed to know if he could speak more than five words in a row.\nSo I approached the Adem mercenary when we stopped for our midday meal. He was sitting slightly apart from the rest of us. He wasn\u2019t standoffish. It\u2019s just that the rest of us would sit and talk while we ate. Tempi, on the other hand, simply ate.\nBut today I made a point of sitting down next to him with my lunch: a chunk of hard sausage and some cold potatoes. \u201cHello, Tempi.\u201d\nHe looked up and nodded. For a second I caught a glimpse of his pale grey eyes. Then he looked away, shifting restlessly. He ran his hand through his hair, and for a second he reminded me of Simmon. They both had the same slender build and sandy hair. Simmon wasn\u2019t this quiet though. Sometimes I could barely get a word in edgewise with Sim.\nI\u2019d tried to talk to Tempi before, of course. Ordinary small talk: the weather, sore feet after a long day\u2019s walk, the food. These had all come to nothing. At best a word or two. More often a nod or a shrug. But most common was a blank look followed by fidgeting and a stubborn refusal to do so much as look me in the eye.\nSo today I had a conversational gambit. \u201cI have heard stories about the Lethani,\u201d I said. \u201cI would like to know more. Would you tell me about it?\u201d\n \nTempi\u2019s pale eyes touched mine briefly, his expression still blank. Then he looked away again. He tugged one of the red leather straps that held his shirt close to his body and fidgeted with his sleeve. \u201cNo. I will not speak on Lethani. It is not for you. Do not ask.\u201d\nHe looked away from me again, down at the ground.\nI counted in my head. Sixteen words. That answered one of my questions at least.", ""], "CHAPTER SEVENTY-SEVEN": ["CHAPTER SEVENTY-SEVEN\nPennysworth\nTWILIGHT WAS SETTLING IN as we rounded a curve in the road. I heard clapping and stomping mingled with music, shouting, and roars of laughter. After ten hours of walking, the sound lifted my spirits to an almost cheerful level.\nLocated at the last major crossroad south of the Eld, the Pennysworth Inn was enormous. Built of rough-hewn timber, it had two full stories and a scattering of gables that hinted at a smaller, third floor above that. Through the windows I caught glimpses of men and women dancing while an unseen fiddler sawed out a mad and breathless tune.\nDedan took a deep breath. \u201cCan you smell that? I tell you, there\u2019s a woman in this place could cook a stone and make me beg for more. Sweet Peg. By these hands, I hope she\u2019s still around.\u201d He made a curving gesture, showing the double meaning of his words as he nudged Marten with an elbow.\nHespe\u2019s eyes narrowed as she stared at the back of Dedan\u2019s head.\nOblivious, Dedan continued, \u201cTonight I\u2019ll sleep with a bellyful of lamb and brandy. Although a little less sleeping might prove a little more entertaining, if my last trip here was any indication.\u201d\nI saw the storm brewing on Hespe\u2019s face and spoke up quickly. \u201cWhatever\u2019s in the pot and a bunk for each of us,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cAnything else comes out of your own pocket.\u201d\nDedan looked as if he couldn\u2019t quite believe his ears. \u201cCome off it. We\u2019ve been sleeping rough for days. Besides, \u2019taint your money, don\u2019t be a stingy shim with it.\u201d\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t done our job yet,\u201d I said calmly. \u201cNot even a piece of it. I don\u2019t know how long we may be out here, but I know I\u2019m not rich. If we run through the Maer\u2019s purse too quickly we\u2019re going to have to hunt for what we eat.\u201d I looked around at everyone. \u201cUnless someone else has enough coin to keep us fed and cares to share?\u201d\nMarten smiled ruefully at the suggestion. Hespe\u2019s eyes were for Dedan,", "who continued glowering in my direction.\nTempi fidgeted, his expression unreadable as ever. Avoiding my eyes, he\nglanced at everyone in turn, his expression blank. His eyes moved, not from face to face, but at Dedan\u2019s hands, then Dedan\u2019s feet. Then Marten\u2019s feet, then Hespe\u2019s, then mine. He shifted his weight and moved a half-step closer to Dedan.\nHoping to dispel the tension, I softened my tone and said, \u201cAfter everything is done we\u2019ll split what\u2019s left of the purse. That way each of us will have a little extra in our pocket before we even get back to Severen. We can each spend our lots as we want to. Then.\u201d\nI could tell Dedan wasn\u2019t pleased and waited to see if he would press the point.\nInstead it was Marten who spoke up. \u201cAfter a day of long walking,\u201d he said in a musing voice, as if talking to himself. \u201cA drink would go down nice.\u201d\nDedan looked to his friend, then back to me expectantly.\n\u201cI think the purse can stand a round of drinks,\u201d I conceded with a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Maer is trying to make priests of us, do you?\u201d\nThis got a throaty laugh from Hespe, while Marten and Dedan cracked smiles. Tempi glanced at me with his pale eyes, fidgeted, and looked away.\nA few minutes of relaxed haggling got the five of us common bunks, a simple supper, and a round of drinks for a single silver bit. After that was done, I found a table in a quieter corner of the room and tucked my lute out of harm\u2019s way under my bench. Then I sat down, bone weary and wondering what I could do to get Dedan to stop acting like such a little swaggercock.\nSuch was the distracted turning of my thoughts when my dinner thumped onto the table in front of me. I looked up to see a woman\u2019s face and well- advertised bosom framed by a tumble of bright red curls. Her skin was white as cream with just the barest hint of freckle. Her lips a pale, dangerous pink. Her eyes a bright, dangerous green.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, somewhat belatedly.\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, love.\u201d She smiled playfully with her eyes and brushed her hair back from her bare shoulder. \u201cIt looked like you were almost a-\n \nsleeping in your seat.\u201d\n\u201cI nearly was. A long day and a long road.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a shame indeed,\u201d she said with playful regret as she rubbed the\nback of her neck. \u201cIf I thought you\u2019d still be on your feet in an hour, I\u2019d take you off them.\u201d She reached out and twined her fingers lightly through the hair on the back of my head. \u201cThe two of us would be enough to start a fire.\u201d\nI froze like a startled deer. I cannot say why, except perhaps that I was tired from several days on the road. Perhaps it was that I\u2019d never been approached in such a forthright manner before. Perhaps\u2014\nPerhaps I was young and woefully inexperienced. Let us leave it at that.\nI scrambled desperately for something to say, but by the time I found my tongue she\u2019d taken a half step away and given me a shrewd look. I felt my face grow hot, embarrassing me further. Without thinking, I looked down at the table and the dinner she\u2019d brought. Potato soup, I thought numbly.\nShe gave a small, quiet laugh and touched my shoulder kindly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry lad. You looked like you were a little more\u2014\u201d She broke off, as if reconsidering her words, then started again. \u201cI liked the fresh look of you, but I didn\u2019t think you were that young.\u201d\nThough she spoke gently, I could hear the smile in her voice. It made my face burn even hotter, all the way to my ears. Finally, seeming to realize that anything she said would just embarrass me further, she took her hand off my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll be back to see if you need anything later.\u201d\nI nodded dumbly and watched her go. Her retreat was pleasing, but I was distracted by the sounds of scattered laughter. I looked around to see amusement on the faces of the men sitting at the long tables around me. One group raised their mugs in a silent, mocking salute. Another fellow leaned over to pat my back consolingly, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t take it personal, boy, she\u2019s turned all of us away.\u201d\nFeeling as if everyone in the room was watching me, I kept my eyes low and began to eat my dinner. As I tore off pieces of bread and dipped them in my soup, I composed a mental catalog of the extent of my idiocy. Surreptitiously, I watched the red-haired serving girl entertain and rebuff the ploys of a dozen men as she carried drinks from table to table.\nI had regained a bit of my composure by the time Marten slid into a chair next to me. \u201cYou did a good job with Dedan out there,\u201d he said without preamble.\nMy spirits lifted a bit. \u201cDid I?\u201d", "Marten nodded slightly as his sharp eyes wandered over the crowd that filled the room. \u201cMost folk try to bully him, make him feel stupid. He\u2019d have paid you back ten times the trouble if you\u2019d done it that way.\u201d\n\u201cHe was being stupid,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cAnd when you come right down to it, I did bully him.\u201d\nIt was his turn to shrug. \u201cBut you did it smart, so he\u2019ll still listen to you.\u201d He took a drink and paused, changing the subject. \u201cHespe offered to share a room with him tonight,\u201d he said casually.\n\u201cReally?\u201d I said, more than slightly surprised. \u201cShe\u2019s getting bolder.\u201d He gave a slow nod.\n\u201cAnd?\u201d I prompted.\n\u201cAnd nothing. Dedan said he\u2019d be damned before he spent money on a\nroom he should have for free.\u201d He slid his eyes to me and raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re not serious,\u201d I said flatly. \u201cHe has to know. He\u2019s just playing the\nsimpleton because he doesn\u2019t like her.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Marten said, turning toward me and lowering his voice a\nbit. \u201cThree span ago we finished a caravan job from Ralien. It was a long haul, and Dedan and me had a pocket full of coin and nothing in particular to do with it, so by the end of the night we\u2019re sitting in this grubby little dockside tavern, too drunk to stand up and leave. And he starts talking about her.\u201d\nMarten shook his head slowly. \u201cHe went on for an hour, and you wouldn\u2019t have recognized the woman he was describing as our hard-eyed Hespe. He practically sang about her.\u201d He sighed. \u201cHe thinks she\u2019s too good for him. And he\u2019s convinced if he so much as looked at her sideways he\u2019d end up with his arm broken in three places.\u201d\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell him?\u201d\n\u201cTell him what? That was before she started going all cow-eyed over him. I thought his worries were fairly sensible at the time. What do you think Hespe would do to you if you were to give her a friendly pat on any of her friendlier parts?\u201d\nI looked over to where Hespe stood at the bar. One foot tapped roughly in time to the rhythm of the fiddle. Other than that, the set of her shoulders, her eyes, the line of her jaw were all hard, almost belligerent. There was a small but noticeable gap between her and the men standing on either side of her at the bar.\n\u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t risk my arm either,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut he has to know", "by now. He isn\u2019t blind.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s no worse off than the rest of us.\u201d\nI started to protest, then glanced at the red-haired serving girl. \u201cWe could\ntell him,\u201d I said. \u201cYou could. He trusts you.\u201d\nMarten sucked at his teeth with his tongue. \u201cNah,\u201d he said, setting his\ndrink down firmly. \u201cIt would just make things muddier. Either he\u2019ll see it or he won\u2019t. In his own time, in his own way.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cOr not, and the sun will still rise in the morning.\u201d\nNeither of us spoke for a long while. Marten watched the buzzing room over the top of his mug, his eyes growing distant. I let the noise of the place fade to a low comforting purr as I leaned against the wall, drowsing.\nAnd as my thoughts untended tend to do, they wandered to Denna. I thought about the smell of her, the arch of her neck near her ear, the way her hands moved when she talked. I wondered where she was tonight, if she was well. I wondered just a bit if her thoughts ever wandered into warm musings of me. . . .\n\u201c. . . hunting bandits shouldn\u2019t be hard. Besides, it\u2019ll be nice to get the jump on them for a change, lawless damn ravel bastards.\u201d\nThe words drew me out of my warm drowse like a fish yanked from a pool. The fiddler had stopped playing to have a drink, and in the relative quiet of the room Dedan\u2019s voice was loud as a donkey\u2019s bray. I opened my eyes and saw Marten was looking around in mild alarm too, no doubt roused by the same words that had caught my ear.\nIt only took me a second to spot Dedan. He was sitting two tables away, having a drunken conversation with a grey-haired farmer.\nMarten was already getting to his feet. Not wanting to draw attention to the situation, I hissed, \u201cGet him,\u201d and forced myself back into my seat.\nI gritted my teeth as Marten threaded quickly through the tables, tapped Dedan on the shoulder, and jerked a thumb toward the table where I sat. Dedan grumbled something I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t hear and grudgingly pushed himself to his feet.\nI forced my eyes to wander around the room rather than follow Dedan. Tempi was easy to spot in his mercenary reds. He was facing the hearth,\n \nwatching the fiddler tune his instrument. There were several empty glasses on the table in front of him, and he had loosened the leather straps of his shirt. He eyed the fiddler with a strange intensity.\nAs I watched, a serving girl brought him another drink. He looked her over, his pale eyes moving pointedly up and down her body. She said something, and he kissed the back of her hand as smoothly as a courtier. She blushed and pushed at his shoulder playfully. One of his hands moved smoothly to the curve of her waist and rested there. She didn\u2019t seem to mind.\nDedan stepped close to my table, eclipsing my view of Tempi just as the fiddler lifted his bow and began to saw out a jig. A dozen people came to their feet, eager to dance.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Dedan demanded as he came to stand in front of my table. \u201cHave ye called me over here to tell me it\u2019s gettin\u2019 late? That I\u2019ve got a busy day tomorrow and I should tuck my little self into bed?\u201d He leaned forward onto the table, putting his eyes more on level with mine. I caught a sour smell on his breath: dreg. A cheap, repulsive liquor you can start fires with.\nI laughed dismissively. \u201cHell, I\u2019m not your mum.\u201d Actually I had been about to say that very thing and scrambled mentally for something else to distract him with. My eye lighted on the redhead that had served me my dinner earlier that evening, and I leaned forward in my seat. \u201cI was wondering if you could tell me something,\u201d I said in my best conspiratorial tone.\nHis scowl gave way to curiosity, and I lowered my voice a little more. \u201cYou\u2019ve been here before, right?\u201d He nodded, leaning a little closer. \u201cDo you know what that girl\u2019s name is?\u201d I nodded my head in the redhead\u2019s direction.\nDedan took an over-careful look over his shoulder that surely would have drawn her attention if she hadn\u2019t been facing away from us. \u201cThe blonde one the Adem\u2019s pawin\u2019 at?\u201d Dedan asked.\n\u201cRedhead.\u201d\nDedan\u2019s broad forehead wrinkled as he squinted the far side of the room into focus. \u201cLosine?\u201d He asked softly. He turned to me, still squinting. \u201cLittle Losi?\u201d\nI shrugged and began to regret my choice of diversionary tactic.\nAn explosive laugh burst out of the big man and he half fell, half slid onto the bench across from me.\n\u201cLosi,\u201d he chuckled a little more loudly than I liked. \u201cKvothe, I had you all wrong.\u201d He slapped the table with the flat of his hand and laughed again,", "nearly tipping himself over backward on the bench. \u201cAh, you\u2019ve got a good eye, boy, but you haven\u2019t got a damn chance.\u201d\nMy battered pride pricked up at this. \u201cWhy not? Isn\u2019t she, well\u2014\u201d I trailed off, making an inarticulate gesture.\nHe somehow managed to gather my meaning. \u201cA whore?\u201d he asked incredulously. \u201cGod boy, no. There\u2019s a couple around.\u201d He made a sweeping gesture over his head, then lowered his voice to a more private level. \u201cNot really whores, mind you. Just girls who don\u2019t mind a little extra at night.\u201d He paused, blinked. \u201cMoney. Extra money. And extra other things.\u201d He chortled.\n\u201cI just thought . . .\u201d I began weakly.\n\u201cAy, any man who ever had eyes and balls thought that.\u201d He leaned a little closer. \u201cShe\u2019s a lusty little one. She\u2019ll trip a man who catches her eye, but she can\u2019t be talked or bought into bed. If she could, she\u2019d be rich as the king of Vint.\u201d He looked in her direction. \u201cHow much\u2019s a roll with that worth? I\u2019d give\u2014\u201d\nHe squinted in her direction, his lips moving as if going through some silent, complex arithmetic. After a moment he shrugged. \u201cMore than I\u2019ve got.\u201d He looked back to me, shrugged again. \u201cStill, it\u2019s no good wishing. Save yourself the trouble. If ye want, I know a lady here who\u2019s no shame to look at. Might be willing to brighten up your evening.\u201d He started to look around the room.\n\u201cNo!\u201d I put my hand on his arm to stop him. \u201cI was just curious, that\u2019s all.\u201d I sounded insincere and I knew it. \u201cThanks for filling me in.\u201d\n\u201cNothin\u2019 to it.\u201d He carefully got to his feet.\n\u201cOh,\u201d I said, as if a thought had just occurred to me. \u201cCould you do me a favor?\u201d He nodded and I gestured him closer. \u201cI\u2019m worried Hespe might end up talking about our job for the Maer. If the bandits hear we\u2019re hunting them, things will get ten times harder.\u201d A guilty look flashed across his face. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure she wouldn\u2019t mention it, but you know how women like to talk.\u201d\n\u201cI understand,\u201d he said quickly as he stood up. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to her. Better to be careful.\u201d\nThe hawk-faced fiddler finished his jig, and everyone clapped and stomped and pounded empty mugs on their tables. I sighed and rubbed my face into my hands. When I looked up I saw Marten at the table next to mine. He touched his fingers to his forehead and nodded a small salute. I gave a slight, seated bow. It\u2019s always nice to have an appreciative audience.", ""], "CHAPTER SEVENTY-EIGHT": ["CHAPTER SEVENTY-EIGHT\nAnother Road, Another Forest\nI TOOK A CERTAIN DARK pleasure in seeing a rather hungover Dedan on the road before the sun was fully in the sky the next morning. The large man carried himself delicately, but to give him due credit, he didn\u2019t offer a word of complaint, unless the occasional low moan can be counted as a word.\nNow that I was watching more closely, I spotted the marks of infatuation on Dedan. The way he said Hespe\u2019s name. The coarse jokes he made when talking to her. Every few minutes he would find an excuse to glance in her direction. Always under some pretext: a stretch, an idle glance at the road, a gesture to the trees around us.\nDespite this, Dedan remained oblivious to the sporadic courtship Hespe was paying him in return. At times it was amusing to watch, like a well- orchestrated Modegan tragedy. At times I wanted to strangle them both.\nTempi traveled wordlessly among us like a mute, well-behaved puppy. He watched everything: the trees, the road, the clouds. If it weren\u2019t for the unquestionably intelligent look in his eyes, I\u2019d have thought him a simpleton by this point. The few questions I put to him were still met with awkward fidgeting, nods, shrugs, or shakes of the head.\nAll the while my curiosity nagged at me. I knew the Lethani was just a piece of storybook nonsense, but part of me couldn\u2019t help but wonder. Was he really saving his words? Could he really use his quiet like armor? Move fast as a snake? The truth was, after catching glimpses of what Elxa Dal and Fela could do by calling on the names of fire and stone, the thought of someone storing up words to burn as fuel didn\u2019t seem nearly as foolish as it used to.\nThe five of us got to know each other in dribs and drabs, growing familiar\n \nwith each other\u2019s quirks. Dedan carefully groomed the ground where he lay his bedroll, not just removing twigs and stones, but stomping flat every tuft of grass or lump of dirt.\nHespe whistled tunelessly when she thought no one was listening and picked her teeth methodically after every meal. Marten wouldn\u2019t eat meat that had the barest bit of pink to it or drink water that hadn\u2019t been boiled or mixed with wine. He told the rest of us at least twice a day that we were fools for not doing the same.\nBut in terms of odd behavior, Tempi was the prize winner of the lot. He wouldn\u2019t look me in the eye. Didn\u2019t smile. Didn\u2019t frown. Didn\u2019t speak.\nSince we left the Pennysworth, he had made only one comment of his own free will. \u201cRain would make this road another road, this forest another forest.\u201d He said each word distinctly, as if he had been deliberating on the statement all day. For all I knew, he had.\nHe washed himself obsessively. The rest of us would take advantage of a bathhouse when we stopped at an inn, but Tempi bathed every day. If there was a stream handy, he would bathe both at night and then again when he woke. Otherwise, he would wash himself using a cloth and some of his drinking water.\nAnd twice a day without fail, he performed an elaborate ritual stretch, his hands making careful shapes and patterns in the air. It reminded me of the slow court dances they perform in Modeg.\nIt obviously kept him limber, but it was strange to watch. Hespe made jokes about how if the bandits asked us to dance, our sweet-smelling mercenary would be a wonderful help. But she said it quietly, when Tempi was out of earshot.\nIn terms of quirks, I suppose I was in no position to throw stones. I played my lute most evenings, when I wasn\u2019t too weary from walking. I daresay it didn\u2019t improve the others\u2019 opinion of me as a tactical leader or arcanist.\nAs we neared our destination, I grew increasingly anxious. Marten was the only one of us truly suited to this work. Dedan and Hespe would be good in a fight, but they were troublesome to work with. Dedan was argumentative and stubborn. Hespe was lazy. She rarely helped prepare meals or clean up afterward unless she was asked, and even then her help was so grudging it was barely any help at all.\nAnd then there was Tempi, a hired killer who wouldn\u2019t look me in the eye or hold a conversation. A mercenary I firmly believed could look forward to", "a decent career in the Modegan theater. . . .\nFive days after leaving Severen, we came to the area where the attacks had been made. A twenty-mile stretch of twisting road that ran through the Eld: no towns, no inns, not even an abandoned farm. An utterly isolated stretch of the king\u2019s highway in the middle of an endless ancient wood. The natural habitat of bears, mad hermits, and poachers. A highwayman\u2019s paradise.\nMarten went scouting while the rest of us set up camp. An hour later he emerged from the trees, winded but in good spirits. He reassured us he hadn\u2019t found sign of anyone else nearby.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m defending tax collectors,\u201d Dedan muttered disgustedly. Hespe gave a throaty laugh.\n\u201cYou\u2019re defending civilization,\u201d I corrected. \u201cAnd you\u2019re keeping the roads safe. Besides, Maer Alveron does important things with those taxes.\u201d I grinned. \u201cLike pay us.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m fighting for,\u201d Marten said.\nAfter dinner, I outlined the only strategy I\u2019d been able to come up with in five long days of thinking. I drew a curving line on the ground with a stick. \u201cOkay. Here\u2019s the road, about twenty miles of it.\u201d\n\u201cMieles.\u201d The soft voice was Tempi\u2019s.\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d I asked. This was the first thing I had heard him say in a day and a half.\n\u201cMiils?\u201d His accent was so thick around the unfamiliar word that it took me a second to understand he was saying \u201cmiles.\u201d\n\u201cMiles.\u201d I said distinctly. I pointed in the direction of the road and held up one finger. \u201cFrom here to the road is one mile. Today we walked fifteen miles.\u201d\nHe nodded once.\nI turned back to my drawing. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to assume the bandits are within ten miles of the road.\u201d I drew a box around my crude sketch of the road. \u201cThat gives us four hundred square miles of forest to search.\u201d\nThere was a moment of silence as everyone absorbed that piece of information. Finally, Tempi spoke, \u201cThat is large.\u201d\nI nodded seriously. \u201cIt would take us months to search that much territory,\n \nbut we shouldn\u2019t have to.\u201d I added a couple more lines to my drawing. \u201cEvery day Marten will scout ahead for us.\u201d I looked up to him. \u201cHow much ground can you safely cover in a day?\u201d\nHe thought for a second, looking around at the trees surrounding us. \u201cThis forest? With this much underscrub? About a square mile.\u201d\n\u201cHow many if you\u2019re being careful?\u201d\nHe smiled. \u201cI\u2019m always careful.\u201d\nI nodded and drew a line parallel to the road. \u201cMarten will scout a strip\nabout a half mile wide, about a mile back from the road. He\u2019ll keep an eye out for their camp or their sentries so the rest of us don\u2019t stumble into them accidentally.\u201d\nHespe shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s no good. They won\u2019t be that close to the road. If they\u2019re looking to stay hid, they\u2019ll be farther back. At least two or three miles.\u201d\nDedan nodded. \u201cI\u2019d make sure I was at least four miles from the road before I hunkered down and made a habit of killing folk.\u201d\n\u201cI think so too,\u201d I agreed. \u201cBut they have to make their way to the road sooner or later. They have to post lookouts and travel back and forth for ambushes. They need to reprovision themselves. Since they\u2019ve been here several months, odds are they\u2019ve worn some sort of trail.\u201d\nI added a little detail to my dirt map with my stick. \u201cAfter Marten has scouted, two of us will go in and make a careful search behind him. We\u2019ll cover a thin strip of forest, searching it for any sign of their trail. The other two will keep an eye on the camp.\n\u201cWe can cover about two miles a day. We\u2019ll start on the north side of the road and search from west to east. If we don\u2019t find a trail, we\u2019ll cross to the south side of the road and work our way back from east to west.\u201d I finished drawing in the dirt and stood back. \u201cWe\u2019ll find their trail in a span of days. Maybe two, depending on our luck.\u201d I leaned back and drove my stick into the ground.\nDedan stared bleakly at the rough map. \u201cWe\u2019ll need more supplies.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll move camp every fifth day. Two of us will walk back to Crosson to get supplies. The other two will move the camp. Marten will rest.\u201d\nMarten spoke up. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to be careful with our fires from now on, too,\u201d he said. \u201cThe smell of smoke will give us away if we\u2019re upwind of them.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll need a fire pit every night, and we\u2019ll want to keep an eye", "out for rennel trees.\u201d I looked at Marten. \u201cYou know what a rennel looks like, don\u2019t you?\u201d His expression was surprised.\nHespe looked back and forth between us. \u201cWhat\u2019s rennel?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tree,\u201d Marten said. \u201cGood for firewood. It burns clean and hot. No smoke to speak of, and hardly any stink of smoke either.\u201d\n\u201cEven when the wood is green,\u201d I said. \u201cSame with the leaves. It\u2019s useful stuff. It doesn\u2019t grow everywhere, but I\u2019ve seen some around.\u201d\n\u201cHow does a city boy like you know something like that?\u201d Dedan asked.\n\u201cKnowing things is what I do,\u201d I said seriously. \u201cAnd what in the world makes you think I grew up in a city?\u201d\nDedan shrugged, looking away.\n\u201cThat should be the only wood we burn from here on out,\u201d I said. \u201cIf it\u2019s in short supply, we\u2019ll save it for a cookfire. If we don\u2019t have any, we\u2019ll have to eat cold. So keep an eye out.\u201d\nEveryone nodded, Tempi slightly later than the rest.\n\u201cLastly, we\u2019d better have our stories straight in case they stumble onto us while we\u2019re looking for them.\u201d I pointed to Marten. \u201cWhat are you going to say if someone catches you while you\u2019re out scouting?\u201d\nHe looked surprised, but hardly hesitated in his response. \u201cI\u2019m a poacher.\u201d He pointed to his unstrung bow leaning against a tree. \u201cIt won\u2019t be far from the truth.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re from?\u201d\nThere was a flicker of hesitation. \u201cCrosson, just a day west of here.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your name is?\u201d\n\u201cM-Meris,\u201d he said awkwardly. Dedan laughed.\nI cracked a smile. \u201cDon\u2019t lie about your name. It\u2019s hard to do convincingly.\nIf they catch you and let you go, fine. Just don\u2019t lead them back to our camp. If they want to take you back with them, make the best of it. Pretend you\u2019d like to join up. Don\u2019t try to run.\u201d\nMarten looked uneasy. \u201cI just stay with them?\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cThey\u2019ll expect you to run on the first night if they think you\u2019re stupid. If they think you\u2019re clever, they\u2019ll expect you to run on the second night. But by the third night they should trust you a bit. Wait until midnight, then start some sort of disturbance. Light a couple of tents on fire or something. We\u2019ll be waiting for the confusion and take them apart from the outside.\u201d\nI looked around at the other three. \u201cThe plan is the same for any of you.", "Wait until the third night.\u201d\n\u201cHow will you find their camp?\u201d Marten asked, a thin layer of sweat on his\nforehead. I didn\u2019t blame him., This was a dangerous game we were playing. \u201cIf they catch me, I won\u2019t be there to help track you down.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t be finding them,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll be finding you. I can find any of you in the forest.\u201d\nI looked around the fire, expecting at least a grumble from Dedan, but none of them seemed to doubt my arcane abilities. Idly, I wondered how much they thought I was capable of.\nThe truth was I\u2019d surreptitiously collected a hair from each of them in the last few days. So I could easily could create a makeshift dowsing pendulum for anyone in the group in less than a minute. Given Vintish superstition, I doubted they\u2019d be happy knowing the specific details.\n\u201cWhat should our stories be?\u201d Hespe tapped Dedan on the chest with the back of her hand, her knuckles making a hollow noise on his hard leather vest.\n\u201cDo you think you could convince them you were disgruntled caravan guards who had decided to turn bandit?\u201d\nDedan snorted. \u201cHell, I\u2019ve thought about it once or twice.\u201d At a look from Hespe he snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you haven\u2019t done the same. Span after span of walking in the rain, eating beans, sleeping on the ground. All for penny a day?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cGod\u2019s teeth. I\u2019m surprised half of us don\u2019t take to the trees.\u201d\nI smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll do just fine.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about him?\u201d Hespe jerked her thumb at Tempi. \u201cNobody is going to believe he\u2019s gone wild. Adem make ten times what we do for a day\u2019s work.\u201d\n\u201cTwenty times,\u201d Dedan grumbled.\nI\u2019d been thinking the same thing. \u201cTempi, what will you do if you are found by the bandits?\u201d\nTempi fidgeted a little, but didn\u2019t say anything. He looked at me briefly, then broke eye contact, glancing down and to the side. I couldn\u2019t tell if he was thinking, or merely confused.\n\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for his Adem reds, he wouldn\u2019t look like anything special,\u201d Marten said. \u201cEven the sword doesn\u2019t look like much.\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like twenty times as much as me, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Dedan\u2019s voice was low, but not so low that everyone couldn\u2019t hear.\nI was worried about Tempi\u2019s outfit too. I\u2019d tried to draw the Adem into a", "conversation several times with the hope of discussing the problem with him, but it was like trying to have a chat with a cat.\nBut the fact that he hadn\u2019t known the word \u201cmiles\u201d made me realize something I should have thought of long before. Aturan wasn\u2019t his native language. Having recently struggled to make myself fluent in Siaru at the University, I could understand the impulse to keep quiet rather than speak and make a fool of myself.\n\u201cHe could try to play along, same as us,\u201d Hespe said dubiously.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to lie convincingly when you\u2019re not good with the language,\u201d I said.\nTempi\u2019s pale eyes darted to each of us as we spoke, but he didn\u2019t offer any comment.\n\u201cFolk underestimate a person who can\u2019t speak well,\u201d Hespe said. \u201cMaybe he could sort of just . . . play dumb? Act confused like he was lost?\u201d\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t have to play dumb,\u201d Dedan continued under his breath. \u201cCould just be dumb.\u201d\nTempi looked at Dedan, still expressionless, but with more intensity than before. He drew a slow, deliberate breath before speaking. \u201cQuiet is not stupid,\u201d he said, his voice flat. \u201cYou? Always talk. Chek chek chek chek chek.\u201d He made a motion with one hand, like a mouth opening and closing. \u201cAlways. Like dog all night barking at tree. Try to be big. No. Just noise. Just dog.\u201d\nI shouldn\u2019t have laughed, but it caught me completely off guard. Partly because I thought of Tempi as so quiet and passive, and partly because he was absolutely right. If Dedan were a dog, he would be a dog that barked endlessly at nothing. Barking just to hear himself bark.\nStill, I shouldn\u2019t have laughed. But I did. Hespe laughed too and tried to hide it, which was worse.\nDedan\u2019s face went dark with anger and he got to his feet. \u201cYou come here and say that.\u201d\nStill expressionless, Tempi stood and walked around the fire until he stood next to Dedan. Well . . . if I say he stood next to him, you will take the wrong impression. Most people stand two or three feet away when talking to you. But Tempi walked until he was less than a foot away from Dedan. To get any closer, he would have had to give him a hug or climb him.\nI could lie and say this happened too quickly for me to intervene, but that wouldn\u2019t be true. The simple truth was that I couldn\u2019t think of an easy way to", "break up the situation. But the more complicated truth was that I was pretty fed up with Dedan myself by this point.\nWhat\u2019s more, this was the most I\u2019d ever heard Tempi speak. For the first time since I\u2019d met him, he was behaving like a person, not just some mute, ambulatory doll.\nAnd I was curious to see him fight. I\u2019d heard a lot about the legendary Adem prowess, and I was hoping to see it thump some of the sullen mutter out of Dedan\u2019s thick head.\nTempi walked up to Dedan, standing close enough to put his arms around him. Dedan stood a full head taller, broader across the shoulders, and thicker in the chest. Tempi looked up at him without a trace of anything you might expect to see on his face. No bravado. No mocking smile. Nothing.\n\u201cJust dog,\u201d Tempi said softly, with no particular inflection. \u201cBig noise dog.\u201d He lifted up his hand and made a mouth of it again. \u201cChek. Chek. Chek.\u201d\nDedan lifted a hand and shoved hard against Tempi\u2019s chest. I\u2019d seen this sort of thing countless times in the taverns near the University. It was the sort of shove that sends a man staggering backward, off balance and prone to stagger and trip.\nExcept Tempi didn\u2019t stagger. He just . . . stepped away. Then he reached out casually and cuffed Dedan along one side of his head, the way a parent might swat an unruly child in the market. It wasn\u2019t even hard enough to move Dedan\u2019s head, but we could all hear a soft paff sound, and Dedan\u2019s hair puffed out like a milkweed pod someone had blown against.\nDedan stood still for a moment, as if he couldn\u2019t quite understand what had happened. Then he frowned and brought both hands up to give Tempi a more violent shove. Tempi stepped away from this too, then swatted Dedan on the other side of his head.\nDedan scowled, grunted, and brought his hands up, making fists. He was a big man, and his mercenary leathers creaked and strained at the shoulders as he lifted his arms. He waited a moment, obviously hoping Tempi would make the first move, then he stomped forward, drew his arm back, and threw a punch, hard and heavy as a farmhand swinging an axe.\nTempi saw it coming and stepped away a third time. But halfway through his clumsy swing, everything about Dedan changed. He raised himself up on the balls of his feet and his ponderous haymaker punch evaporated. Suddenly, he no longer looked like a lumbering bull, and instead, he darted forward and", "snapped out three quick punches, fast as a bird\u2019s wing flapping.\nTempi sidestepped one, slapped the other aside, but the third caught him\nhigh on the shoulder, spinning him partway around and knocking him backward. He took two quick steps out of Dedan\u2019s reach, regained his balance, and shook himself slightly. Then he laughed, high and delighted.\nThe sound softened the expression on Dedan\u2019s face, and he grinned in return, though he didn\u2019t lower his hands or move off the balls of his feet. Despite this, Tempi stepped up, avoided another jab, and struck Dedan in the face with the flat of his hand. Not across the cheek, as if they were squabbling lovers onstage. Tempi\u2019s hand came down from above and struck Dedan across the front of his face, from his forehead down to his chin.\n\u201cArrhhgh!\u201d Dedan shouted. \u201cBlack damn!\u201d He staggered away, clutching at his nose. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Did you just slap me?\u201d He peered out at Tempi from behind his hand. \u201cYou fight like a woman.\u201d\nFor a moment, Tempi looked as if he might object. Then he gave the first smile I had ever seen from him and gave a small nod and shrug instead. \u201cYes. I fight like a woman.\u201d\nDedan hesitated, then laughed and clapped Tempi roughly on the shoulder. I half expected Tempi to dart away from his touch, but instead the Adem returned the gesture, even to the point of gripping Dedan\u2019s shoulder and jostling him around playfully.\nThe display struck me as odd coming from someone who had been so reserved over the last several days, but I decided not to look a gift horse in the mouth. Anything other than fidgety silence from the Adem was a blessing.\nEven better, I now had a measure of Tempi\u2019s fighting ability. Whether or not Dedan wanted to admit it, Tempi obviously had the better of him. I guessed the Adem reputation was more than just empty air.\nMarten watched Tempi return to his seat. \u201cThose clothes are still a problem,\u201d the woodsman said, as if nothing much had happened. He eyed Tempi\u2019s blood-red shirt and pants. \u201cMight as well run around waving a flag as wear that in the trees.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll talk with him about it,\u201d I told the others. If Tempi was self-conscious about his Aturan, I guessed our conversation would go more smoothly without an audience. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll work out what he\u2019ll do if he runs into them. You three can go settle in and get dinner started.\u201d\nThe three of them scattered off, looking to claim the prime places for their", "bedrolls. Tempi watched them go, then turned back to look at me. He glanced down at the ground and took a small, shuffling step away.\n\u201cTempi?\u201d\nHe cocked his head and looked at me.\n\u201cWe need to talk about your clothing.\u201d\nIt happened again as soon as I started to talk. His attention slowly slid\naway from me, his eyes drifting down and to the side. As if he couldn\u2019t be bothered to actually listen. As if he were a sulky child.\nI don\u2019t need to tell you how infuriating it is to try and have a discussion with a person who won\u2019t look you in the eye. Still, I didn\u2019t have the luxury of taking offense or putting off this talk. I\u2019d already delayed this conversation too long.\n\u201cTempi.\u201d I fought the urge to snap my fingers in order to draw his attention back to me. \u201cYour clothes are red,\u201d I said, trying to keep it as simple as possible. \u201cEasy to see. Dangerous.\u201d\nHe gave no response for a long moment. Then his pale eyes darted up to mine and he nodded, a simple bob of the head.\nI began to have a horrible suspicion that he might not actually understand what it was we were doing out here in the Eld. \u201cTempi, you know what we are doing out here, in the forest?\u201d\nTempi\u2019s eyes moved to my rough sketch in the dirt, then back up at me. He shrugged and made a vague gesture with both hands. \u201cWhat is many but not all?\u201d\nAt first I thought he was asking some strange philosophical question, then I realized he was asking for a word. I held up my hand and grabbed two of my fingers. \u201cSome?\u201d I grabbed three fingers. \u201cMost?\u201d\nTempi watched my hands intently, nodding. \u201cMost,\u201d he said, fidgeting. \u201cI know most. Talk is fast.\u201d\n\u201cWe are looking for men.\u201d His eyes slid away as soon as I started to speak, and I fought the urge to sigh. \u201cWe are trying to find men.\u201d\nNod. \u201cYes. Hunt men.\u201d He stressed the word. \u201cHunt visantha.\u201d\nAt least he knew why we were here. \u201cRed?\u201d I reached out and touched the red leather strap that held the fabric of his shirt tight to his body. It was surprisingly soft. \u201cFor hunting? Do you have other clothes? Not red?\u201d\nTempi looked down at his outfit, fidgeting. Then he nodded and went over to his pack and drew out a shirt of plain grey homespun. He held it up for me. \u201cFor hunting. But not fighting.\u201d", "I wasn\u2019t sure what his distinction meant, but I was willing to let it go for now. \u201cWhat will you do if visantha find you in the forest?\u201d I asked. \u201cTalk or fight?\u201d\nHe seemed to think about it for a moment. \u201cNot good at talk,\u201d he admitted. \u201cVisantha? Fight.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cOne bandit, fight. Two, talk.\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cCan fight two.\u201d\n\u201cFight and win?\u201d\nHe gave another nonchalant shrug and pointed to where Dedan was\ncarefully picking twigs out of the sod. \u201cLike him? Three or four.\u201d He held out his hand, palm up, as if offering me something. \u201cIf three bandit, I fight. If four, I try best talk. I wait until three night. Then . . .\u201d he made an odd, elaborate gesture with both hands. \u201cFire in tents.\u201d\nI relaxed, glad he had followed our earlier discussion. \u201cYes. Good. Thank you.\u201d\nThe five of us had a quiet dinner of soup, bread, and a rather unimpressive gummy cheese we\u2019d bought in Crosson. Dedan and Hespe bickered in a friendly way, and I speculated with Marten about what sort of weather we might expect over the next few days.\nOther than that, there wasn\u2019t much chatter. Two of us had already come to blows. We\u2019d come a hundred miles since Severen, and we were all aware of the grim work ahead of us.\n\u201cHold on,\u201d Marten said. \u201cWhat if they catch you?\u201d He looked up at me. \u201cWe all have a plan if the bandits find us. We head back with them and you\u2019ll track us down on the third day.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget the distraction.\u201d\nMarten looked anxious. \u201cBut what if they catch you? I don\u2019t have any magic. I can\u2019t guarantee I\u2019ll be able to track them down by that third night. Probably, sure. But tracking isn\u2019t a certain thing. . . .\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just a harmless musician,\u201d I reassured him. \u201cI got in some trouble with the Baronet Banbride\u2019s niece and thought it would be best if I legged it into the forest for a while.\u201d I grinned. \u201cThey might rob me, but as I don\u2019t have much, they\u2019ll probably just let me go. I\u2019m a persuasive fellow, and I don\u2019t look like much of a threat.\u201d\nDedan muttered something under his breath I was glad I couldn\u2019t hear.\n\u201cBut what if?\u201d Hespe pressed. \u201cMarten\u2019s got a point. What if they take you back with them?\u201d", "That was something I hadn\u2019t figured out yet, but rather than end the evening on a sour note, I smiled my most confident smile. \u201cIf they take me back to their camp, I should be able to kill them off myself without much trouble.\u201d I shrugged with exaggerated nonchalance. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you back at camp after the job is done.\u201d I thumped the ground beside me, grinning.\nI had intended it as a joke, sure Marten at least would chuckle at my flippant response. But I\u2019d underestimated how deep Vintic superstition tends to run, and my comment was met with an uncomfortable silence.\nThere was little conversation after that. We drew lots for the watch, doused the fire, and one by one we drifted off to sleep.", ""], "CHAPTER SEVENTY-NINE": ["CHAPTER SEVENTY-NINE\nSigns\nAFTER BREAKFAST, MARTEN BEGAN teaching Tempi and me how to search for the bandits\u2019 trail.\nAnyone can spot a piece of torn shirt hanging from a branch or a footprint gouged into the dirt, but those things never happen in real life. They make for convenient plot devices in plays, but really, when have you ever torn your clothing so seriously that you\u2019ve left a piece of it behind?\nNever. The people we were hunting were clever, so we couldn\u2019t count on them making any obvious mistakes. That meant Marten was the only one among us who had any idea what we were really looking for.\n\u201cAny broken twig,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll mostly be where things are thick and tangled: waist high or ankle high.\u201d He gestured as if kicking through thick scrub and pushing things aside with his hands. \u201cSeeing the actual break is hard, so look at the leaves instead.\u201d He gestured to a nearby bush. \u201cWhat do you see there?\u201d\nTempi pointed at a lower branch. He wore his plain grey homespun today, and without his mercenary reds, he looked even less imposing.\nI looked where Tempi was pointing and saw the branch had been snapped, but not badly enough to break off.\n\u201cSo someone has been through here?\u201d I asked\nMarten shrugged his bow higher up on his shoulder. \u201cI was. I did this last night.\u201d He looked at us. \u201cSee how even the leaves that aren\u2019t hanging strange are starting to wilt?\nI nodded.\n\u201cThat means someone has been by this way within a day or so. If it\u2019s been two or three days, the leaves will brown out and die. You see both close to each other . . .\u201d He looked at me.\n\u201cIt means you have someone moving through the area more than once, days apart.\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cSince I\u2019m scouting and keeping an eye out for bandits, you\u2019ll", "be the ones with your noses to the ground. When you find something like this, call me.\u201d\n\u201cCall?\u201d Tempi cupped his hands around his mouth and turned his head in different directions. He made a wide gesture to the surrounding trees and put his hand to his ear, pretending to listen.\nMarten frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re right. You can\u2019t just go shouting for me.\u201d He rubbed the back of his neck in frustration. \u201cDamn, we didn\u2019t think this all the way through.\u201d\nI smiled at him. \u201cI thought it through,\u201d I said, and brought out a rough wooden whistle I\u2019d carved last night. It only had two notes, but that was all we needed. I put it to my mouth and blew. Ta-ta DEE. Ta-ta DEE.\nMarten grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s a Will\u2019s Widow, isn\u2019t it? The pitch is dead on.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s what I do.\u201d\nHe cleared his throat. \u201cUnfortunately, Will\u2019s Widow is also called a night-\njar.\u201d He grimaced apologetically. \u201cNight-jar, mind you. That\u2019ll catch at the ear of any experienced woodsman like a fishhook if you go blowing it every time you want me to come take a look at something.\u201d\nI looked down at the whistle. \u201cBlack hands,\u201d I swore. \u201cI should have thought of that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good idea,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just need one for a daytime bird. Maybe a gold piper.\u201d He whistled two notes. \u201cThat should be simple enough.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll carve a different one tonight,\u201d I said, then reached down for a twig. I snapped it and handed half to Marten. \u201cThis will do if I need to signal you today.\u201d\nHe looked at the stick oddly. \u201cHow exactly will this help?\u201d\n\u201cWhen we need your opinion on something we\u2019ve found, I\u2019ll do this.\u201d I concentrated, muttered a binding, and moved my half of the stick.\nMarten jumped two feet up and five feet back, dropping the stick. To his credit, he didn\u2019t shout. \u201cWhat in ten hells was that?\u201d he hissed, wringing his hand.\nHis reaction had startled me, and my own heart was racing. \u201cMarten, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just a little sympathy.\u201d I saw a wrinkle in between his eyebrows and changed my tack. \u201cJust a small magic. It\u2019s like a bit of magic string I use to tie two things together.\u201d\nI imagined Elxa Dal swallowing his tongue at this description, but pressed ahead. \u201cI can tie these things together, so when I tug on mine . . .\u201d I moved to stand over where his half of the twig lay on the ground. I raised my half, and", "the half on the ground lifted into the air.\nMy display had the desired effect. Moving together, the two twigs looked\nlike the crudest, saddest string puppet in the world. Nothing to be frightened of. \u201cIt\u2019s just like invisible string, except it won\u2019t get tangled or caught on anything.\u201d\n\u201cHow hard will it pull at me?\u201d he asked warily. \u201cI don\u2019t want it yanking me out of a tree when I\u2019m scouting.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just me on the other end of the string,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll just jiggle it a bit. Like the float on a fishing line.\u201d\nMarten stopped wringing his hand and relaxed a little. \u201cStartled me is all,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s my fault,\u201d I said. \u201cI should have warned you.\u201d I picked up the stick, handling it with a deliberate casualness. As if it were nothing more than an ordinary stick. Of course it was nothing more than an ordinary stick, but Marten needed to be reassured as to that point. It\u2019s like Teccam said, nothing in the world is harder than convincing someone of an unfamiliar truth.\nMarten showed us how to see when leaves or needles had been disturbed, how to spot when stones had been walked across, how to tell if moss or lichen had been damaged by someone\u2019s passing.\nThe old huntsman was a surprisingly good teacher. He didn\u2019t belabor his points, didn\u2019t talk down to us, and didn\u2019t mind questions. Even Tempi\u2019s trouble with the language didn\u2019t frustrate him.\nEven so, it took hours. A full half day. Then, when I thought we were finally finished, Marten turned us around and started leading us back toward the camp.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already been that way,\u201d I said. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to practice, let\u2019s practice in the right direction.\u201d\nMarten ignored me and kept walking. \u201cTell me what you see.\u201d\nTwenty paces later, Tempi pointed. \u201cMoss,\u201d he said. \u201cMy foot. I walked.\u201d Realization dawned, and I began to see all the marks Tempi and I had\nmade. For the next three hours, Marten walked us step by humiliating step back through the trees, showing us everything we had done to betray our presence there: a scuff against the lichen on a tree trunk, a piece of freshly\n \nbroken rock, the discoloration of overturned pine needles.\nWorst of all were a half-dozen bright green leaves that lay shredded on the\nground in a tidy semicircle. Marten raised an eyebrow, and I blushed. I had plucked them from a nearby bush, idly shredding them while listening to Marten.\n\u201cThink twice and step carefully,\u201d Marten said. \u201cAnd keep an eye on each other.\u201d He looked back and forth between Tempi and me. \u201cWe\u2019re playing a dangerous game here.\u201d\nThen Marten showed us how to cover our tracks. It quickly became clear that a poorly concealed sign was often more obvious than one simply left alone. So over the next two hours we learned how to hide our mistakes and spot mistakes that others had tried to hide.\nOnly then, as afternoon was turning to evening, did Tempi and I begin searching this swath of forest bigger than most baronies. We walked close together, zigzagging back and forth, looking for any sign of the bandits\u2019 trail.\nI thought about the long days stretching out ahead of us. I\u2019d thought searching the Archives had been tedious. But looking for a broken twig in this much forest made hunting for the gram seem like going to the baker for a bun.\nIn the Archives I had the chance to make accidental discoveries. In the Archives I\u2019d had my friends: conversation, jokes, affection. Looking sideways at Tempi, I realized I could count the words he had said today: twenty-four, and the number of times he had met my eye: three.\nHow long would this take? Ten days? Twenty? Merciful Tehlu, could I spend a month out here without going mad?\nWith thoughts like this, when I saw some bark chipped off a tree and a tuft of grass bent the wrong way, I was flooded with relief.\nNot wanting to get my hopes up, I motioned to Tempi. \u201cDo you see anything here?\u201d He nodded, fidgeting with the collar of his shirt, then pointed to the grass I\u2019d spotted. Then he pointed to a scuffed bit of exposed root I hadn\u2019t noticed.\nAlmost light-headed with excitement, I pulled out the oak twig and signaled Marten. I twitched it very gently, not wanting to send him into another panic.\nIt was only two minutes before Marten came out of the trees, but in that time, I had already formed three plans as to how to track and kill the bandits, composed five apologetic soliloquies to Denna, and decided that when I got", "back to Severen, I would donate money to the Tehlin church as thanks for this tangible miracle.\nI expected Marten to be irritated that we\u2019d called him back so soon. But his expression was purely matter-of-fact as he came to stand next to us.\nI pointed out the grass, the bark, and the root. \u201cTempi spotted the last.\u201d I said, giving credit where credit is due.\n\u201cGood,\u201d he said seriously. \u201cGood job. There\u2019s also a bent branch over there.\u201d He gestured a few paces off to the right.\nI turned to face the direction the trail seemed to indicate. \u201cOdds are they\u2019re going to be north of here,\u201d I said. \u201cFarther from the road. Do you think it would be better to scout things out a bit now, or wait until tomorrow when we\u2019re fresh?\u201d\nMarten squinted at me. \u201cGood lord, boy. These aren\u2019t real trail signs. So obvious, all so close together.\u201d He gave me a long look.\u201cI left them. I needed to make sure you weren\u2019t going to glaze over after a few minutes of looking.\u201d My elation fell from some place in my chest and landed around my feet, shattering like a glass jar tipped from a high shelf. My expression must have been pitiful, as Marten gave me an apologetic smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should have told you. I\u2019ll be doing it off and on every day. It\u2019s the only chance we have to stay alert. This isn\u2019t my first time hunting through haystacks, you know.\u201d\nThe third time we called Martin back, he suggested we make a standing wager. Tempi and I would win a ha\u2019penny for every sign we found, and he\u2019d win a silver bit for every one we missed. I jumped at the offer. Not only would it help keep us on our toes, but five-to-one odds seemed rather generous.\nThis made the rest of the day pass quickly. Tempi and I missed a few signs: a log shifted out of place, some scattered leaves, and a broken spiderweb. I thought this last one was a bit unfair, but even so, by the time we headed back to camp that evening, Tempi and I were two pennies ahead.\nOver supper, Marten told a story about a young widow\u2019s son who left home to make his fortune. A tinker sold him a pair of magic boots that helped him rescue a princess from a tower high in the mountains.\n \nDedan nodded along while he ate, smiling as if he\u2019d heard it before. Hespe laughed in places, gasped in others, the perfect audience. Tempi sat perfectly still with his hands folded in his lap, showing none of the nervous restlessness I\u2019d come to expect from him. He stayed that way through the entire story, listening while his dinner grew cold.\nThe story was a good one. There was a hungry giant and a riddle game. But the widow\u2019s son was clever, and in the end he brought the princess back and married her. It was a familiar story, and listening to it reminded me of days long gone, back when I had a home, a family.", ""], "CHAPTER EIGHTY": ["CHAPTER EIGHTY\nTone\nTHE NEXT DAY MARTEN left with Hespe and Dedan while Tempi and I remained behind to keep an eye on the camp.\nWith nothing else to occupy my time, I started gathering extra firewood. Then I searched for useful herbs in the undergrowth and brought water from the nearby spring. Then I busied myself by unpacking, sorting, and rearranging everything in my travelsack.\nTempi disassembled his sword, meticulously cleaning and oiling all the pieces. He didn\u2019t look bored, but then again, he never looked like anything.\nBy midday I was nearly mad with boredom. I would have read, but I hadn\u2019t brought a book. I would have sewn pockets into my threadbare cloak, but I didn\u2019t have any spare cloth. I would have played my lute, but a trouper\u2019s lute is designed to carry music through a noisy taproom. Out here, the sound of it could carry for miles.\nI would have chatted with Tempi, but trying to have a conversation with him was like playing catch with a well.\nStill, it seemed to be my only option. I walked over to where Tempi sat. He had finished cleaning his sword and was making small adjustments to the leather grip. \u201cTempi?\u201d\nTempi lay aside his sword and came to his feet. He stood uncomfortably close to me, with barely more than eight inches of space between us. Then he hesitated and frowned. It wasn\u2019t much of a frown, barely a thinning of the lips and a slight line between his eyebrows, but on Tempi\u2019s blank sheet of a face, it stood out like a word written in red ink.\nHe backed away from me by two good paces, then eyed the ground between us and stepped forward slightly.\nUnderstanding dawned on me. \u201cTempi, how close do Adem stand?\u201d\nTempi looked at me blankly for a second, then burst out laughing. A shy smile flickered onto his face, making him look very young. It left his mouth quickly, but lingered around his eyes. \u201cSmart. Yes. Different in Adem. For", "you, close.\u201d He stepped uncomfortably close, then backed away. \u201cFor me?\u201d I asked. \u201cIs it different for different people?\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cHow close for Dedan?\u201d\nHe fidgeted. \u201cComplicated.\u201d\nI felt a familiar curiosity flicker up inside me. \u201cTempi,\u201d I asked. \u201cWould you teach me these things? Teach me your language?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said. And though his face betrayed none of it, I could hear a great weight of relief in his voice. \u201cYes. Please. Yes.\u201d\nBy the end of the afternoon, I had learned a wild, useless scattering of Ademic words. The grammar was still a mystery, but that is how it always begins. Luckily, languages are like musical instruments: the more you know, the easier it is to pick up new ones. Ademic was my fourth.\nOur major problem was that Tempi\u2019s Aturan was not very good, which gave us little common ground. So we drew in the dirt, pointed, and waved our hands quite a bit. Several times, when mere gestures were not enough, we ended up performing something close to pantomime or little mummer\u2019s plays in order to get our meaning across. It was more entertaining than I had expected.\nThere was one stumbling block the first day. I had learned a dozen words and thought of another that would be useful. I made a fist and pretended to throw a punch at Tempi.\n\u201cFreaht,\u201d he said.\n\u201cFreaht,\u201d I repeated.\nHe shook his head. \u201cNo. Freaht.\u201d\n\u201cFreaht,\u201d I said carefully.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cFreaht is . . .\u201d He bared his teeth and worked his\njaw as if he were biting something. \u201cFreaht.\u201d He punched his fist into his palm.\n\u201cFreaht,\u201d I said.\n\u201cNo.\u201d I was amazed at the weight of condescension in his voice. \u201cFreaht.\u201d My face got hot. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. Freaht! Freaht! Fre\u2014\u201d\nTempi reached out and smacked me in the side of the head with the flat of\n \nhis hand. It was the same way he had struck Dedan last night, the way my father had cuffed me when I was being troublesome in public. It wasn\u2019t hard enough to hurt, it was just startling. No one had done that to me in years.\nEven more startling was that I hardly saw it. The motion was smooth and lazy and faster than snapping your fingers. He didn\u2019t seem to mean anything insulting by it. He was merely getting my attention.\nHe lifted his sandy hair and pointed to his ear. \u201cHear,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cFreaht.\u201d He bared his teeth again, making a biting motion. \u201cFreaht.\u201d Raised fist. \u201cFreaht. Freaht.\u201d\nAnd I did hear it. It wasn\u2019t the sound of the word itself, it was the cadence of the word. \u201cFreaht?\u201d I said.\nHe favored me with a small, rare smile. \u201cYes. Good.\u201d\nThen I had to go back and relearn all the words, making note of their rhythm. I hadn\u2019t really heard it before, just mimicked it. Slowly, I discovered each word could have several different meanings depending on cadence of the sound that composed them.\nI learned the all-important phrases \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d and \u201cExplain that more slowly,\u201d in addition to a couple dozen words: Fight. Look. Sword. Hand. Dance. The dumbshow I had to perform to get him to understand the last of these left both of us laughing.\nIt was fascinating. The differing cadences of each word meant the language itself had a sort of music to it. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder . . .\n\u201cTempi?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat are your songs like?\u201d He looked at me blankly for a moment, and I thought he might not understand the abstract question. \u201cCould you sing me an Adem song?\u201d\n\u201cWhat is song?\u201d he asked. In the last hour, Tempi had learned twice as many words as I had.\nI cleared my throat and sang:\nLittle Jenny no-shoes went a-walking with the wind.\nShe was looking for a bonny boy to laugh and make her grin.\nUpon her head a feather cap, upon her lips a whistle.\nHer lips were wet and honey sweet. Her tongue was sharp as thistle.\nTempi\u2019s eyes went wide as I sang. He practically gaped.\n\u201cYou?\u201d I prompted, pointing to his chest. \u201cCan you sing an Adem song?\u201d His face flushed a burning red, and a dozen emotions ran wild and", "undisguised over his face: astonishment, horror, embarrassment, shock, disgust. He got to his feet, turning away and chattering something in Ademic far too quickly for me to follow. He looked for all the world as if I\u2019d just asked him to strip naked and dance for me.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, managing to collect himself somewhat. His face was composed again, but his fair skin was still flushed a violent red. \u201cNo.\u201d Looking down at the ground, he touched his chest, shaking his head. \u201cNo song. No Adem song.\u201d\nI got to my feet as well, not knowing what I\u2019d done wrong. \u201cTempi. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nTempi shook his head. \u201cNo. Nothing sorry.\u201d He drew a deep breath and shook his head as he turned and started to walk away. \u201cComplicated.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER EIGHTY-ONE": ["CHAPTER EIGHTY-ONE\nThe Jealous Moon\nTHAT EVENING MARTEN SHOT a trio of fat rabbits. I dug roots and picked a few herbs, and before the sun was down the five of us sat down to a meal made perfect by the addition of two large loaves of fresh bread, butter, and a crumbly cheese too local to have any specific name.\nSpirits were high after a day of good weather, and so with dinner came more stories.\nHespe told a surprisingly romantic tale of a queen who loved a serving boy. She told her story with a gentle passion. And if her telling didn\u2019t show a tender heart, the looks she gave Dedan as she spoke of the queen\u2019s love did.\nDedan, however, failed to see the marks of love on her. And with a folly I have rarely seen equaled, he began to tell a story he\u2019d heard at the Pennysworth Inn. A tale of Felurian.\n\u201cThe boy who told me this was hardly as old as Kvothe here,\u201d Dedan said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019d heard him talk you\u2019d have seen he wasn\u2019t the sort who could invent such a tale.\u201d The mercenary tapped his temple meaningfully. \u201cBut listen and judge for yourself if it\u2019s worth believing.\u201d\nAs I\u2019ve said, Dedan had a good tongue in his head, and a sharper wit than you\u2019d guess, when he decided to use it. Unfortunately, this was one of the times that the former was working and the latter was not.\n\u201cFor time out of mind, men have been wary of this stretch of woods. Not for fear of lawless men or becoming lost.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNo. They say the fair folk make their homes here.\n\u201cCloven-hoofed pucks that dance when the moon is full. Dark things with long fingers that steal babes from cribs. Many\u2019s the woman, old wife or new, who leaves out bread and milk at night. And many\u2019s the man who makes well sure he builds his house with all his doors in a row.\n\u201cSome might call these folk superstitious, but they know the truth. The safest thing is to avoid the Fae, but barring that, you want to keep in their good graces.", "\u201cThis is a story of Felurian. Lady of Twilight. Lady of the First Quiet. Felurian, who is death to men. But a glad death, and one they go to willingly.\u201d\nTempi drew a breath. It was a small motion, but it was eye-catching as he\u2019d continued his habit of sitting perfectly still through the evening\u2019s stories. Now this made better sense to me. He was being quiet.\n\u201cFelurian,\u201d Tempi asked. \u201cDeath to men. She is\u2014\u201d he paused. \u201cShe is sentin?\u201d He lifted his hands in front of himself and made a sort of gripping gesture. He eyed us expectantly. Then, seeing we didn\u2019t understand, he touched his sword where it lay at his side.\nI understood. \u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019s not one of the Adem.\u201d\nTempi shook his head and pointed at Marten\u2019s bow.\nI shook my head. \u201cNo. She\u2019s not a fighter at all. She . . .\u201d I trailed off,\nunable to think of how I would explain how Felurian killed men, especially if we were forced to resort to gestures. Desperate, I looked to Dedan for help.\nDedan didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cSex,\u201d he said frankly. \u201cDo you know sex?\u201d\nTempi blinked, then threw back his head and laughed. Dedan looked as if he were trying to decide whether or not to be offended. After a moment Tempi caught his breath. \u201cYes,\u201d he said simply. \u201cYes. I know sex.\u201d\nDedan smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s how she kills men.\u201d\nFor a moment, Tempi looked more blank than usual, then a slow horror spread across his face. No, not horror, it was raw disgust and revulsion, made all the worse by the fact that his face was usually so blank. His hand clenched into several unfamiliar gestures at his side. \u201cHow?\u201d he choked out the word.\nDedan started to say something, then stopped. Then he started to make a gesture and stopped that as well, looking self-consciously at Hespe.\nHespe chuckled low in her throat and turned to Tempi. She thought for a moment, then made a gesture as if holding someone in her arms, kissing them. Then she began to tap her chest rhythmically, mimicking a heartbeat. She beat faster and faster, then stopped, clenching her hand into a fist and making her eyes wide. She tensed her whole body, then went limp, lolling her head to one side.\nDedan laughed and clapped at her performance. \u201cThat\u2019s it. But sometimes . . .\u201d He tapped his temple, then snapped his fingers, crossing his eyes and sticking out his tongue. \u201cCrazy.\u201d\nTempi relaxed. \u201cOh,\u201d he said, plainly relieved. \u201cGood. Yes.\u201d\nDedan nodded and settled back into his story. \u201cRight. Felurian. Fondest", "desire of all men. Beauty beyond compare.\u201d For Tempi\u2019s benefit, he made a gesture as if he were brushing out long hair.\n\u201cTwenty years ago, this boy\u2019s father and uncle were out hunting in this very stretch of forest as the sun began to set. They stayed out later than they should, then decided to make their way home by cutting straight through the forest instead of using the road like sensible folk.\n\u201cThey hadn\u2019t been walking very long when they heard singing in the distance. They made their way toward it, thinking they were close to the road, but instead they found themselves at the edge of a small clearing. And there stood Felurian singing softly to herself:\nCae-Lanion Luhial di mari Felanua Kreata Tu ciar\ntu alaran di Dirella. Amauen. Loesi an delan\ntu nia vor ruhlan Felurian thae.\u201d\nThough Dedan made rough work of the tune, I shivered at the sound of it. The melody was eerie, compelling, and utterly unfamiliar. I didn\u2019t recognize the language, either. Not a bit of it.\nDedan nodded as he saw my reaction. \u201cMore than anything, that song gives the boy\u2019s story the ring of truth. I can\u2019t put a bit of sense to those words, but they stuck right in my head even though he only sang it once.\n\u201cSo the two brothers are huddled at the edge of the clearing. And thanks to the moon they could see like it was noon instead of night. She wan\u2019t wearing a stitch, and though her hair was almost to her waist, it were real obvious she was as naked as the moon.\u201d\nI have always enjoyed stories about Felurian, but as I glanced at Hespe my anticipation cooled. She was watching Dedan, and as he spoke, her eyes narrowed.\nDedan failed to see this. \u201cShe was tall with long graceful legs. Her waist was slender, her hips curved as if begging for the touch of a hand. Her stomach was perfect and smooth, like a flawless piece of birch bark, and the dimple of her navel seemed made for kissing.\u201d", "Hespe\u2019s eyes were dangerous slits by this point. But even more telling was her mouth, which had formed a thin, straight line. A word of advice to you. Should you ever see that look on a woman\u2019s face, leave off talking at once and sit on both your hands. It may not mend matters, but it will at least keep you from making them any worse.\nUnfortunately Dedan continued, his thick hands gesturing in the firelight. \u201cHer breasts were full and round, like peaches waiting to be taken from the tree. Even the jealous moon which steals the color from all things couldn\u2019t hide the rosy\u2014\u201d\nHespe made a disgusted noise and pushed herself to her feet. \u201cI\u2019ll just leave then,\u201d she said. Her voice held such a chill even Dedan couldn\u2019t miss it.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d He looked up to her, still holding his hands in front of himself, frozen in the act of cupping an imagined pair of breasts.\nShe stormed away, muttering under her breath.\nDedan let his hands drop heavily into his lap. His expression moved from confused to injured to angry in the space of a breath. After a second he got to his feet, roughly brushing bits of leaf and twig from his pants and muttering to himself. Gathering up his blankets, he started toward the other side of our little clearing.\n\u201cDid it end with both brothers chasing after her, and the boy\u2019s father falling behind?\u201d I asked.\nDedan looked back at me. \u201cYou\u2019ve already heard it then. You could have stopped me if you didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just guessing,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cI hate not hearing the ending of a story.\u201d\n\u201cFather put his foot in a rabbit hole,\u201d Dedan said shortly. \u201cSprained his ankle. Nobody saw the uncle again.\u201d He stalked out of the circle of firelight, his expression grim.\nI cast an imploring look at Marten, who shook his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI won\u2019t have any part of it. Not for the world. Trying to help right now would be like trying to put out a fire with my hands. Painful, and with no real results.\u201d\nTempi began to make up his bed. Marten made a circular gesture with one finger and gave me a questioning look, asking if I wanted the first watch. I nodded, and he gathered up his bedroll, saying, \u201cAttractive as some things are, you have to weigh your risks. How badly do you want it, how badly are you willing to be burned?\u201d", "I spread the fire and soon the deep dark of night settled into the clearing. I lay on my back, looked at the stars, and thought of Denna.", ""], "CHAPTER EIGHTY-TWO": ["CHAPTER EIGHTY-TWO\nBarbarians\nTHE NEXT DAY, TEMPI and I moved camp while Dedan and Hespe walked back to Crosson for supplies. Marten scouted out an isolated piece of flat ground close to water. Then we packed and moved everything, dug the privy, built the firepit, and generally got everything settled.\nTempi was willing to talk as we worked, but I was nervous. I had offended him by asking about the Lethani early on, so I knew to avoid that subject. But if he was upset by a simple question about singing, how could I begin to guess what might offend him?\nAgain, his blank expression and refusal to make eye contact were the main problems. How could I make intelligent conversation with a person when I had no idea how he felt? It was like trying to walk blindfolded through an unfamiliar house.\nSo I took the safer road and simply asked for more words as we worked. Objects, for the most part, as we were both too busy with our hands to pantomime.\nBest of all, Tempi got to practice his Aturan while I built up my Ademic vocabulary. I noticed the more mistakes I made in his language, the more comfortable he grew in his own attempts at expressing himself.\nThis meant, of course, that I made many mistakes. In fact, I was occasionally so thickheaded that Tempi was forced to explain himself several times in several different ways. All in Aturan of course.\nWe finished setting up camp around noon. Marten left to go hunting and Tempi stretched and began to move through his slow dance. He did it twice in a row, and I began to suspect he was somewhat bored himself. By the time he finished he was covered in a sheen of sweat and told me he was going to bathe.\nWith the camp to myself, I melted down the tinker\u2019s candles to make two small wax simulacra. I\u2019d been wanting to do this for days, but even at the University creating a mommet was questionable behavior. Here in Vintas . . .", "suffice to say I thought it best to be discreet.\nIt wasn\u2019t elegant work. Tallow isn\u2019t nearly as convenient as sympathy wax,\nbut even the crudest mommet can be a devastating thing. Once I had them tucked into my travelsack, I felt much better prepared.\nI was cleaning the last of the tallow off my fingers when Tempi returned from his bath, naked as a new baby. Years of stage training allowed me to keep a calm expression, but just barely.\nAfter spreading his wet clothing over a nearby branch to dry, Tempi walked over to me without showing the least embarrassment or modesty.\nHe held out his right hand, thumb and forefinger pinched together. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d He spread his fingers slightly for me to see.\nI looked closely, glad to have something to focus my attention on. \u201cThat\u2019s a tick.\u201d\nThis close, I couldn\u2019t help but notice his scars again, faint lines crossing his arms and chest. I could read scars from my time in the Medica, and his didn\u2019t show the wide, puckered pink that would indicate a deep wound cutting through the layers of skin, fat, and muscle underneath. These were shallow wounds. Dozens of them. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder how long he had been a mercenary to have scars so old. He didn\u2019t look much older than twenty.\nOblivious to my scrutiny, Tempi stared at the thing between his fingers. \u201cIt bites. On me. Bites and stays.\u201d His expression was blank as always, but his tone was tinged with disgust. His left hand fidgeted.\n\u201cThere are no ticks in Ademre?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d He made a point of trying to pinch it between his fingers. \u201cIt not break.\u201d\nI gestured, showing him how to crush it between his fingernails, which he did with a certain amount of relish. He threw it away and stalked back to his bedroll. Then, still naked, he proceeded to pull out all of his clothing and give it a vigorous shaking.\nI kept my eyes averted, knowing deep down in my heart that this would be the moment Dedan and Hespe would return from Crosson.\nThankfully they didn\u2019t. After a quarter hour or so, Tempi put on a pair of dry pants, carefully inspecting them first.\nShirtless, he walked back to where I sat. \u201cI hate tick,\u201d he declared.\nWhen he spoke, his left hand made a sharp gesture, as if he were brushing crumbs off the front of his shirt near his hip. Except he wasn\u2019t wearing a", "shirt, and there was nothing on his bare skin to brush away. What\u2019s more, I realized he\u2019d made the same gesture earlier.\nIn fact, now that I thought of it, I\u2019d seen him make that gesture a half- dozen times in the last several days, though never so violently.\nI had a sudden suspicion. \u201cTempi? What does this mean?\u201d I mimicked the brushing away gesture.\nHe nodded. \u201cIt is this.\u201d He scrunched his face up in an exaggerated expression of disgust.\nMy mind went spinning back over the last span of days, thinking of how many times I had seen Tempi fidgeting restlessly while we talked. I reeled at the thought of it.\n\u201cTempi,\u201d I asked. \u201cIs all of this?\u201d I made a gesture to my face, then smiled, frowned, rolled my eyes. \u201cDoes all this happen with hands in Ademic?\u201d\nHe nodded and made a gesture at the same time.\n\u201cThat!\u201d I pointed at his hand. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\nHe hesitated, then gave a forced, awkward-looking smile.\nI copied the gesture, splaying my hand slightly and pressing my thumb to\nthe inside of my middle finger.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cOther hand. Left.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nHe reached out and thumped on my chest, just left of the breastbone: Tum-\ntump. Tum-tump. Then he ran a finger down to my left hand. I nodded to show I understood. It was closest to the heart. He held up his right hand and made a fist. \u201cThis hand is strong.\u201d He held up his left. \u201cThis hand is clever.\u201d\nIt made sense. That is why most lutists chord with the left hand and strum with their right. The left hand is more nimble, as a rule.\nI made the gesture with my left hand, fingers splayed. Tempi shook his head. \u201cThat is this.\u201d He quirked half of his mouth up into a smirk.\nThe expression seemed so out of place on his face that it was all I could do to keep from gawking. I looked more closely at his hand and adjusted the position of my fingers slightly.\nHe nodded approval. His face was expressionless, but for the first time I understood why.\nIn the hours that followed, I learned that Ademic hand gestures did not actually represent facial expressions. It was nothing so simple as that. For example a smile can mean you\u2019re amused, happy, grateful, or satisfied. You can smile to comfort someone. You can smile because you\u2019re content or", "because you\u2019re in love. A grimace or a grin look similar to a smile, but they mean entirely different things.\nImagine trying to teach someone how to smile. Imagine trying to describe what different smiles mean and when, precisely, to use them in conversation. It\u2019s harder than learning to walk.\nSuddenly so many things made sense. Of course Tempi wouldn\u2019t look me in the eye. There was nothing to be gained by looking at the face of the person you were talking to. You listen to the voice, but you watch the hand.\nI spent the next several hours attempting to learn the basics, but it was maddeningly difficult. Words are fairly simple things. You can point to a stone. You can act out running or jumping. But have you ever tried to pantomime compliance? Respect? Sarcasm? I doubt even my father could have accomplished such a thing.\nBecause of this my progress was frustratingly slow, but I couldn\u2019t help but be fascinated. It was like suddenly being given a second tongue.\nAnd it was a secret thing, of sorts. I have always had a weakness for secrets.\nIt took three hours to learn a handful of gestures, if you\u2019ll pardon the pun. My progress felt glacial, but when I finally learned the hand-speak for \u201cunderstatement\u201d I felt a glow of pride that can barely be described.\nI think Tempi felt it too. \u201cGood,\u201d he said with a flattening of the hand I was fairly certain indicated approval. He rolled his shoulders and got to his feet, stretching. He glanced at the sun through the branches overhead. \u201cFood now?\u201d\n\u201cSoon.\u201d There was one question that had been bothering me. \u201cTempi, why make all this work?\u201d I asked. \u201cA smile is easy. Why smile with your hands?\u201d\n\u201cWith hands is easy too. Better. More . . .\u201d He made a slightly modified version of the shirt-brushing gesture he\u2019d used earlier. Not disgust, irritation? \u201cWhat is the word for people living together. Roads. Right things.\u201d He ran his thumb along his collarbone, was that frustration? \u201cWhat is word for good together living? Nobody shits in the well.\u201d\nI laughed. \u201cCivilization?\u201d\nHe nodded, splaying his fingers: amusement. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cSpeaking with hands is civilization.\u201d\n\u201cBut smiling is natural,\u201d I protested. \u201cEveryone smiles.\u201d\n\u201cNatural is not civilization,\u201d Tempi said. \u201cCooking meat is civilization. Washing off stink is civilization.\u201d", "\u201cSo in Ademre you always smile with hands?\u201d I wished I knew the gesture for dismay.\n\u201cNo. Smiling with face good with family. Good with some friend.\u201d \u201cWhy only family?\u201d\nTempi repeated his thumb-on-collarbone gesture again. \u201cWhen you make\nthis.\u201d He pressed his palm to the side of his face and blew air into it, making a great flatulent noise. \u201cThat is natural, but you do not make it near others. Rude. With family . . .\u201d He shrugged. Amusement. \u201c. . . civilization not important. More natural with family.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about laughing?\u201d I asked. \u201cI have seen you laugh.\u201d I made a ha-ha sound so he knew what I was talking about.\nHe shrugged. \u201cLaughing is.\u201d\nI waited for a moment, but he didn\u2019t seem inclined to continue. I tried again. \u201cWhy not laugh with hands?\u201d\nTempi shook his head. \u201cNo. Laugh is different.\u201d He stepped close and used two fingers to tap my chest over my heart. \u201cSmile?\u201d He ran his finger down my left arm. \u201cAngry?\u201d He tapped my heart again. He made a scared expression, a confused one, and poked his lip out in a ridiculous pout. Each time he tapped my chest.\n\u201cBut laugh?\u201d He pressed the flat of his hand against my stomach. \u201cHere lives laugh.\u201d He ran his finger straight up to my mouth and spread his fingers. \u201cPush back laugh is not good. Not healthy.\u201d\n\u201cAlso cry?\u201d I asked. I traced an imaginary tear down my cheek with one finger.\n\u201cAlso cry.\u201d He put his hand on his own belly. \u201cHa ha ha,\u201d he said, pressing in with his hand to show me the motion of his stomach. Then his expression changed to sad. \u201cHuh huh huh,\u201d he heaved with exaggerated sobs, pressing his stomach again. \u201cSame place. Not healthy to push down.\u201d\nI nodded slowly, trying to imagine what it must be like for Tempi, constantly assaulted by people too rude to keep their expressions to themselves. People whose hands constantly made gestures that were nonsense. \u201cIt must be very hard for you, out here.\u201d\n\u201cNot so hard.\u201d Understatement. \u201cWhen I leave Ademre, I know this. Not civilization. Barbarians are rude.\u201d\n\u201cBarbarians?\u201d\nHe made a wide gesture, encompassing our clearing, the forest, all of Vintas. \u201cEveryone here like dogs.\u201d He made a grotesquely exaggerated", "expression of rage, showing all his teeth, snarling and rolling his eyes madly. \u201cThat is all you know.\u201d He shrugged nonchalant acceptance, as if to say he didn\u2019t hold it against us.\n\u201cWhat of children?\u201d I asked. \u201cChildren smile before they talk. Is that wrong?\u201d\nTempi shook his head. \u201cAll children barbarians. All smile with face. All children rude. But they go old. Watch. Learn.\u201d He paused thoughtfully. Choosing his words. \u201cBarbarians have no woman to teach them civilization. Barbarians cannot learn.\u201d\nI could tell he didn\u2019t mean any offense, but it made me more determined than ever to learn the particulars of the Adem hand-talk.\nTempi stood and began limbering up with a number of stretches similar to those the tumblers used in my troupe when I was young. After fifteen minutes of twisting himself this way and that, he began his slow, dancelike pantomime. Though I didn\u2019t know it at the time, it was called the Ketan.\nStill nettled about Tempi\u2019s \u201cbarbarians cannot learn\u201d comment, I decided I would follow along. After all, I didn\u2019t have anything better to do.\nAs I tried to mimic him, I became aware of how devilishly complex it was: keeping the hands cupped just so, the feet correctly positioned. Despite the fact that Tempi moved with almost glacial slowness, I found it impossible to imitate his smooth grace. Tempi never paused or looked in my direction. He never offered a word of encouragement or advice.\nIt was exhausting, and I was glad when it was over. Then I started the fire and lashed together a tripod. Wordlessly, Tempi brought out a hard sausage and several potatoes that he began to peel carefully using his sword.\nI was surprised by this, as Tempi fussed over his sword much the same way I did with my lute. Once when Dedan had picked it up, the Adem had responded with a rather dramatic emotional outburst. Dramatic for Tempi, that is. He\u2019d spoken two full sentences and frowned a bit.\nTempi saw me watching him and cocked his head curiously.\nI pointed. \u201cSword?\u201d I asked. \u201cFor cutting potatoes?\u201d\nTempi looked down at the half-peeled potato in one hand, his sword in\nanother. \u201cIs sharp.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIs clean.\u201d\nI returned the shrug, not wanting to make an issue of it. While working\ntogether, I learned the words for iron, knot, leaf, spark, and salt.\nWaiting for the water to boil, Tempi stood, shook himself, and began his\nlimbering stretches a second time. I followed him again. It was harder this", "time. The muscles of my arms and legs were loose and shaky from my previous effort. Toward the end I had to fight to keep myself from trembling, but I gleaned a few more secrets.\nTempi continued to ignore me, but I didn\u2019t mind. I\u2019ve always been drawn to a challenge.", ""], "CHAPTER EIGHTY-THREE": ["CHAPTER EIGHTY-THREE\nLack of Sight\n\u201c. . . SO TABORLIN WAS PRISONED deep underground,\u201d Marten said. \u201cThey had left him with nothing but the clothes upon his back and an inch of guttering candle to push away the darkness.\n\u201cThe sorcerer-king planned to leave Taborlin trapped until hunger and thirst weakened his will. Scyphus knew if Taborlin swore to help him, the wizard would abide by his promise, because Taborlin never broke his word.\n\u201cWorst of all, Scyphus had taken Taborlin\u2019s staff and sword, and without them his power was all dim and guttery. He\u2019d even taken Taborlin\u2019s cloak of no particular color, but he warc\u2014sorry. But\u2014achhm. Hespe, would you be a darling and pass me the skin?\u201d\nHespe tossed Marten the waterskin and he took a deep drink. \u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cWhere was I again?\u201d\nWe had been in the Eld for twelve days, and things had fallen into a steady rhythm. Marten had changed our standing wager to reflect our growing skill. First to ten to one, then fifteen to one, which was the same arrangement he had with Dedan and Hespe.\nMy understanding of the Adem hand-language was growing, and as a result, Tempi was becoming something other than a frustrating blank page of a man. As I learned to read his body language, he was slowly being colored in around the edges.\nHe was thoughtful and gentle. Dedan rubbed him the wrong way. He loved jokes, though many of mine fell flat, and the ones he tried to tell invariably made no sense in translation.\nThis isn\u2019t to say things were perfect between us. I still offended Tempi occasionally, making social gaffes I couldn\u2019t understand even after the fact. Every day I continued to follow him in his strange dance, and every day he pointedly ignored me.\n\u201cNow Taborlin needed to escape,\u201d Marten said, continuing his story. \u201cBut when he looked around his cave, he saw no door. No windows. All around", "him was nothing but smooth, hard stone.\n\u201cBut Taborlin the Great knew the names of all things, so all things were his\nto command. He said to the stone: \u2018break!\u2019 and the stone broke. The wall tore like a piece of paper, and through that hole Taborlin could see the sky and breathe the sweet spring air.\n\u201cTaborlin made his way out of the caves, into the castle, and finally to the doors of the royal hall itself. The doors were barred against him, so he said, 'burn!\u2019 and they burst into flame and were soon nothing more than fine grey ash.\n\u201cTaborlin stepped into the hall and saw King Scyphus sitting there with fifty guards. The king said, \u2018Capture him!\u2019 But the guards had just seen the doors burn to ash, so they moved closer, but none of them came too close, if you know what I mean.\n\u201cKing Scyphus said, 'Cowards! I will battle Taborlin with wizardry and best him!\u2019 He was afraid of Taborlin too, but he hid it well. Besides, Scyphus had his staff, and Taborlin had none.\n\u201cThen Taborlin said, \u2018If you\u2019re so brave, give me my staff before we duel.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Certainly,\u2019 Scyphus said, even though he didn\u2019t really mean to give it back, you see. \u2018It\u2019s right next to you in that chest there.\u2019 \u201d\nMarten looked around at us conspiratorially. \u201cYou see, Scyphus knew the chest was locked and had only one key. And that key was right in his pocket. So Taborlin went over to the chest, but it was locked. Then Scyphus laughed and so did a few of the guards.\n\u201cThat made Taborlin angry. And before any of them could do anything he struck the top of the chest with his hand and shouted, 'Edro!\u2019 The chest sprung open and he grabbed his cloak of no particular color, wrapping it around himself.\u201d\nMarten cleared his throat again. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d he said, and paused to take another long drink.\nHespe turned to Dedan. \u201cWhat color do you think Taborlin\u2019s cloak was?\u201d\nDedan\u2019s forehead creased a bit, almost like the beginning of a scowl. \u201cWhat do you mean? It\u2019s no particular color, just like it says.\u201d\nHespe\u2019s mouth went flat. \u201cI know that. But when you think of it in your head, what does it look like? You have to picture it as looking like something, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nDedan looked thoughtful for a moment. \u201cI always pictured it as kind of shimmery,\u201d he said. \u201cLike the cobblestones outside a tallow-works after a", "hard rain.\u201d\n\u201cI always thought of it as a dirty grey,\u201d she said. \u201cSort of washed out from\nhis being on the road all the time.\u201d\n\u201cThat makes good sense,\u201d Dedan said, and I watched Hespe\u2019s face go\ngentle again.\n\u201cWhite,\u201d Tempi volunteered. \u201cI think white. No color.\u201d\n\u201cI always thought of it as kind of a pale sky-blue,\u201d Marten admitted,\nshrugging. \u201cI know that doesn\u2019t make any sense. That\u2019s just how I picture it.\u201d Everyone turned to look at me.\n\u201cSometimes I think of it like a quilt,\u201d I said. \u201cMade entirely out of\npatchwork, a bunch of different colored rags and scraps. But most of the time I think of it as dark. Like it really is a color, but it\u2019s too dark for anyone to see.\u201d\nWhen I was younger, stories of Taborlin had left me wide-eyed with wonder. Now that I knew the truth about magic, I enjoyed them on a different level, somewhere between nostalgia and amusement.\nBut I held a special place in my heart for Taborlin\u2019s cloak of no particular color. His staff held much of his power. His sword was deadly. His key, coin, and candle were valuable tools. But the cloak was at the heart of Taborlin. It was a disguise when he needed it, helped him hide when he was in trouble. It protected him. From rain. From arrows. From fire.\nHe could hide things in it, and it had many pockets full of wonderful things. A knife. A toy for a child. A flower for a lady. Whatever Taborlin needed was somewhere in his cloak of no particular color. These stories are what made me beg my mother for my first cloak when I was young. . . .\nI drew my own cloak around me. My nasty, tatty, faded cloak the tinker had traded me. On one of our trips into Crosson for supplies, I\u2019d picked up some spare cloth and sewn a few clumsy pockets into the inside. But it was still a poor replacement for my rich burgundy cloak, or the lovely black and green one Fela had made for me.\nMarten cleared his throat again and launched back into his story. \u201cSo Taborlin struck the trunk with his hand and shouted. 'Edro!\u2019 The lid of the chest popped open, and he grabbed his cloak of no particular color and his staff. He called forth great barbs of lightning and killed twenty guards. Then he called forth a sheet of fire and killed another twenty. Those that were left threw down their swords and cried for mercy.\n\u201cThen Taborlin gathered up the rest of his things from the chest. He took", "out his key and coin and tucked them safe away. Lastly he brought out his copper sword, Skyaldrin, and belted\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Dedan interrupted, laughing. \u201cYou tit. Taborlin\u2019s sword wasn\u2019t copper.\u201d\n\u201cShut up, Den,\u201d Marten snapped, nettled at the interruption. \u201cIt was so copper.\u201d\n\u201cYou shut up,\u201d Dedan replied. \u201cWho\u2019s ever heard of a copper sword? Copper wouldn\u2019t hold an edge. It\u2019d be like trying to kill someone with a big penny.\u201d\nHespe laughed at that. \u201cIt was probably a silver sword, don\u2019t you think, Marten?\u201d\n\u201cIt was a copper sword,\u201d Marten insisted.\n\u201cMaybe it was early on in his career,\u201d Dedan said in a loud whisper to Hespe. \u201cAll he could afford was a copper sword.\u201d\nMarten shot the two of them an angry look. \u201cCopper, damn you. If you don\u2019t like it, you can just guess at the ending.\u201d He folded his arms in front of himself.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Dedan said. \u201cKvothe can give us one. He might be a pup, but he knows how to tell a proper story. Copper sword my ass.\u201d\n\u201cActually,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019d like to hear the end of Marten\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cOh go ahead,\u201d the old tracker said bitterly. \u201cI\u2019m in no mood to finish now. And I\u2019d rather listen to you than hear that donkey he-yaw his way through one of his.\u201d\nNightly stories had been one of the few times we could sit as a group without falling into petty bickering. Now, even they were becoming tense. What\u2019s more, the others were beginning to count on me for the evening\u2019s entertainment. Hoping to put an end to the trend, I\u2019d put a lot of thought into what story I was going to tell tonight.\n\u201cOnce upon a time,\u201d I began. \u201cThere was a little boy born in a little town. He was perfect, or so his mother thought. But one thing was different about him. He had a gold screw in his belly button. Just the head of it peeping out.\n\u201cNow his mother was simply glad he had all his fingers and toes to count with. But as the boy grew up he realized not everyone had screws in their belly buttons, let alone gold ones. He asked his mother what it was for, but she didn\u2019t know. Next he asked his father, but his father didn\u2019t know. He asked his grandparents, but they didn\u2019t know either.\n\u201cThat settled it for a while, but it kept nagging him. Finally, when he was", "old enough, he packed a bag and set out, hoping he could find someone who knew the truth of it.\n\u201cHe went from place to place, asking everyone who claimed to know something about anything. He asked midwives and physickers, but they couldn\u2019t make heads or tails of it. The boy asked arcanists, tinkers, and old hermits living in the woods, but no one had ever seen anything like it.\n\u201cHe went to ask the Cealdim merchants, thinking if anyone would know about gold, it would be them. But the Cealdim merchants didn\u2019t know. He went to the arcanists at the University, thinking if anyone would know about screws and their workings, they would. But the arcanists didn\u2019t know. The boy followed the road over the Stormwal to ask the witch women of the Tahl, but none of them could give him an answer.\n\u201cEventually he went to the King of Vint, the richest king in the world. But the king didn\u2019t know. He went to the Emperor of Atur, but even with all his power, the emperor didn\u2019t know. He went to each of the small kingdoms, one by one, but no one could tell him anything.\n\u201cFinally the boy went to the High King of Modeg, the wisest of all the kings in the world. The high king looked closely at the head of the golden screw peeping from the boy\u2019s belly button. Then the high king made a gesture, and his seneschal brought out a pillow of golden silk. On that pillow was a golden box. The high king took a golden key from around his neck, opened the box, and inside was a golden screwdriver.\n\u201cThe high king took the screwdriver and motioned the boy to come closer. Trembling with excitement, the boy did. Then the high king took the golden screwdriver and put it in the boy\u2019s belly button.\u201d\nI paused to take a long drink of water. I could feel my small audience leaning toward me. \u201cThen the high king carefully turned the golden screw. Once: Nothing. Twice: Nothing. Then he turned it the third time, and the boy\u2019s ass fell off.\u201d\nThere was a moment of stunned silence.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Hespe asked incredulously.\n\u201cHis ass fell off,\u201d I repeated with an absolutely straight face.\nThere was a long silence. Everyone\u2019s eyes were fixed on me. The fire\nsnapped, sending a red ember floating upward.\n\u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d Hespe finally asked.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s it. The end.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she said again, more loudly. \u201cWhat kind of story is that?\u201d", "I was about to respond when Tempi burst out laughing. And he kept laughing; great shaking laughs that left him breathless. Soon I began to laugh as well, partly at Tempi\u2019s display, and partly because I\u2019d always considered it an oddly funny story myself.\nHespe\u2019s expression turned dangerous, as if she were the butt of the joke.\nDedan was the first to speak. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Why did . . .?\u201d he trailed off.\n\u201cDid they get the boy\u2019s ass back on?\u201d Hespe interjected.\nI shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s not part of the story.\u201d\nDedan gestured wildly, his expression frustrated. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of it?\u201d I put on an innocent face. \u201cI thought we were just telling stories.\u201d\nThe big man scowled at me. \u201cSensible stories! Stories with endings. Not\nstories that just have a boy\u2019s ass . . .\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThis is ridiculous. I\u2019m going to sleep.\u201d He moved off to make his bed. Hespe stalked off in her own direction.\nI smiled, reasonably sure neither one of them would be troubling me for any more stories than I cared to tell.\nTempi got to his feet as well. Then, as he walked past me he smiled and gave me a sudden hug. A span of days ago this would have shocked me, but now I knew that physical contact was not particularly odd among the Adem.\nStill, I was surprised he did it in front of the others. I returned his hug as best I could, feeling his chest still shaking with laughter. \u201cHis ass off,\u201d he said quietly, then made his way to bed.\nMarten\u2019s eyes followed Tempi, then he gave me a long, speculative look. \u201cWhere did you hear that one?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cMy father told it to me when I was young,\u201d I said honestly.\n\u201cOdd story to tell a child.\u201d\n\u201cI was an odd child,\u201d I said. \u201cWhen I was older he confessed he made the\nstories up to keep me quiet. I used to pepper him with questions. Hour after hour. He said the only thing that would keep me quiet was some sort of puzzle. But I cracked riddles like walnuts, and he ran out of those.\u201d\nI shrugged and started to lay out my bed. \u201cSo he made up stories that seemed like puzzles and asked me if I understood what they meant.\u201d I smiled a little wistfully. \u201cI remember thinking about that boy with the screw in his belly button for days and days, trying to find the sense in it.\u201d\nMarten frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s a cruel trick to play on a boy.\u201d The comment surprised me. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d", "\u201cTricking you just to get a little peace and quiet. It\u2019s a shabby thing to do.\u201d\nI was taken aback. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t done in meanness. I enjoyed it. It gave me something to think about.\u201d\n\u201cBut it was pointless. Impossible.\u201d\n\u201cNot pointless.\u201d I protested. \u201cIt\u2019s the questions we can\u2019t answer that teach us the most. They teach us how to think. If you give a man an answer, all he gains is a little fact. But give him a question and he\u2019ll look for his own answers.\u201d\nI spread my blanket on the ground and folded over the threadbare tinker\u2019s cloak to wrap myself in. \u201cThat way, when he finds the answers, they\u2019ll be precious to him. The harder the question, the harder we hunt. The harder we hunt, the more we learn. An impossible question . . .\u201d\nI trailed off as realization burst onto me. Elodin. That is what Elodin had been doing. Everything he\u2019d done in his class. The games, the hints, the cryptic riddling. They were all questions of a sort.\nMarten shook his head and wandered off, but I was lost in my thoughts and hardly noticed. I had wanted answers, and in spite of all I had thought, Elodin had been trying to give them to me. What I had taken as a malicious crypticism on his part was actually a persistent urging toward the truth. I sat there, silent and stunned by the scope of his instruction. By my lack of understanding. My lack of sight.", ""], "CHAPTER EIGHTY-FOUR": ["CHAPTER EIGHTY-FOUR\nThe Edge of the Map\nWE CONTINUED TO INCH our way through the Eld. Every day began with the hope of finding traces of a trail. Every night ended with disappointment.\nThe shine was definitely off the apple, and our group was slowly being overtaken by irritation and backbiting. Any fear Dedan once felt for me had worn paper-thin, and he pushed at me constantly. He wanted to buy a bottle of brand using the Maer\u2019s purse. I refused. He thought we didn\u2019t need to keep nightly watches, merely set up a tripline. I disagreed.\nEvery small battle I won made him resent me more. And his low grumbling steadily increased as our search wore on. It was never anything so bold as a direct confrontation, just a sporadic peppering of snide comments and sulky insubordination.\nOn the other hand, Tempi and I were slowly moving toward something like friendship. His Aturan was becoming better, and my Ademic had progressed to the point where I could actually be considered inarticulate, as opposed to just confusing.\nI continued to mimic Tempi as he performed his dance, and he continued to ignore me. Now that I\u2019d been doing it for a while, I recognized a hint of martial flavor to it. A slow motion with one arm gave the impression of a punch, a glacial raising of the foot resembled a kick. My arms and legs no longer shook from the effort of moving slowly along with him, but I was still irritated by how clumsy I was. I hate nothing so much as doing a thing badly.\nFor example, there was a portion halfway through that looked easy as breathing. Tempi turned, circled his arms, and took a small step. But whenever I tried to do the same, I inevitably found myself stumbling. I had tried a half-dozen different ways of placing my feet, but nothing made any difference.\nBut the day after I told my \u201cloose screw\u201d story, as Dedan eventually came to refer to it, Tempi stopped ignoring me. This time after I stumbled, he stopped and faced me. His fingers flicked: Disapproval, irritation. \u201cGo", "back,\u201d he said settling into the dance position that came before my stumble. I went into the same position and tried to mimic him. I lost my balance\nagain, and had to shuffle my feet to keep from stumbling. \u201cMy feet are stupid,\u201d I muttered in Ademic, curling the fingers on my left hand: Embarrassment.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Tempi grabbed my hips in his hands and twisted them. Then he pushed my shoulders back, and slapped at my knee, making me bend it. \u201cYes.\u201d\nI tried moving forward again, and felt the difference. I still lost my balance, but only a little.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said again. \u201cWatch.\u201d He tapped his shoulder. \u201cThis.\u201d He stood directly in front of me, barely a foot away, and repeated the motion. He turned, his hands made a circle to the side, and his shoulder pushed into my chest. It was the same motion you would make if you were trying to push open a door with your shoulder.\nTempi wasn\u2019t moving very quickly, but his shoulder pushed me firmly aside. It wasn\u2019t rough or sudden, but the force of it was irresistible, like when a horse brushes up against you on a crowded street.\nI moved through it again, focusing on my shoulder. I didn\u2019t stumble.\nSince we were the only ones at the camp, I kept the smile from my face and gestured: Happiness. \u201cThank you.\u201d Understatement.\nTempi said nothing. His face was blank, his hands still. He merely went back to where he had stood before and began his dance again from the beginning, facing away from me.\nI tried to remain stoic about the exchange, but I took this as a great compliment. Had I known more about the Adem, I would have realized it was far more than that.\nTempi and I came over a rise to find Marten waiting for us. It was too early for lunch, so hope rose in my chest as I thought that finally, after all these long days of searching, he might have caught the bandits\u2019 trail.\n\u201cI wanted to show you this,\u201d Marten said, gesturing to a tall, sprawling, fernlike plant that stood a dozen feet away. \u201cA bit of a rare thing. Been years since I\u2019ve seen one.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s called An\u2019s blade,\u201d he said proudly, looking it over. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to keep an eye out. Not many folk know about them so it might give us a clue if there are any more of them about.\u201d\nMarten looked back and forth between us eagerly. \u201cWell?\u201d he said at last. \u201cWhat\u2019s so special about it?\u201d I asked dutifully.\nMarten smiled. \u201cThe An\u2019s blade is interesting because it can\u2019t tolerate\nfolk,\u201d he said. \u201cIf any part of it touches your skin, it\u2019ll turn red as fall leaves in a couple hours. Redder than that. Bright as your mercenary reds,\u201d Marten gestured to Tempi. \u201cAnd then that whole plant will dry up and die.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d I asked, no longer having to feign interest.\nMarten nodded. \u201cA drop of sweat will kill it just the same. Which means most times it will die just from touching a person\u2019s clothes. Armor too. Or a stick you\u2019ve been holding. Or a sword.\u201d He gestured to Tempi\u2019s hip. \u201cSome people say it will die if you so much as breathe on it,\u201d Marten said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the truth.\u201d\nMarten turned to lead us away from the An\u2019s blade. \u201cThis is an old, old piece of forest. You don\u2019t see the blade anywhere near where folk have settled. We\u2019re off the edge of the map here.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re hardly on the edge of the map,\u201d I said. \u201cWe know exactly where we are.\u201d\nMarten snorted. \u201cMaps don\u2019t just have outside edges. They have inside edges. Holes. Folk like to pretend they know everything about the world. Rich folk especially. Maps are great for that. On this side of the line is Baron Taxtwice\u2019s field, on that side is Count Uptemuny\u2019s land.\u201d\nMarten spat. \u201cYou can\u2019t have blanks on your maps, so the folks who draw them shade in a piece and write, \u2018The Eld.\u2019 \u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou might as well burn a hole right through the map for what good that does. This forest is big as Vintas. Nobody owns it. You head off in the wrong direction in here, you\u2019ll walk a hundred miles and never see a road, let alone a house or plowed field. There are places around here that have never felt the press of a man\u2019s foot or heard the sound of his voice.\u201d\nI looked around. \u201cIt looks the same as most other forests I\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\u201cA wolf looks like a dog,\u201d Marten said simply.\u201cBut it\u2019s not. A dog is . . .\u201d He paused. \u201cWhat\u2019s that word for animals that are around people all the time? Cows and sheep and such.\u201d\n\u201cDomesticated?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he said, looking around. \u201cA farm is domesticated. A garden. A park. Most forests too. Folks hunt mushrooms, or cut firewood, or take their sweethearts for a little rub and cuddle.\u201d\nHe shook his head and reached out to touch the rough bark of a nearby tree. The gesture was oddly gentle, almost loving. \u201cNot this place. This place is old and wild. It doesn\u2019t care one thin sliver of a damn about us. If these folk we\u2019re hunting get the jump on us, they won\u2019t even have to bury our bodies. We\u2019ll lie on the ground for a hundred years and no one will come close to stumbling on our bones.\u201d\nI turned where I stood, looking at the rise and fall of the land. The worn rocks, the endless ranks of trees. I tried not to think about how the Maer had sent me here, like moving a stone on a tak board. He had sent me to a hole in the map. A place where no one would ever find my bones.", ""], "CHAPTER EIGHTY-FIVE": ["CHAPTER EIGHTY-FIVE\nInterlude\u2014Fences\nKVOTHE SAT UPRIGHT IN his seat, craning his neck to get a better look out the window. He was just holding his hand up to Chronicler when they heard a quick, light tapping on the wooden landing outside. Too fast and soft to be the heavy boots of farmers, it was followed by a high peal of childish laughter.\nChronicler quickly blotted the page he was writing, then tucked it under a stack of blank paper as Kvothe got to his feet and walked toward the bar. Bast leaned back, tipping his chair onto two legs.\nAfter a moment, the door opened and a young man with broad shoulders and a thin beard stepped into the inn, carefully ushering a little blonde girl through the doorway ahead of him. Behind him a young woman carried a baby boy sitting on her arm.\nThe innkeeper smiled, raising a hand. \u201cMary! Hap!\u201d\nThe young couple exchanged a brief word before the tall farmer walked over to Chronicler, still gently ushering the little girl in front of him. Bast got to his feet and offered up his chair to Hap.\nMary approached the bar, casually untangling one of the little boy\u2019s hands from her hair. She was young and pretty, with a smiling mouth and tired eyes. \u201cHello Kote.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you two in a long while,\u201d the innkeeper said. \u201cCan I get you some cider? I pressed it fresh this morning.\u201d\nShe nodded, and the innkeeper poured three mugs. Bast carried two over to Hap and his daughter. Hap took his, but the little girl hid behind her father, peering shyly around his shoulder.\n\u201cWould young master Ben like his own cup?\u201d Kote asked.\n\u201cHe would,\u201d Mary said, smiling at the boy as he chewed on his fingers. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t give it to him unless you\u2019re eager to clean the floors.\u201d She reached into her pocket.\nKote shook his head firmly, holding up a hand. \u201cI won\u2019t hear of it,\u201d he", "said. \u201cHap didn\u2019t take half of what the work was worth when he fixed my fences out back.\u201d\nMary smiled a tired, anxious smile and picked up her mug. \u201cThank you kindly, Kote.\u201d She walked over to where her husband sat, talking to Chronicler. She spoke to the scribe, swaying gently back and forth, bouncing the baby on one hip. Her husband nodded along, occasionally interjecting a word or two. Chronicler dipped his pen and began to write.\nBast moved back to the bar and leaned against it, eyeing the far table curiously. \u201cI still don\u2019t understand all of this,\u201d he said. \u201cI know for a fact Mary can write. She\u2019s sent me letters.\u201d\nKvothe looked curiously at his student, then shrugged. \u201cI expect he\u2019s writing wills and dispositions, not letters. You want that sort of thing done in a clear hand, spelled properly and with no confusion.\u201d He motioned to where Chronicler was pressing a heavy seal onto a sheet of paper. \u201cSee? That shows he\u2019s a court official. Everything he witnesses has legal weight.\u201d\n\u201cBut the priest does that,\u201d Bast said. \u201cAbbe Grimes is all sorts of official. He writes the marriage records and the deed when someone buys a plot of land. You said yourself, they love their records.\u201d\nKvothe nodded. \u201cTrue, but a priest likes it when you leave money to the church. If he writes up your will and you don\u2019t give the church as much as a bent penny . . .\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThat can make life hard in a little town like this. And if you can\u2019t read . . . well, then the priest can write down whatever he wants, can\u2019t he? And who\u2019s to argue with him after you\u2019re dead?\u201d\nBast looked shocked. \u201cAbbe Grimes wouldn\u2019t do something like that!\u201d\n\u201cHe probably wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Kvothe conceded. \u201cGrimes is a decent sort for a priest. But maybe you want to leave a piece of land to the young widow down the lane and some money to her second son?\u201d Kvothe raised an eyebrow meaningfully. \u201cThat\u2019s the sort of thing a fellow doesn\u2019t care to have his priest writing down. Better to have that news come out after you\u2019re dead and buried deep.\u201d\nUnderstanding came into Bast\u2019s eyes and he looked at the young couple as if trying to guess what secrets they were trying to hide.\nKvothe pulled out a white cloth and began to polish the bar absentmindedly. \u201cMost times it\u2019s simpler than that. Some folk just want to leave Ellie the music box and not hear the other sisters wail about it for the next ten years.\u201d\n\u201cLike when the Widow Graden died?\u201d", "\u201cExactly like when Widow Graden died. You saw how that family tore itself up fighting over her things. Half of them still aren\u2019t on speaking terms.\u201d\nAcross the room, the little girl stepped close to her mother and tugged insistently on her dress. A moment later Mary came over to the bar with the little girl in tow. \u201cLittle Syl has to tend to her necessary,\u201d she said apologetically. \u201cCould we . . .?\u201d\nKote nodded and pointed to the door near the stairway.\nMary turned and held out the little boy to Bast. \u201cWould you mind?\u201d Moving mostly on reflex, Bast reached out with both hands to take hold of\nthe boy, then stood there awkwardly as Mary escorted her daughter away. The little boy looked around brightly, not sure what to make of this new\nsituation. Bast turned to face Kvothe, the baby held stiffly in front of himself. The child\u2019s expression slowly shifted from curious to uncertain to unhappy. Finally he began to make a soft, anxious noise. He looked as if he were thinking about whether or not he wanted to cry, and was slowly starting to realize that, yes, as a matter of fact, he probably did.\n\u201cOh for goodness sake, Bast,\u201d Kvothe said in an exasperated voice. \u201cHere.\u201d He stepped forward and took hold of the boy, sitting him on top of the bar and holding him steady with both hands.\nThe boy seemed happier there. He rubbed a curious hand on the smooth top of the bar, leaving a smudge. He looked at Bast and smiled. \u201cDog,\u201d he said.\n\u201cCharming,\u201d Bast said, his voice dry.\nLittle Ben began to chew on his fingers and looked around again, more purposefully this time. \u201cMam,\u201d he said. \u201cMamamama.\u201d Then he began to look concerned and make the same, low anxious noise as before.\n\u201cHold him up,\u201d Kvothe said, moving to stand directly in front of the little boy. Once Bast was steadying him, the innkeeper grabbed hold of the boy\u2019s feet and began a singsong chant.\nCobbler, cobbler, measure my feet. Farmer, farmer, plant some wheat. Baker, baker, bake me bread. Tailor, make a hat for my head.\nThe little boy watched as Kvothe made a different hand motion for each line, pretending to plant wheat and knead bread. By the final line the little", "boy was laughing a delighted, burbling laugh as he clapped his hands to his own head along with the red-haired man.\nMiller, keep your thumb off the scale. Milkmaid, milkmaid, fill your pail Potter, potter, spin a jug,\nBaby, give your daddy a hug!\nKvothe made no gesture for the last line, instead he tilted his head, eyeing Bast expectantly.\nBast merely stood there, confused. Then realization dawned on his face. \u201cReshi, how could you think that?\u201d he asked, his voice slightly offended. He pointed at the little boy. \u201cHe\u2019s blonde!\u201d\nLooking back and forth between the two men, the boy decided that he would, actually, like to have a bit of a cry. His face clouded over, and he began to wail.\n\u201cThis is your fault,\u201d Bast said flatly.\nKvothe picked the little boy up off the bar and jiggled him in a marginally successful attempt to calm him. A moment later when Mary came back into the taproom, the baby howled even louder and leaned toward her, reaching with both hands.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Kvothe said, sounding abashed.\nMary took him back and he went instantly quiet, tears still standing in his eyes. \u201cNone of yours,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s just mother-hungry lately.\u201d She touched her nose to his, smiling, and the baby gave another delighted, burbling laugh.\n\u201cHow much did you charge them?\u201d Kvothe asked as he walked back to Chronicler\u2019s table.\nChronicler shrugged. \u201cPenny and a half.\u201d\nKvothe paused in the act of sitting down. His eyes narrowed. \u201cThat won\u2019t cover the cost of your paper.\u201d\nChronicler asked. \u201cI have ears, don\u2019t I? The smith\u2019s prentice mentioned the Bentleys are on hard times. Even if he hadn\u2019t, I still have eyes. Fellow\u2019s got\n \nseams on both knees and boots worn nearly through. Little girl\u2019s dress is too short for her and half patches besides.\u201d\nKvothe nodded, his expression grim. \u201cTheir south field\u2019s been flooded out two years running. And they had both their goats die this spring. Even if these were good times it would be a bad year for them. With their new little boy . . .\u201d He drew a long breath and let it out in a long, pensive sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s the levy taxes. Two this year already.\u201d\n\u201cDo you want me to wreck the fence again, Reshi?\u201d Bast said eagerly.\n\u201cHush about that, Bast.\u201d A smile flickered around the edges of Kvothe\u2019s mouth. \u201cWe\u2019ll need something different this time.\u201d His smile faded. \u201cBefore the next levy.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe there won\u2019t be another,\u201d Chronicler said.\nKvothe shook his head. \u201cIt won\u2019t come until after the harvest, but it\u2019ll come. Regular taxmen are bad enough, but they know enough to occasionally look the other way. They know they\u2019ll be back next year, and the year after. But the bleeders . . .\u201d\nChronicler nodded. \u201cThey\u2019re different,\u201d he said grimly. Then recited, \u201c\u2018If they could, they\u2019d take the rain. If they can\u2019t get gold, they\u2019ll take the grain.\u2019 \u201d\nKvothe gave a thin smile and continued.\nIf you\u2019ve got no grain, they\u2019ll take your goat. They\u2019ll take your firewood and your coat.\nIf you\u2019ve a cat, they\u2019ll take your mouse.\nAnd in the end, they\u2019ll take your house.\n\u201cEveryone hates the bleeders,\u201d Chronicler agreed darkly. \u201cIf anything, the nobles hate them twice as much.\u201d\n\u201cI find that hard to believe,\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cYou should hear the talk around here. If the last one hadn\u2019t had a full armed guard, I don\u2019t think he would have made it out of town alive.\u201d\nChronicler gave a bent smile. \u201cYou should have heard the things my father used to call them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he\u2019d only had two levies in twenty years. He said he\u2019d rather have locusts followed by a fire than the king\u2019s bleeder moving through his lands.\u201d Chronicler glanced at the door of the inn. \u201cThey\u2019re too proud to ask for help?\u201d\n\u201cProuder than that,\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cThe poorer you are, the more your pride", "is worth. I know the feeling. I never could have asked a friend for money. I would have starved first.\u201d\n\u201cA loan?\u201d Chronicler asked.\n\u201cWho has money to lend these days?\u201d Kvothe asked grimly. \u201cIt\u2019s already going to be a hungry winter for most folk. But after a third levy tax the Bentleys will be sharing blankets and eating their seed grain before the snow thaws. That\u2019s if they don\u2019t lose their house as well. . . .\u201d\nThe innkeeper looked down at his hands on the table and seemed surprised that one of them was curled into a fist. He opened it slowly and spread both hands flat against the tabletop. Then he looked up at Chronicler, a rueful smile on his face. \u201cDid you know I never paid taxes before I came here? The Edema don\u2019t own property, as a rule.\u201d He gestured at the inn. \u201cI never understood how galling it was. Some smug bastard with a ledger comes into town, makes you pay for the privilege of owning something.\u201d\nKvothe gestured for Chronicler to pick up his pen. \u201cNow, of course, I understand the truth of things. I know what sort of dark desires lead a group of men to wait beside the road, killing tax collectors in open defiance of the king.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER EIGHTY-SIX": ["CHAPTER EIGHTY-SIX\nThe Broken Road\nWE FINISHED SEARCHING THE north side of the king\u2019s highway and started on the southern half. Often the only thing that marked one day from the next were the stories we told around the fire at night. Stories of Oren Velciter, Laniel Young-Again, and Illien. Stories of helpful swineherds and the luck of tinker\u2019s sons. Stories of demons and faeries, of riddle games and barrow draugs.\nThe Edema Ruh know all the stories in the world, and I am Edema down to the center of my bones. My parents told stories around the fire every night while I was young. I grew up watching stories in dumbshow, listening to them in songs, and acting them out on stage.\nGiven this, it was hardly surprising that I already knew the stories Dedan, Hespe, and Marten told at night. Not every detail, but I knew the bones of them. I knew their shapes and how they would end.\nDon\u2019t mistake me. I still enjoyed them. Stories don\u2019t need to be new to bring you joy. Some stories are like familiar friends. Some are dependable as bread.\nStill, a story I haven\u2019t heard before is a rare and precious thing. And after twenty days of searching the Eld, I was rewarded with one of those.\n\u201cOnce, long ago and far from here,\u201d Hespe said as we sat around the fire after dinner, \u201cthere was a boy named Jax, and he fell in love with the moon.\n\u201cJax was a strange boy. A thoughtful boy. A lonely boy. He lived in an old house at the end of a broken road. He\u2014\u201d\nDedan interrupted. \u201cDid you say a broken road?\u201d\nHespe\u2019s mouth went firm. She didn\u2019t scowl exactly, but it looked like she was getting all the pieces of a scowl together in one place, just in case she\n \nneeded them in a hurry. \u201cI did. A broken road. That\u2019s how my mother told this story a hundred times when I was little.\u201d\nFor a minute it looked like Dedan was going to ask another question. But instead he showed a rare foresight and simply nodded.\nHespe reluctantly put the pieces of her scowl away. Then she looked down at her hands, frowning. Her mouth moved silently for a moment, then she nodded to herself and continued.\nEveryone who saw Jax could tell there was something different about him. He didn\u2019t play. He didn\u2019t run around getting into trouble. And he never laughed.\nSome folk said, \u201cWhat can you expect of a boy who lives alone in a broken house at the end of a broken road?\u201d Some said the problem was that he never had any parents. Some said he had a drop of faerie blood in him and that kept his heart from ever knowing joy.\nHe was an unlucky boy. There was no denying that. When he got a new shirt, he would tear a hole in it. If you gave him a sweet, he would drop it in the road.\nSome said the boy was born under a bad star, that he was cursed, that he had a demon riding his shadow. Other folks simply felt bad for him, but not so bad that they cared to help.\nOne day, a tinker came down the road to Jax\u2019s house. This was something of a surprise, because the road was broken, so nobody ever used it.\n\u201cHoy there, boy!\u201d the tinker shouted, leaning on his stick. \u201cCan you give an old man a drink?\u201d\nJax brought out some water in a cracked clay mug. The tinker drank and looked down at the boy. \u201cYou don\u2019t look happy, son. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201cNothing is the matter,\u201d Jax said. \u201cIt seems to me a person needs something to be happy about, and I don\u2019t have any such thing.\u201d\nJax said this in a tone so flat and resigned that it broke the tinker\u2019s heart. \u201cI\u2019m betting I have something in my pack that will make you happy,\u201d he said to the boy. \u201cWhat do you say to that?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d say that if you make me happy, I\u2019ll be grateful indeed,\u201d Jax said. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t got any money to spend, not a penny to borrow to beg or to lend.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell that is a problem,\u201d said the tinker. \u201cI am in business, you see.\u201d\n\u201cIf you can find something in your pack that will make me happy,\u201d Jax said. \u201cI will give you my house. It\u2019s old and broken, but it\u2019s worth something.\u201d\nThe tinker looked up at the huge old house, one short step away from being a mansion. \u201cIt is at that,\u201d he said.\nThen Jax looked up at the tinker, his small face serious. \u201cAnd if you can\u2019t make me happy, what then? Will you give me the packs off your back, the stick in your hand, and the hat off your head?\u201d\nNow the tinker was fond of a wager, and he knew a good bet when he heard one. Besides, his packs were bulging with treasures from all over the Four Corners, and he was confident he could impress a small boy. So he agreed, and the two of them shook hands.\nFirst the tinker brought out a bag of marbles all the colors of sunlight. But they didn\u2019t make Jax happy. The tinker brought out a ball and cup. But that didn\u2019t make Jax happy.\n\u201cBall and cup doesn\u2019t make anyone happy,\u201d Marten muttered. \u201cThat\u2019s the worst toy ever. Nobody in their right mind enjoys ball and cup.\u201d\nThe tinker went through his first pack. It was full of ordinary things that would have pleased an ordinary boy: dice, puppets, a folding knife, a rubber ball. But nothing made Jax happy.\nSo the tinker moved on to his second pack. It held rarer things. A gear soldier that marched if you wound him. A bright set of paints with four different brushes. A book of secrets. A piece of iron that fell from the sky. . . .\nThis went on all day and late into the night, and eventually the tinker began to worry. He wasn\u2019t worried about losing his stick. But his packs were how he made his living, and he was rather fond of his hat.\nEventually, he realized he was going to have to open his third pack. It was small, and it only had three items in it. But they were things he only showed to his wealthiest customers. Each was worth much more than a broken house. But still, he thought, better to lose one than to lose everything and his hat besides.\nJust as the tinker was reaching for his third pack, Jax pointed. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\n\u201cThose are spectacles,\u201d the tinker said. \u201cThey\u2019re a second pair of eyes that help a person see better.\u201d He picked them up and settled them onto Jax\u2019s face.", "Jax looked around. \u201cThings look the same,\u201d he said. Then he looked up. \u201cWhat are those?\u201d\n\u201cThose are stars,\u201d the tinker said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen them before.\u201d He turned, still looking up. Then he stopped stock still. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\n\u201cThat is the moon,\u201d the tinker said.\n\u201cI think that would make me happy,\u201d Jax said.\n\u201cWell there you go,\u201d the tinker said, relieved. \u201cYou have your spectacles. .\n. .\u201d\n\u201cLooking at it doesn\u2019t make me happy,\u201d Jax said. \u201cNo more than looking\nat my dinner makes me full. I want it. I want to have it for my own.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t give you the moon,\u201d the tinker said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t belong to me.\nShe belongs only to herself.\u201d\n\u201cOnly the moon will do,\u201d Jax said.\n\u201cWell I can\u2019t help you with that,\u201d the tinker said with a heavy sigh. \u201cMy\npacks and everything in them are yours.\u201d\nJax nodded, unsmiling.\n\u201cAnd here\u2019s my stick. A good sturdy one it is, too.\u201d\nJax took it in his hand.\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose,\u201d the tinker said reluctantly, \u201cthat you\u2019d mind leaving me\nwith my hat? I\u2019m rather fond of it. . . .\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s mine by right,\u201d Jax said. \u201cIf you were fond of it, you shouldn\u2019t have\ngambled it away.\u201d The tinker scowled as he handed over his hat.\nTempi made a low noise in his throat and shook his head. Hespe smiled and nodded. Apparently even the Adem know it\u2019s bad luck to be rude to a tinker.\nSo Jax settled the hat on his head, took the stick in his hand, and gathered up the tinker\u2019s packs. When he found the third one, still unopened, he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s in here?\u201d\n\u201cSomething for you to choke on,\u201d the tinker spat.\n\u201cNo need to get tetchy over a hat,\u201d the boy said. \u201cI have greater need of it than you. I have a long way to walk if I\u2019m to find the moon and make her mine.\u201d\n\u201cBut for the taking of my hat, you could have had my help in catching her,\u201d the tinker said.\n\u201cI will leave you with the broken house,\u201d Jax said. \u201cThat is something. Though it will be up to you to mend it.\u201d", "Jax put the spectacles on his face and started walking down the road in the direction of the moon. He walked all night, only stopping when she went out of sight behind the mountains.\nSo Jax walked day after day, endlessly searching\u2014\nDedan snorted. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that sound just a little too familiar?\u201d he muttered loud enough for everyone to hear. \u201cI wonder if he was pissing his time up a tree like we are?\u201d\nHespe glared at him, the muscles in her jaw clenching.\nI gave a quiet sigh.\n\u201cAre you done?\u201d Hespe asked pointedly, glaring at Dedan for a long\nmoment.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Dedan asked.\n\u201cShut up while I\u2019m telling my story is what,\u201d Hespe said.\n\u201cEveryone else had their say!\u201d Dedan climbed to his feet, indignant. \u201cEven\nthe mute chimed in.\u201d He waved a hand at Tempi. \u201cHow come I\u2019m the only one you get hissy at?\u201d\nHespe seethed for a moment, then said. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to pick a fight halfway through my story is why.\u201d\n\u201cTellin\u2019 the truth isn\u2019t picking a fight,\u201d Dedan grumbled. \u201cSomeone needs to speak some sense around here.\u201d\nHespe threw her hands up in the air, \u201cYou\u2019re still doing it! Can\u2019t you set it down for one evening? Every chance you get you have to bitch and minge on!\u201d\n\u201cAt least when I don\u2019t agree I speak my mind,\u201d Dedan said. \u201cI don\u2019t take the coward\u2019s way out.\u201d\nHespe\u2019s eyes flashed, and despite my better judgment, I decided to jump in. \u201cFine,\u201d I interrupted, looking at Dedan. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a better idea for finding these folk, let\u2019s hear it. Let\u2019s talk it over like adults.\u201d\nMy interjection didn\u2019t slow Dedan down the least bit. It just pointed him in my direction. \u201cWhat would you know about adults?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of being talked down to by some boy who probably doesn\u2019t even have hair on his balls yet.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure if the Maer had known how hairy your balls were, he would have\n \nput you in charge,\u201d I said with what I hoped was infuriating calmness. \u201cUnfortunately, it seems he missed that fact and decided on me instead.\u201d\nDedan drew a breath, but Tempi broke in before he could start. \u201cBalls,\u201d the Adem said curiously. \u201cWhat is balls?\u201d\nAll the air went out of Dedan in a rush, and he turned to look at Tempi, half irritated, half amused. The big mercenary chuckled and made a very clear motion between his legs with a cupped hand. \u201cYou know. Balls,\u201d he said without a trace of self-consciousness.\nBehind his back, Hespe rolled her eyes, shaking her head.\n\u201cAh,\u201d Tempi said, nodding to show his understanding. \u201cWhy is the Maer looking at hairy balls?\u201d\nA pause, then a storm of laughter rolled through our camp, exploding with all the force of the pent-up tension that had been ready to boil into a fight. Hespe laughed herself breathless, clutching at her stomach. Marten wiped tears from his eyes. Dedan laughed so hard he couldn\u2019t stand upright and ended up crouching with one hand on the ground to steady himself.\nBy the end of it, everyone was sitting around the fire, breathing hard and grinning like silly idiots. The tension that had been thick as winter fog was gone for the first time in days. It was only then that Tempi briefly caught my eye. His thumb and forefinger rubbed together gently. Gladness? No. Satisfaction . Realization dawned on me as I met his eye again, his expression was blank as always. Studiously blank. So blank it was almost smug.\n\u201cCan we get back to your story, love?\u201d Dedan asked Hespe. \u201cI\u2019d like to know how this boy gets the moon into bed.\u201d\nHespe smiled at him, the first honest smile I\u2019d seen her give Dedan in a handful of days. \u201cI\u2019ve lost my place,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a rhythm to it, like a song. I can tell it from the beginning, but if I start halfway through I\u2019ll get it all tangled up in my head.\u201d\n\u201cWill you start over tomorrow if I promise to keep my mouth shut?\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d she agreed, \u201cif you promise.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER EIGHTY-SEVEN": ["CHAPTER EIGHTY-SEVEN\nThe Lethani\nTHE NEXT DAY TEMPI and I went to Crosson for supplies. It meant a long day of walking, but not having to look for trail sign every step of the way made it feel like we were flying down the road.\nAs we walked, Tempi and I traded words back and forth. I learned the word for dream, and smell, and bone. I learned there were different words in Ademic for iron and sword-iron.\nThen we had a long hour\u2019s worth of fruitless conversation as he tried to help me understand what it meant when he rubbed his fingers over his eyebrow. It almost seemed to be the same thing as a shrug, but he made it clear it wasn\u2019t the same. Was it indifference? Ambiguity?\n\u201cIs it the feeling you have when someone offers you a choice?\u201d I tried again. \u201cSomeone offers you an apple or a plum?\u201d I held up both hands in front of myself. \u201cBut you like both the same.\u201d I pressed my fingers together and smoothed them over my eyebrow twice. \u201cThis feeling?\u201d\nTempi shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d He stopped walking for a moment, then resumed. At his side, his left hand said: Dishonesty. \u201cWhat is plum?\u201d Attentive.\nConfused, I looked at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cWhat does plum mean?\u201d He gestured again: Profoundly serious. Attentive.\nI turned my attention to the trees and immediately heard it: movement in the undergrowth.\nThe noise came from the south side of the road. The side we hadn\u2019t searched yet. The bandits. Excitement and fear swelled in my chest. Would they attack us? In my tatty cloak I doubted I looked like much of a target, but I was carrying my lute in its dark, expensive case.\nTempi had changed back to his tight mercenary reds for the trip into town. Would that discourage a man with a longbow? Or would it seem I was a minstrel rich enough to hire an Adem bodyguard? We might look like fruit", "ripe for the picking.\nI thought longingly of the arrowcatch I\u2019d sold to Kilvin, and realized he\u2019d\nbeen right. People would pay dearly for them. I\u2019d give every penny in my pocket for one right now.\nI gestured to Tempi: Acceptance. Dishonesty. Agreement. \u201cA plum is a sweet fruit,\u201d I said, straining my ears for telltale sounds from the surrounding trees.\nShould we run to the trees for cover, or would it be better to pretend we were unaware of them? What could I do if they attacked? I had the knife I\u2019d bought from the tinker on my belt, but I had no idea how to use it. I was suddenly aware of how terribly unprepared I was. What in God\u2019s name was I doing out here? I didn\u2019t belong in this situation. Why had the Maer sent me?\nJust as I was starting to sweat in earnest, I heard a sudden snap and rustle in the underbrush. A horned hart burst from the trees and was across the road in three easy bounds. A moment later, two hinds followed. One paused in the center of the road and turned to look at us curiously, her long ear twitching. Then she was off and lost among the trees.\nMy heart was racing, and I let out a low, nervous laugh. I turned to look at Tempi, only to find him with his sword drawn. The fingers of his left hand curled into embarrassment, then made several quick gestures I couldn\u2019t identify.\nHe sheathed the sword without a flourish of any sort. A gesture as casual as putting your hand in your pocket. Frustration.\nI nodded. Glad as I was to not be sprouting arrows from my back, an ambush would at least have given us a clue as to where the bandits were. Agreement. Understatement.\nWe silently continued our walk toward Crosson.\nCrosson wasn\u2019t much as far as towns go. Twenty or thirty buildings with thick forest on every side. If it hadn\u2019t been on the king\u2019s highway, it probably wouldn\u2019t even have warranted a name.\nBut since it was on the king\u2019s highway, there was a reasonably stocked general goods store that supplied travelers and the scattering of nearby farms. There was a small post station that was also a livery and a farrier, and a small\n \nchurch that was also a brewery.\nAnd an inn, of course. While the Laughing Moon was barely a third the\nsize of the Pennysworth, it was still several steps above what you\u2019d expect for a town like this. It was two stories tall, with three private rooms and a bathhouse. A large handpainted sign showed a gibbous moon wearing a waistcoat, holding its belly while it rocked with laughter.\nI\u2019d brought my lute that morning, hoping I might be able to play in exchange for a bit of lunch. But that was just an excuse. I was desperate for any excuse to play. My enforced silence was wearing on me as much as Dedan\u2019s muttering. I hadn\u2019t gone so long without my music since I\u2019d been homeless on the streets of Tarbean.\nTempi and I dropped off our list of supplies with the elderly woman who ran the store. Four large loaves of trail bread, a half-pound of butter, quarterpound of salt, flour, dried apple, sausages, a side of bacon, a sack of turnips, six eggs, two buttons, feathers for refletching Marten\u2019s hunting arrows, bootlaces, soap, and a new whetstone to replace one Dedan had broken. All told, it would come to eight silver bits from the Maer\u2019s rapidly thinning purse.\nTempi and I made our way over to the inn for lunch, knowing it would be an hour or two before our order was ready. Surprisingly, I could hear noise from the taproom from across the street. Places like this were usually busy in the evening when travelers stopped for the night, not in the middle of the day when everyone was in the fields or on the road.\nThe room quieted when we opened the door. At first I hoped the customers were glad to see a musician, then I saw their eyes were all for Tempi in his tight mercenary reds.\nThere were fifteen or twenty people idling in the taproom. Some hunched at the bar, others clustered around tables. It wasn\u2019t so crowded we couldn\u2019t find a table to sit, but it did take a couple minutes before the single harassed- looking serving girl came to our table.\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll it be then?\u201d she asked, brushing a sweaty strand of hair away from her face. \u201cWe\u2019ve got pea soup with bacon in, and a bread pudding.\u201d\n\u201cSounds lovely,\u201d I said. \u201cCan we get some apples and cheese too?\u201d \u201cDrink?\u201d\n\u201cSoft cider for me,\u201d I said.\n\u201cBeer,\u201d Tempi said, then made a gesture with two fingers on the tabletop.\n\u201cSmall whiskey. Good whiskey.\u201d", "She nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll need to see your money.\u201d\nI raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019ve had trouble lately?\u201d\nShe sighed and rolled her eyes.\nI handed her three halfpennies, and she hurried off. By then I was sure I\nwasn\u2019t imagining it: the men in the room were giving Tempi dark looks.\nI turned to a man at the table next to us, quietly eating his bowl of soup. \u201cIs\nthis a market day or something?\u201d\nHe looked at me like I was an idiot, and I saw he had a bruise going purple\non his jaw. \u201cThere\u2019s no market day in Crosson. There\u2019s no market.\u201d\n\u201cI came through here a while back and things were quiet. What\u2019s everyone\ndoing here?\u201d\n\u201cSame thing as always,\u201d he said. \u201cLooking for work. Crosson is the last\nstop before the Eld gets good and thick. A smart caravan\u2019ll pick up an extra guard or two.\u201d He took a drink. \u201cBut too many folk been gettin\u2019 feathered off in the trees lately. Caravans aren\u2019t coming through so often.\u201d\nI looked around the room. They weren\u2019t wearing any armor, but now that I was looking I could see the marks of mercenary life on most of them. They were rougher looking than ordinary townsfolk. More scars, more broken noses, more knives, more swagger.\nThe man dropped his spoon into his empty bowl and got to his feet. \u201cYou can have the place for all I care,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ve been here six days and only seen four wagons come through. Besides, only an idiot would head north as a pay-a-day.\u201d\nHe picked up a large pack and slipped it over his shoulders. \u201cAnd with all the folk gone missing, only an idiot would take on extra help in a place like this. I\u2019ll tell you this for free, half of these reeking bastards would probably cut your throat the first night on the road.\u201d\nA broad-shouldered man with a wild black beard let loose a mocking laugh from where he stood at the bar. \u201cJust because yeh can\u2019t roll dice dinna make me a criminal, souee,\u201d he said with a thick northern accent. \u201cYeh say sommat like that agin and I\u2019ll give\u2019e twice as much as yeh got last night. Plus intrest.\u201d\nThe fellow I\u2019d been talking to made a gesture you didn\u2019t have to be Adem to understand and headed out the door. The bearded man laughed.\nOur drinks showed up just then. Tempi drank off half his whiskey in a single swallow and let out a long, satisfied sigh, slouching down in his seat. I sipped my cider. I\u2019d been hoping to play for an hour or two in exchange for our meal. But I wasn\u2019t fool enough to play to a room composed entirely of", "frustrated mercenaries.\nI could have done it, mind you. In an hour, I could have them laughing and\nsinging. In two hours I could have them crying into their beer and apologizing to the serving girl. But not for the price of a meal. Not unless I had no better options. This room reeked of trouble. It was a fight waiting to happen. No trouper worth his salt could fail to recognize that.\nThe broad-shouldered man picked up a wooden mug and sauntered with theatrical casualness over to our table where he pulled out a chair for himself. He smiled a wide, insincere smile through his thick black beard and stuck his hand out in Tempi\u2019s direction. \u201cHullo there,\u201d he said loud enough for everyone in the bar to hear. \u201cM\u2019 name\u2019s Tam. Yussef?\u201d\nTempi reached out and shook, his own hand looking small and pale gripped in the other man\u2019s huge hairy one. \u201cTempi.\u201d\nTam grinned at him. \u201cAnd what\u2019re yeh doin\u2019 in town?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re just passing through,\u201d I said. \u201cWe met up on the road and he was nice enough to walk with me.\u201d\nTam looked me up and down dismissively. \u201cI wan\u2019t talkin\u2019 to you, boy,\u201d he growled. \u201cMind yer betters.\u201d\nTempi remained silent, watching the big man with the same placid, attentive expression he always wore. I watched his left hand come up to his ear in a gesture I didn\u2019t recognize.\nTam took a drink, watching Tempi all the while. When he lowered his mug, the dark hair around his mouth was wet, and he wiped his forearm across his face to dry it. \u201cI\u2019ve always wonnert,\u201d he said, loud enough for it to carry through the whole room. \u201cYeh Adem. How much does one of yeh fancy lads make?\u201d\nTempi turned to look at me, his head tilted slightly to one side. I realized he probably couldn\u2019t understand the man\u2019s thick accent.\n\u201cHe wants to know how much money you earn,\u201d I explained.\nTempi made a wavering motion with one hand. \u201cComplicated.\u201d\nTam leaned over the table. \u201cWha if yeh were hired to guard a caravan?\nHow much would\u2019ee charge a day?\u201d\n\u201cTwo jots.\u201d Tempi shrugged. \u201cThree.\u201d\nTam gave a showy laugh, loud enough that I could smell his breath. I\u2019d\nexpected it to stink, but it didn\u2019t. It smelled like cider, sweet with mulling spices. \u201cYeh hear that boys?\u201d He shouted over his shoulder. \u201cThree jots a day. And he canna hardly talk!\u201d", "Most everyone was already watching and listening, and this piece of information brought a low, irritated murmur from the room.\nTam turned back to the table. \u201cMost of us get penny a day, when we get work at all. I get two, \u2019cause I\u2019m good with horses and can lift up the back of a wagon if I need to.\u201d He rolled his broad shoulders. \u201cAre yeh worth twenny men in a fight?\u201d\nI don\u2019t know how much of it Tempi understood, but he seemed to follow the last question fairly well. \u201cTwenty?\u201d he looked around appraisingly. \u201cNo. Four.\u201d He wavered his spread hand back and forth uncertainly. \u201cFive.\u201d\nThis did nothing to improve the atmosphere in the room. Tam shook his head in exaggerated bemusement. \u201cEven if I believed yeh for a second,\u201d he said, \u201cthat means yeh should make four or five pennies a day. Not twenny. Wh\u2014\u201d\nI put on my most ingratiating smile and leaned into the conversation. \u201cListen, I\u2014\u201d\nTam\u2019s mug knocked hard against the tabletop, sending a splash of cider leaping up into the air. He gave me a dangerous look that didn\u2019t hold any of the false playfulness he\u2019d been showing Tempi. \u201cBoy,\u201d he said. \u201cYeh innerupt me again, and I\u2019ll knock yer teeth right out.\u201d He said it without any particular emphasis, as if he were letting me know that if I jumped into the river, I was bound to get wet.\nTam turned back to Tempi. \u201cWhat makes you think you\u2019re worth three jots a day?\u201d\n\u201cWho buys me, buys this.\u201d Tempi held up his hand. \u201cAnd this.\u201d He pointed to the hilt of his sword. \u201cAnd this.\u201d He tapped a leather strap that bound his distinctive Adem reds tightly to his chest.\nThe big man slapped the table hard with the flat of his hand. \u201cSo tha\u2019s the secret!\u201d he said. \u201cI need to get me a red shirt!\u201d This brought a chuckle from the room.\nTempi shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d\nTam leaned forward, and flicked at one of the straps near Tempi\u2019s shoulder with a thick finger. \u201cAre yeh saying I\u2019m not good enough to wear a fancy red shirt like yours?\u201d He flicked the strap again.\nTempi nodded easily. \u201cYes. You are not good enough.\u201d\nTam grinned madly. \u201cWhat if I said yer mother was a whore?\u201d\nThe room grew quiet. Tempi turned to look at me. Curiosity. \u201cWhat is\nwhore?\u201d", "Unsurprisingly, that hadn\u2019t been one of the words we had shared over the last span of days. For half a moment I considered lying, but there was no way I could manage it. \u201cHe says your mother is a person men pay money to have sex with.\u201d\nTempi turned back to the mercenary and nodded graciously. \u201cYou are very kind. I thank you.\u201d\nTam\u2019s expression darkened, as if he suspected he was being mocked. \u201cYeh coward. For a bent penny I\u2019d give yeh such a kickin\u2019 you\u2019d be wearing your pecker backwards.\u201d\nTempi turned to me again. \u201cI do not understand this man,\u201d he said. \u201cIs he attempting to buy sex with me? Or does he wish to fight?\u201d\nLaughter roared through the room, and Tam\u2019s face grew red as blood under his beard.\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure he wants to fight,\u201d I said, trying to keep from laughing myself.\n\u201cAh,\u201d Tempi said. \u201cWhy does he not say? Why all of this . . .\u201d He flicked his fingers back and forth and gave me a quizzical look.\n\u201cPauncing around?\u201d I suggested. Tempi\u2019s confidence was having a relaxing effect on me, and I wasn\u2019t above getting a little dig of my own in. After seeing how easily the Adem had dealt with Dedan, I was looking forward to seeing him thump some of the arrogance out of this horse\u2019s ass.\nTempi looked back toward the big man. \u201cIf you wish to fight, now stop pauncing around.\u201d The Adem made a broad gesture to the rest of the room. \u201cGo find others to fight with you. Bring enough women to feel safe. Good?\u201d My brief moment of relaxation evaporated as Tempi turned back to me, exasperation thick in his voice. \u201cYou people are always talk.\u201d\nTam stomped back to the table where his friends sat throwing dice. \u201cArright now. Yeh heard him. The little gripshit says he\u2019s worth four of us, so let\u2019s show him the sort of damage four of us can do. Brenden, Ven, Jane, you in?\u201d\nA bald man and a tall woman came to their feet, smiling. But the third waved his hand dismissively. \u201cI\u2019m too drunk to fight proper, Tam. But that\u2019s not half as drunk as I\u2019d need to be to go up against a bloodshirt. They\u2019s bastards in a fight. I\u2019s seen it.\u201d\nI was no stranger to bar fights. You\u2019d think they\u2019d be rare in a place like the University, but liquor is the great leveler. After six or seven solid drinks, there is very little difference between a miller on the outs with his wife and a", "young alchemist who\u2019s done poorly on his exams. They\u2019re both equally eager to skin their knuckles on someone else\u2019s teeth.\nEven the Eolian, genteel as it was, saw its share of scuffles. If you stayed late enough you had a decent chance of seeing two of the embroidered nobility slapping away at each other.\nMy point is, when you\u2019re a musician you see a lot of fights. Some people go to the bars to drink. Some go to play dice. Some folk go looking for a fight, and others go hoping to watch a fight.\nFolk don\u2019t get hurt as much as you\u2019d expect. Bruises and split lips are usually the worst of it. If you\u2019re unlucky you might lose a tooth or break an arm, but there\u2019s a vast difference between a friendly bar fight and a back- alley koshing. A bar fight has rules and a host of unofficial judges standing around to enforce them. If things start to get vicious spectators are quick to leap in and break things up, because that\u2019s what you\u2019d want someone to do for you.\nThere are exceptions, of course. Accidents happen, and I knew all too well from my time at the Medica how easy it was to sprain a wrist or dislocate a finger. Those might be minor injuries to a cattle drover or an innkeeper, but to me, with so much of my livelihood relying on my clever hands, the thought of a broken thumb was terrifying.\nMy stomach knotted as I watched Tempi take another swallow of whiskey and get to his feet. The problem was that we were strangers here. If things got ugly, could I count on the irritated mercenaries to step in and put a stop to things? Three against one was nothing close to a fair fight, and if it got ugly it would get ugly fast.\nTempi took a mouthful of beer and looked at me calmly. \u201cWatch my back,\u201d he said, then turned to walk to where the other mercenaries stood.\nFor a moment I was simply impressed by his good use of Aturan. Since I\u2019d known him, he\u2019d gone from practically mute to using idiomatic speech. But that pride quickly faded as I tried to think of something I could do to stop the fight if things got out of control.\nI couldn\u2019t think of a blessed thing. I hadn\u2019t seen this coming, and I had no clever tricks up my sleeve. For lack of any better options, I drew my knife out of its sheath and held it out of sight below the level of the table. The last thing I\u2019d want to do is stab someone, but I could at least menace them with it and buy us enough time to get out the door.\nTempi gave the three mercenaries an appraising look. Tam was inches", "taller than he, with shoulders like an ox. There was a bald fellow with a scarred face and a wicked grin. Last was the blonde woman who stood a full hand taller than Tempi.\n\u201cThere is only one woman,\u201d Tempi said, looking Tam in the eye. \u201cIs enough? You may bring one more.\u201d\nThe female mercenary bristled. \u201cYou swaggercock,\u201d she spat. \u201cI\u2019ll show you what a woman can do in a fight.\u201d\nTempi nodded politely.\nHis continuing lack of concern began to relax me. I had heard the stories, of course, a single Adem mercenary defeating a dozen regular soldiers. Could Tempi really fight off these three at the same time? He certainly seemed to think so. . . .\nTempi looked at them. \u201cThis is my first fight of this sort. How does begin?\u201d\nMy palm started to sweat where I gripped the knife.\nTam stepped up so their chests were only inches apart. He loomed over Tempi. \u201cWe\u2019ll start by whipping you bloody. Then we\u2019ll give you a kicking. Then we\u2019ll come round and do it agin to make sure we didn\u2019t miss anything.\u201d As he said the last, he slammed his forehead down into Tempi\u2019s face.\nMy breath caught in my chest, and before I could get it back, the fight was over.\nWhen the bearded mercenary snapped his head forward, I had expected to see Tempi reel backward, nose broken and gushing blood. But Tam was the one who staggered backward, howling and clutching at his face, blood spurting from beneath his hands.\nTempi stepped forward, got his hand on the back of the big man\u2019s neck, and spun him effortlessly into the ground where he landed in a messy tangle of arms and legs.\nWithout a hint of hesitation, Tempi turned and kicked the blonde woman squarely in the hip, making her stagger. While she was reeling, Tempi punched her sharply in the side of the head, and she folded bonelessly to the ground.\nThat\u2019s when the bald man stepped in, arms spread like a wrestler. Quick as a snake, he got one hand on Tempi\u2019s shoulder and the other on his neck.\nI honestly can\u2019t say what happened next. There was a flurry of movement, and Tempi was left gripping the man\u2019s wrist and shoulder. The bald man snarled and struggled. But Tempi simply twisted the man\u2019s arm until he was", "bent over, staring at the floor. Then Tempi kicked the man\u2019s leg out from under him, sending him tumbling to the ground.\nAll in less time than it takes to tell it. If I hadn\u2019t been so stunned, I would have burst into applause.\nTam and the woman lay with the dead stillness of those deeply unconscious. But the bald man snarled something and began to make his way unsteadily back to his feet. Tempi stepped close, struck him in the head with casual precision, then watched the man slump limply to the ground.\nIt was, I thought idly, the most polite punch I\u2019d ever seen. It was the careful blow of a skilled carpenter pounding a nail: hard enough to drive it fully home, but not so hard as to bruise the wood around it.\nThe room was very quiet in the aftermath. Then the tall man who had refused to fight raised his mug in salute, spilling a little. \u201cGood on you!\u201d he said loudly to Tempi, laughing. \u201cNobody will think less of you if you show Tam a bit of your boot while he\u2019s down there. Lord knows he\u2019s done it enough in his day.\u201d\nTempi looked down as if considering it, then shook his head and walked quietly back to our table. All eyes were still watching him, but the looks weren\u2019t nearly as dark as before.\nTempi came back to the table. \u201cDid you watch my back?\u201d\nI looked up at him blankly, then nodded.\n\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d\nOnly then did I understand what he really meant. \u201cYour back was very\nstraight.\u201d\nApproval. \u201cYour back is not straight.\u201d He held up a flat hand, tilted to one\nside. \u201cThat is why you stumble in the Ketan. It is . . .\u201d Looking down, he trailed off, having noticed my knife half-concealed in my tatty cloak. He frowned. Actually frowned with his face. It was the first time I\u2019d seen him do it, and it was amazingly intimidating.\n\u201cWe will speak on this later,\u201d he said. At his side, he gestured: Vast disapproval.\nFeeling more chastised than if I\u2019d spent an hour on the horns, I ducked my head and put the knife away.\n \nWe had been walking quietly for hours, our packs heavy with supplies, when Tempi finally spoke. \u201cThere is a thing I must teach you.\u201d Serious.\n\u201cI am always glad to learn,\u201d I said, making the gesture I hoped meant\nearnest.\nTempi walked to the side of the road, set down his heavy pack, and sat on the grass. \u201cWe must speak of the Lethani.\u201d\nIt took all my control to not burst out into a sudden, giddy smile. I had been wanting to bring up the subject for a long while, as we were much closer than when I\u2019d first asked him. But I hadn\u2019t wanted to risk offending him again.\nI sat quietly for a moment, partly to maintain my composure, but also to let Tempi know I was treating this subject with respect. \u201cThe Lethani,\u201d I repeated carefully. \u201cYou said I must not ask of it.\u201d\n\u201cYou must not then. Now perhaps. I . . .\u201d Uncertain. \u201cI am pulled many ways. But now asking is.\u201d\nI waited for another moment to see if he would continue on his own. When he didn\u2019t, I asked the obvious question. \u201cWhat is the Lethani?\u201d\nSerious. Tempi looked at me for a long moment, then suddenly burst out laughing. \u201cI do not know. And I cannot tell you.\u201d He laughed again. Understatement. \u201cStill we must speak of it.\u201d\nI hesitated, wondering if this was one of his strange jokes that I could never seem to understand.\n\u201cIs complicated,\u201d he said. \u201cHard in my own language. Yours?\u201d Frustration. \u201cTell me what you know of the Lethani.\u201d\nI tried to think of how I could describe what I\u2019d heard of the Lethani using only the words he knew. \u201cI heard the Lethani is a secret thing that makes the Adem strong.\u201d\nTempi nodded. \u201cYes. This is true.\u201d\n\u201cThey say if you know the Lethani, you cannot lose a fight.\u201d\nAnother nod.\nI shook my head, knowing I wasn\u2019t getting my point across. \u201cThey say the\nLethani is a secret power. Adem keep their words inside.\u201d I made a gesture as if gathering things close to my body and hoarding them. \u201cThen those words are like wood in a fire. This word fire makes the Adem very strong. Very fast. Skin like iron. This is why you can fight many men and win.\u201d\nTempi looked at me intently. He made a gesture I didn\u2019t recognize. \u201cThat is mad talking,\u201d he said at last. \u201cIs that the correct word? Mad?\u201d He stuck out", "his tongue and rolled his eyes, wiggling his fingers at the side of his head.\nI couldn\u2019t help but laugh nervously at the display. \u201cYes. Mad is the word.\nAlso crazy.\u201d\n\u201cThen what you have said is mad talking and also crazy.\u201d\n\u201cBut what I saw today,\u201d I said. \u201cYour nose did not break when struck with\na man\u2019s head. That is no natural thing.\u201d\nTempi shook his head as he climbed to his feet. \u201cCome. Stand.\u201d\nI stood, and Tempi stepped close to me. \u201cStriking with the head is clever. It\nis quick. Can startle if opponent is not ready. But I am not not ready.\u201d\nHe stepped closer still, until we were almost touching chests. \u201cYou are the\nloud man,\u201d he said. \u201cYour head is hard. My nose is soft.\u201d He reached out and took hold of my head with both his hands. \u201cYou want this.\u201d He brought my head down, slowly, until my forehead pressed his nose.\nTempi let go of my head. \u201cStriking with the head is quick. For me, little time. Can I move?\u201d He moved my head down as he pulled away, and this time my forehead came into contact with his mouth instead, as if he were giving me a kiss. \u201cThis is not good. The mouth is soft.\u201d\nHe tipped my head back again. \u201cIf I am very fast . . .\u201d He took a full step back and brought my head down farther, until my forehead touched his chest. He let me go and I stood back up. \u201cThis is still not good. My chest is not soft. But this man has a head harder than many.\u201d His eyes twinkled a little, and I chuckled, realizing he had made a joke.\n\u201cSo.\u201d Tempi said, stepping back to where we were before. \u201cWhat can Tempi do?\u201d He motioned. \u201cStrike with the head. Slow. I show.\u201d\nVaguely nervous, I brought my head down slowly, as if trying to break his nose.\nMatching my slow speed, Tempi leaned forward and tucked his chin a bit. It wasn\u2019t much of a change, but this time as I brought my head down, my nose met the top of his head.\nTempi stepped back. \u201cSee? Cleverness. Not mad-thinking word fire.\u201d \u201cIt was very fast,\u201d I said, feeling slightly embarrassed. \u201cI could not see.\u201d \u201cYes. Fighting is fast. Train to be fast. Train, not word fire.\u201d\nHe gestured earnest and met my eye, a rarity for him. \u201cI tell this because\nyou are the leader. You need the knowing. If you think I have secret ways and iron skin . . .\u201d He looked away, shaking his head. Dangerous.\nWe both sat back down next to our packs.\n\u201cI heard it in a story,\u201d I said by way of explanation. \u201cA story like we tell", "around the fire at night.\u201d\n\u201cBut you,\u201d he pointed to me. \u201cYou have fire in your hands. You have . . .\u201d\nHe snapped his fingers, then made a gesture like a fire roaring up suddenly. \u201cYou have the doing of this, and you think the Adem have word fires inside?\u201d\nI shrugged. \u201cThat is why I ask of the Lethani. It seems mad, but I have seen mad things be true, and I am curious.\u201d I hesitated before asking my other question. \u201cYou said who knows the Lethani cannot lose a fight.\u201d\n\u201cYes. But not with word fires. The Lethani is a type of knowing.\u201d Tempi paused, obviously considering his words carefully. \u201cLethani is most important thing. All Adem learn. Mercenary learn twice. Shehyn learn three times. Most important. But complicated. Lethani is . . . many things. But nothing touched or pointed to. Adem spend whole lives thinking on the Lethani. Very hard.\n\u201cProblem,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not my place to teach my leader. But you are my student in language. Women teach the Lethani. I am not such. It is part of civilization and you are a barbarian.\u201d Gentle sorrow. \u201cBut you want to be civilization. And you have need of the Lethani.\u201d\n\u201cExplain it,\u201d I said. \u201cI will try to understand.\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cThe Lethani is doing right things.\u201d\nI waited patiently for him to continue. After a minute, he gestured,\nfrustration . \u201cNow you ask questions.\u201d He took a deep breath and repeated. \u201cThe Lethani is doing right things.\u201d\nI tried to think of an archetypical example of something good. \u201cSo the Lethani is giving a hungry child food to eat.\u201d\nHe made the wavering motion that meant, yes and no. \u201cThe Lethani is not doing a thing. Lethani is the thing that shows us.\u201d\n\u201cLethani means rules? Laws?\u201d\nTempi shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d He gestured to the forest around us. \u201cLaw is from outside, controlling. It is the . . . the horse mouth metal. And the head strings.\u201d Questioning.\n\u201cBridle and bit?\u201d I suggested. Motioning as if pulling a horse\u2019s head about with a pair of reins.\n\u201cYes. Law is bridle and bit. It controls from outside. The Lethani . . .\u201d He pointed between his eyes, then at his chest. \u201c. . . lives inside. Lethani helps decide. Law is made because many have no understanding of Lethani.\u201d\n\u201cSo with the Lethani a person does not need to follow the law.\u201d", "Pause. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d Frustration. He drew out his sword and held it parallel to the ground, its edge pointing up. \u201cIf you were small, walking this sword would be like the Lethani.\u201d\n\u201cPainful for feet?\u201d I asked, trying to lighten the mood a bit. Amusement.\nAnger. Disapproval. \u201cNo. Difficult to walk. Easy to fall on one side. Difficult to stay.\u201d\n\u201cThe Lethani is very straight?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Pause. \u201cWhat is it called when there is many mountain and one place for walking?\u201d\n\u201cA path? A pass?\u201d\n\u201cPass.\u201d Tempi nodded. \u201cThe Lethani is like a pass in the mountains. Bends. Complicated. Pass is easy way through. Only way through. But not easy to see. Path that is easy much times not go through mountains. Sometimes goes nowhere. Starve. Fall onto hole.\u201d\n\u201cSo the Lethani is the right way through the mountains.\u201d\nPartial agreement. Excitement. \u201cIt is the right way through the mountains. But the Lethani is also knowing the right way. Both. And mountains are not just mountains. Mountains are everything.\u201d\n\u201cSo the Lethani is civilization.\u201d\nPause. Yes and no. Tempi shook his head. Frustrated.\nI thought back to what he had said about mercenaries having to learn the\nLethani twice. \u201cIs the Lethani fighting?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo.\u201d\nHe said this with such absolute certainty that I had to ask the opposite to make sure. \u201cIs the Lethani not fighting?\u201d\n\u201cNo. One who knows the Lethani knows when to fight and not fight.\u201d Very important.\nI decided to change directions. \u201cWas it of the Lethani for you to fight today?\u201d\n\u201cYes. To show Adem is not afraid. We know with barbarians, not fighting is coward. Coward is weak. Not good for them to think. So with many watching, fight. Also, to show one Adem is worth many.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if they had won?\u201d\n\u201cThen barbarians know Tempi is not worth many.\u201d Slight amusement.\n\u201cIf they had won, would today\u2019s fight be not of the Lethani?\u201d\n\u201cNo. If you fall and break a leg in mountain pass, it is still the pass. If I fail\nwhile following the Lethani, it is still the Lethani.\u201d Serious. \u201cThis is why we", "are talking now. Today. With your knife. That was not the Lethani. It was not a right thing.\u201d\n\u201cI was afraid you would be hurt.\u201d\n\u201cThe Lethani does not put down roots in fear,\u201d he said, sounding as if he were reciting.\n\u201cWould it be the Lethani to let you be hurt?\u201d\nA shrug. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d\n\u201cWould it be of the Lethani to let you be . . .\u201d Extreme emphasis. \u201cHurt?\u201d \u201cPerhaps no. But they did not. To be first with the knife is not of the\nLethani. If you win and are first with the knife, you do not win.\u201d Vast disapproval.\nI couldn\u2019t puzzle out what he meant by the last. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThe Lethani is right action. Right way. Right time.\u201d Tempi\u2019s face suddenly lit up. \u201cThe old trader man,\u201d he said with visible enthusiasm. \u201cIn the stories with the packs. What is the word?\u201d\n\u201cTinker?\u201d\n\u201cYes. The tinker. How you must treat such men?\u201d\nI knew, but I wanted to see what the Adem thought. \u201cHow?\u201d\nHe looked at me, his fingers pressing together irritation. \u201cYou must be\nkind, and help them. And speak well. Always polite. Always.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cAnd if they offer something, you must consider buying it.\u201d Tempi made a triumphant gesture. \u201cYes! You can do many things when\nmeeting tinker. But there is only one right thing.\u201d He calmed himself a little. Caution. \u201cBut only doing is not the Lethani. First knowing, then doing. That is the Lethani.\u201d\nI thought on this for a moment. \u201cSo being polite is the Lethani?\u201d\n\u201cNot polite. Not kind. Not good. Not duty. The Lethani is none of these. Each moment. Each choice. All different.\u201d He gave me a penetrating look. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nHappiness. Approval. Tempi got to his feet, nodding. \u201cIt is good you know you do not. Good that you say. That is also of the Lethani.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER EIGHTY-EIGHT": ["CHAPTER EIGHTY-EIGHT\nListening\nTEMPI AND I RETURNED to find the camp surprisingly cheerful. Dedan and Hespe were smiling at each other and Marten had managed to shoot a wild turkey for dinner.\nSo we ate and joked. And after the washing up was done, Hespe told her story about the boy who loved the moon, starting again at the beginning. Dedan kept his mouth miraculously shut, and I dared to hope our little group was finally, finally starting to become a team.\nJax had no trouble following the moon because in those days the moon was always full. She hung in the sky, round as a cup, bright as a candle, all unchanging.\nJax walked for days and days until his feet grew sore. He walked for months and months and his back grew tired beneath his packs. He walked for years and years and grew up tall and lean and hard and hungry.\nWhen he needed food, he traded out of the tinker\u2019s packs. When his shoes wore thin he did the same. Jax made his own way, and he grew up clever and sly.\nThrough it all, Jax thought about the moon. When he began to think he couldn\u2019t go another step, he\u2019d put on his spectacles and look up at her, round- bellied in the sky. And when he saw her he would feel a slow stirring in his chest. And in time he came to think he was in love.\nEventually the road Jax followed passed through Tinu\u00eb, as all roads do. Still he walked, following the great stone road east toward the mountains.\nThe road climbed and climbed. He ate the last of his bread and the last of his cheese. He drank the last of his water and the last of his wine. He walked for days without either, the moon growing larger in the night sky above him.\n \nJust as his strength was failing, Jax climbed over a rise and found an old man sitting in the mouth of a cave. He had a long grey beard and a long grey robe. He had no hair on the top of his head, or shoes on the bottom of his feet. His eyes were open and his mouth was closed.\nHis face lit up when he saw Jax. He came to his feet and smiled. \u201cHello, hello,\u201d he said, his voice bright and rich. \u201cYou\u2019re a long way from anywhere. How is the road to Tinu\u00eb?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s long,\u201d Jax said. \u201cAnd hard and weary.\u201d\nThe old man invited Jax to sit. He brought him water and goat\u2019s milk and fruit to eat. Jax ate hungrily, then offered the man a pair of shoes from his pack in trade.\n\u201cNo need, no need,\u201d the old man said happily, wiggling his toes. \u201cBut thanks for offering all the same.\u201d\nJax shrugged. \u201cAs you will. But what are you doing here, so far from everything?\u201d\n\u201cI found this cave when I was out chasing the wind,\u201d the old man said. \u201cI decided to stay because this place is perfect for what I do.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d Jax asked.\n\u201cI am a listener,\u201d the old man said. \u201cI listen to things to see what they have to say.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d Jax said carefully. \u201cAnd this is a good place for that?\u201d\n\u201cQuite good. Quite excellent good,\u201d the old man said. \u201cYou need to get a long ways away from people before you can learn to listen properly.\u201d He smiled. \u201cWhat brings you out to my little corner of the sky?\u201d\n\u201cI am trying to find the moon.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s easy enough,\u201d the old man said, gesturing to the sky. \u201cWe see her most every night, weather permitting.\u201d\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m trying to catch her. If I could be with her, I think I could be happy.\u201d\nThe old man looked at him seriously. \u201cYou want to catch her, do you? How long have you been chasing?\u201d\n\u201cMore years and miles than I can count.\u201d\nThe old man closed his eyes for a moment, then nodded to himself. \u201cI can hear it in your voice. This is no passing fancy.\u201d He leaned close and pressed his ear to Jax\u2019s chest. He closed his eyes for another long moment and was very still. \u201cOh,\u201d he said softly. \u201cHow sad. Your heart is broken and you\u2019ve never even had a chance to use it.\u201d", "Jax moved around, a little uncomfortable. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my asking,\u201d Jax said, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind you asking,\u201d the old man said. \u201cSo long as you don\u2019t mind me not telling. If you had my name, I\u2019d be under your power, wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u201cWould you?\u201d Jax asked.\n\u201cOf course.\u201d The old man frowned. \u201cThat is the way of things. Though you don\u2019t seem to be much for listening, it\u2019s best to be careful. If you managed to catch hold of even just a piece of my name, you\u2019d have all manner of power over me.\u201d\nJax wondered if this man might be able to help him. While he didn\u2019t seem to be terribly ordinary, Jax knew he was on no ordinary errand. If he\u2019d been trying to catch a cow, he would ask a farmer\u2019s help. But to catch the moon, perhaps he needed the help of an odd old man. \u201cYou said you used to chase the wind,\u201d Jax said. \u201cDid you ever catch it?\u201d\n\u201cIn some ways yes,\u201d the old man said. \u201cAnd in other ways, no. There are many ways of looking at that question, you see.\u201d\n\u201cCould you help me catch the moon?\u201d\n\u201cI might be able to give you some advice,\u201d the old man said reluctantly. \u201cBut first you should think this over, boy. When you love something, you have to make sure it loves you back, or you\u2019ll bring about no end of trouble chasing it.\u201d\nHespe didn\u2019t look at Dedan as she said this. She looked everywhere in the world but at him. Because of this, she didn\u2019t see the stricken, helpless look on his face.\n\u201cHow can I find out if she loves me?\u201d Jax asked.\n\u201cYou could try listening,\u201d the old man said, almost shyly. \u201cIt works wonders, you know. I could teach you how.\u201d\n\u201cHow long would that take?\u201d\n\u201cA couple years,\u201d the old man said. \u201cGive or take. It depends on if you have a knack for it. It\u2019s tricky, proper listening. But once you have it, you\u2019ll know the moon down to the bottoms of her feet.\u201d\nJax shook his head. \u201cToo long. If I can catch her, I can talk with her. I can make\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s part of your problem right there,\u201d the old man said. \u201cYou don\u2019t really want to catch her. Not really. Will you trail her through the sky? Of course not. You want to meet her. That means you need the moon to come to you.\u201d", "\u201cHow can I do that?\u201d he said.\nThe old man smiled. \u201cWell that\u2019s the question, isn\u2019t it? What do you have that the moon might want? What do you have to offer the moon?\u201d\n\u201cOnly what I have in these packs.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not quite what I meant,\u201d the old man muttered. \u201cBut we might as well take a look at what you\u2019ve brought, too.\u201d\nThe old hermit looked through the first pack and found many practical things. The contents of the second pack were more expensive and rare, but no more useful.\nThen the old man saw the third pack. \u201cAnd what do you have in there?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been able to get it open,\u201d Jax said. \u201cThe knot is too much for me.\u201d\nThe hermit closed his eyes for a moment, listening. Then he opened his eyes and frowned at Jax. \u201cThe knot says you tore at it. Pricked it with a knife. Bit it with your teeth.\u201d\nJax was surprised. \u201cI did,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI told you, I tried everything to get it open.\u201d\n\u201cHardly everything,\u201d the hermit said scornfully. He lifted the pack until the knotted cord was in front of his face. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cBut would you open up?\u201d He paused. \u201cYes. I apologize. He won\u2019t do it again.\u201d\nThe knot unraveled and the hermit opened the pack. Looking inside, his eyes widened and he let out a low whistle.\nBut when the old man spread the pack open on the ground, Jax\u2019s shoulders slumped. He had been hoping for money, or gems, some treasure he could give the moon as a gift. But all the pack held was a bent piece of wood, a stone flute, and a small iron box.\nOf these, only the flute caught Jax\u2019s attention. It was made of a pale green stone. \u201cI had a flute when I was younger,\u201d Jax said. \u201cBut it broke and I could never make it right again.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re all quite impressive,\u201d the hermit said.\n\u201cThe flute is nice enough,\u201d Jax said with a shrug. \u201cBut what use is a piece of wood and a box too small for anything practical?\u201d\nThe hermit shook his head. \u201cCan\u2019t you hear them? Most things whisper. These things shout.\u201d He pointed at the piece of crooked wood. \u201cThat is a folding house unless I miss my guess. Quite a nice one too.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a folding house?\u201d\n\u201cYou know how you can fold a piece of paper on itself, and each time it", "gets smaller?\u201d the old man gestured at the piece of crooked wood. \u201cA folding house is like that. Except it\u2019s a house, of course.\u201d\nJax took hold of the piece of crooked wood and tried to straighten it. Suddenly he was holding two pieces of wood that resembled the beginning of a doorframe.\n\u201cDon\u2019t unfold it here!\u201d the old man shouted. \u201cI don\u2019t want a house outside my cave, blocking my sunlight!\u201d\nJax tried to push the two pieces of wood, back together. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I fold it back up?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you don\u2019t know how, I expect,\u201d the old man said plainly. \u201cI suggest you wait until you know where you want it before you unfold it the rest of the way.\u201d\nJax set the wood down carefully, then picked up the flute. \u201cIs this special too?\u201d He put it to his lips and blew a simple trill like a Will\u2019s Widow.\nHespe smiled teasingly, lifted a familiar wooden whistle to her lips, and blew: Ta-ta DEE. Ta-ta DEE.\nNow everyone knows the Will\u2019s Widow is also called a nightjar. So it isn\u2019t out when the sun is shining. Despite this, a dozen nightjars flew down and landed all around Jax, looking at him curiously and blinking in the bright sunlight.\n\u201cIt seems to be more than the usual flute,\u201d the old man said.\n\u201cAnd the box?\u201d Jax reached out and picked it up. It was dark, and cold, and small enough that he could close his hand around it.\nThe old man shivered and looked away from the box. \u201cIt\u2019s empty.\u201d \u201cHow can you tell without seeing inside?\u201d\n\u201cBy listening,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m amazed you can\u2019t hear it yourself. It\u2019s the\nemptiest thing I\u2019ve ever heard. It echoes. It\u2019s meant for keeping things inside.\u201d\n\u201cAll boxes are meant for keeping things inside.\u201d\n\u201cAnd all flutes are meant to play beguiling music,\u201d the old man pointed out. \u201cBut this flute is moreso. The same is true with this box.\u201d\nJax looked at the box for a moment, then set it down carefully and began to tie up the third pack with the three treasures inside it. \u201cI think I\u2019ll be moving on,\u201d Jax said.\n\u201cAre you sure you won\u2019t consider staying for a month or two?\u201d the old man said. \u201cYou could learn to listen just a bit more closely. Useful thing, listening.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019ve given me some things to think about,\u201d Jax said. \u201cAnd I think you\u2019re right, I shouldn\u2019t be chasing the moon. I should make the moon come to me.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I actually said,\u201d the old man murmured. But he did so in a resigned way. Skilled listener that he was, he knew he wasn\u2019t being heard.\nJax set off the next morning, following the moon higher into the mountains. Eventually he found a large, flat piece of ground nestled high among the tallest peaks.\nJax brought out the crooked piece of wood and, piece by piece, began to unfold the house. With the whole night in front of him, he was hoping to have it finished well before the moon began to rise.\nBut the house was much larger than he had guessed, more a mansion than a simple cottage. What\u2019s more, unfolding it was more complicated than he had expected. By the time the moon reached the top of the sky, he was still far from being finished.\nPerhaps Jax hurried because of this. Perhaps he was reckless. Or perhaps it was just that Jax was unlucky as ever.\nIn the end the result was the same: the mansion was magnificent, huge and sprawling. But it didn\u2019t fit together properly. There were stairways that led sideways instead of up. Some rooms had too few walls, or too many. Many rooms had no ceiling, and high above they showed a strange sky full of unfamiliar stars.\nEverything about the place was slightly skewed. In one room you could look out the window at the springtime flowers, while across the hall the windows were filmed with winter\u2019s frost. It could be time for breakfast in the ballroom, while twilight filled a nearby bedroom.\nBecause nothing in the house was true, none of the doors or windows fit tight. They could be closed, even locked, but never made fast. And as big as it was, the mansion had a great many doors and windows, so there were a great many ways both in and out.\nJax paid no mind to any of this. Instead, he raced to the top of the highest tower and put the flute to his lips.\nHe poured out a sweet song into the clear night sky. No simple bird trill, this was a song that came from his broken heart. It was strong and sad. It fluttered like a bird with a broken wing.\nHearing it, the moon came down to the tower. Pale and round and beautiful, she stood before Jax in all her glory, and for the first time in his life", "he felt a single breath of joy.\nThey spoke then, on the top of the tower. Jax telling her of his life, his\nwager, and his long, lonely journey. The moon listened, and laughed, and smiled.\nBut eventually she looked longingly toward the sky.\nJax knew what this foretold. \u201cStay with me,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cI can only be happy if you\u2019re mine.\u201d\n\u201cI must go,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sky is my home.\u201d\n\u201cI have made a home for you,\u201d Jax said, gesturing to the vast mansion below them. \u201cThere is sky enough for you here. An empty sky that is all for you.\u201d\n\u201cI must go,\u201d she said. \u201cI have been away too long.\u201d\nHe raised his hand as if to grab her, then stopped himself. \u201cTime is what we make it here,\u201d he said. \u201cYour bedroom can be winter or spring, all according to your desire.\u201d\n\u201cI must go,\u201d she said, looking upward. \u201cBut I will return. I am always and unchanging. And if you play your flute for me, I will visit you again.\u201d\n\u201cI have given you three things,\u201d he said. \u201cA song, a home, and my heart. If you must go, will you not give me three things in return?\u201d\nShe laughed, holding her hands out to her sides. She was naked as the moon. \u201cWhat do I have that I can leave with you? But if it is mine to give, ask and I will give it.\u201d\nJax found his mouth was dry. \u201cFirst I would ask for a touch of your hand.\u201d\n\u201cOne hand clasps another, and I grant you your request.\u201d She reached out to him, her hand smooth and strong. At first it seemed cool, then marvelously warm. Gooseflesh ran all up and down Jax\u2019s arms.\n\u201cSecond, I would beg a kiss,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOne mouth tastes another, and I grant you your request.\u201d She leaned in close to him. Her breath was sweet, her lips firm as fruit. The kiss pulled the breath out of Jax, and for the first time in his life, his mouth curved into the beginning of a smile.\n\u201cAnd what is the third thing?\u201d the moon asked. Her eyes were dark and wise, her smile was full and knowing.\n\u201cYour name,\u201d Jax breathed. \u201cThat I might call you by it.\u201d\n\u201cOne body . . .\u201d the moon began, stepping forward eagerly. Then she paused. \u201cOnly my name?\u201d she asked, sliding her hand around his waist.\nJax nodded.", "She leaned close and spoke warmly against his ear, \u201cLudis.\u201d\nAnd Jax brought out the black iron box, closing the lid and catching her name inside.\n\u201cNow I have your name,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cSo I have mastery over you. And I say you must stay with me forever, so I can be happy.\u201d\nAnd so it was. The box was no longer cold in his hand. It was warm, and inside he could feel her name, fluttering like a moth against a windowpane.\nPerhaps Jax had been too slow in closing the box. Perhaps he fumbled with the clasp. Or perhaps he was simply unlucky in all things. But in the end he only managed to catch a piece of the moon\u2019s name, not the thing entire.\nSo Jax could keep her for a while, but she always slips away from him. Out from his broken mansion, back to our world. But still, he has a piece of her name, and so she always must return.\nHespe looked around at us, smiling. \u201cAnd that is why the moon is always changing. And that is where Jax keeps her when she is not in our sky. He caught her and he keeps her still. But whether or not he is happy is only for him to know.\u201d\nThere was a long moment of silence.\n\u201cThat,\u201d Dedan said, \u201cis one hell of a story.\u201d\nHespe looked down, and though the firelight made it difficult to tell, I\nwould have bet a penny she was blushing. Hard Hespe, who I wouldn\u2019t have guessed had a drop of blushing in her. \u201cIt took me a long time to remember all of it,\u201d she said, \u201cMy mother used to tell it to me when I was a little girl. Every night, always the same. Said she learned it from her mother.\u201d\n\u201cWell you\u2019ll need to make sure you tell your daughters, too,\u201d Dedan said. \u201cA story like that is too good to let fall by the roadside.\u201d\nHespe smiled.\nUnfortunately, that peaceful evening was like the lull that comes in the center of a storm. The next day Hespe made a comment that sent Dedan off in a\n  \nhuff, and for two hours they could barely look at each other without hissing like angry cats.\nDedan tried to convince everyone we should give up our search and instead sign up as caravan guards, hoping the bandits would attack us. Marten said that made as much sense as trying to find a bear trap by putting your foot in it. Marten was right, but that didn\u2019t keep Dedan and the tracker from snapping at each other over the next couple days.\nTwo days later, Hespe gave a surprisingly girlish shriek of alarm while bathing. We ran to her assistance, expecting bandits, and instead found Tempi naked, knee-deep in the stream. Hespe stood half-dressed and dripping wet on the shore. Marten thought it was hilarious. Hespe did not. And the only thing that kept Dedan from flying into a rage and attacking Tempi was the fact that he couldn\u2019t figure out how to attack a naked man without looking in his direction or actually touching him.\nThe day after that, the weather grew foggy and damp, souring everyone\u2019s mood and slowing our search even further.\nThen it began to rain.", ""], "CHAPTER EIGHTY-NINE": ["CHAPTER EIGHTY-NINE\nLosing the Light\nTHE LAST FOUR DAYS had been endlessly overcast and raining. At first the trees had given us some shelter, but we soon discovered that the leaves overhead merely held the rain, and the slightest stir of wind sent down showers of heavy drops that had been gathering for hours. This meant that whether or not it was currently raining, we were constantly dripped upon and damp.\nStories after supper had stopped. Marten caught a cold, and as it worsened he grew sullen and sarcastic. And two days ago the bread had gotten wet. This might sound like a small thing, but if you\u2019ve ever tried to eat a piece of wet bread after a day of walking in the rain, you know what sort of mood it puts you in.\nDedan had grown truly unmanageable. He balked and complained at the simplest of tasks. The last time he had gone into town for supplies, he had bought a bottle of dreg instead of potatoes, butter, and bowstrings. Hespe left him behind at Crosson and he didn\u2019t get back to camp until nearly midnight, stinking drunk and singing loud enough to make the dead cover their ears.\nI didn\u2019t bother telling him off. Sharp as my trouper\u2019s tongue was, he was obviously immune to it. Instead I waited until he passed out, poured the remaining dreg on the fire, and left the bottle sitting in the coals for him to see. After that, he stopped his constant derogatory muttering about me and settled into chilly silence. While the quiet was nice, I knew it was a bad sign.\nGiven everyone\u2019s rising temper, I\u2019d decided each of us would search for trail sign on our own. This was partly because walking in someone\u2019s footsteps over wet turf was a sure way to tear up the ground and leave a trail. But the other reason is that I knew if I sent Dedan and Hespe out together, their eventual argument would alert any bandit within ten miles.\n \nI came back to camp dripping wet and miserable. It turns out the boots I\u2019d bought in Severen didn\u2019t have a lick of waterproofing, so they drank rainwater like sponges. In the evening I could dry them out using the heat of the fire and a little careful sympathy. But as soon as I took three steps they were soaked through again. So on top of everything my feet had been cold and damp for days.\nIt was our twenty-ninth day in the Eld, and when I came over the tiny ridge that hid our latest camp, I saw Dedan and Hespe sitting on opposite sides of the fire, ignoring each other. Hespe was oiling her sword. Dedan was idly jabbing the ground in front of him with a pointed stick.\nI wasn\u2019t in much mood for conversation myself. Hoping the silence held, I went wordlessly to the fire.\nExcept there was no fire.\n\u201cWhat happened to the fire?\u201d I asked stupidly. What had happened was rather obvious. It had been left to burn down to charred sticks and damp ashes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my turn to get wood,\u201d Hespe said pointedly.\nDedan poked at the dirt with his stick. I noticed the beginnings of a bruise high on his cheek.\nAll I wanted in the world was a little something hot to eat and ten minutes with dry feet. It wouldn\u2019t make me happy, but it would bring me closer to happy than I\u2019d been all day. \u201cI\u2019m surprised the two of you can piss without help,\u201d I spat.\nDedan glared up at me. \u201cJust what do you mean by that?\u201d\n\u201cWhen Alveron asked me to do this job for him, he implied I would have adults helping me, not a handful of schoolchildren.\u201d\nDedan\u2019s snapped. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what she\u2014\u201d\nI cut him off. \u201cI don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care what you\u2019re bickering about. I don\u2019t care what she threw at you. I care that the fire is out. Tehlu above, a trained dog would be more help!\u201d\nDedan\u2019s expression firmed into a familiar belligerence. \u201cMaybe if\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d I said. \u201cI would rather listen to a jackass braying than waste my time with whatever you\u2019re saying. When I come back to camp I expect fire and a meal. If this is beyond you, I\u2019ll arrange to have some five-year-old come out from Crosson and babysit the both of you.\u201d\nDedan stood. The wind gusted in the trees above us, sending down heavy", "drops to patter on the ground. \u201cYou\u2019re on your way to a meal you won\u2019t be able to stomach, boy.\u201d\nHis hands clenched into fists, and I reached into my pocket to grip the mommet I had made of him two days ago. I felt my stomach clench in fear and fury. \u201cDedan, if you take a single step toward me, I will lay such pain on you that you will scream for me to kill you.\u201d I stared him square in the eye. \u201cRight now I am irritated. Do not even think of making me angry.\u201d\nHe paused, and I could almost hear him thinking of every story he had ever heard about Taborlin the Great. Fire and lightning. There was a moment of long silence as the two of us stared at each other, unblinking.\nLuckily, at this point Tempi returned to camp, breaking the tension. Feeling a little foolish, I went to the embers of the fire to see if I could rekindle it. Dedan stomped into the trees, hopefully in search of wood. At this point I didn\u2019t care if it was rennel or not.\nTempi sat by the side of the dead fire. Perhaps if I hadn\u2019t been busy I might have noticed something odd in his movement. Then again, perhaps not. Even for a semieducated barbarian such as myself, the moods of the Adem are difficult to read.\nAs I coaxed the fire slowly back to life, I began to regret how I had handled things. That thought alone kept me from lashing out at Dedan when he returned with an armload of wet wood and dropped it at the edge of my newly rebuilt fire, scattering it.\nMarten came back shortly after I had rebuilt the fire a second time. He settled at the edge of it and spread his hands. His eyes were sunken and dark.\n\u201cFeeling any better?\u201d I asked him.\n\u201cLoads.\u201d His voice rasped wetly in his chest, sounding worse than it had this morning. I worried about the sound of his breathing, about pneumonia, about fever.\n\u201cI can mix you a tea that will make your throat a little easier,\u201d I suggested without much hope. He\u2019d rejected all my offers of help over the last several days.\nHe hesitated, then nodded. As I was heating the water he had a fit of violent coughing that lasted nearly a minute. If the rain didn\u2019t stop tonight we would have to head into town and wait for him to recover. I couldn\u2019t risk him catching pneumonia or giving away our position to bandit sentries with a coughing fit.\nI handed him his tea, and Tempi stirred in his seat by the edge of the fire.", "\u201cI killed two men today,\u201d he said.\nThere was a long moment of stunned silence. Rain pattered on the ground\naround us. The fire hissed and spat.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked incredulously.\n\u201cI was attack by two men behind trees,\u201d Tempi said calmly.\nI rubbed the back of my neck. \u201cDammit Tempi, why didn\u2019t you say\nsomething before?\u201d\nHe gave me a level look and his fingers made an unfamiliar circle. \u201cIt is\nnot easy to kill two men,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d Hespe asked.\nTempi turned his cool look on her next. Offended. I\u2019d misunderstood his\nprevious comment. It wasn\u2019t the fight itself he had found difficult. It was the fact that he had killed two men. \u201cI have needed this time to settle my thought. Also, I wait to when all are here.\u201d\nI tried to remember the gesture for apology, but had to settle for sorrow instead. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked calmly as I fingered the frayed ends of my patience.\nTempi paused to choose his words. \u201cI was trying to find trail when two men jump out from trees.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did they look like?\u201d Dedan asked, beating me to the question.\nAnother pause. \u201cOne your size, his arms longer than mine, stronger than me but slow. Slower than you.\u201d Dedan\u2019s expression darkened, as if he couldn\u2019t decide if he had been insulted. \u201cThe other was smaller and quicker. Both their swords were broad and thick. Edged on both sides. This long.\u201d He held his hands perhaps three feet apart.\nI thought the description revealed more about Tempi than the men he fought. \u201cWhere did it happen? How long ago?\u201d\nHe pointed in the direction we had been searching. \u201cLess than one mile. Less than one hour.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think they were waiting for you?\u201d\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t there when I came through,\u201d Marten said defensively. He gave a wet, tearing cough deep in his chest and spat something thick onto the ground. \u201cIf they were waiting, they couldn\u2019t have been waiting long.\u201d\nTempi gave an eloquent shrug.\n\u201cWhat sort of armor did they have?\u201d Dedan asked.\nTempi was quiet for a moment, then reached out to tap my boot. \u201cThis?\u201d \u201cLeather?\u201d I suggested.", "He nodded. \u201cLeather. Hard, and with some metal.\u201d\nDedan relaxed a bit. \u201cThat\u2019s something at least.\u201d He mused, then looked up sharply at Hespe, \u201cWhat? What was that look you just gave me?\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t looking at you,\u201d Hespe said frostily.\n\u201cYou were so. You rolled your eyes.\u201d He looked at Marten. \u201cYou saw her roll her eyes, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cShut. Up.\u201d I snarled at the two of them. Surprisingly, things grew quiet. I pressed the heels of my hands to my eyes and gave our situation a moment of uninterrupted thought. \u201cMarten, how much light do we have left?\u201d\nHe looked up at the slate-colored sky. \u201cAbout another hour and a half like this,\u201d he rasped. \u201cEnough to track in. Then maybe a quarter hour of bad light after that. The sun will go down quick behind these clouds.\u201d\n\u201cDo you feel up to a little more running around today?\u201d I asked.\nHis grin surprised me. \u201cIf we can find these bastards tonight, let\u2019s do it. They\u2019ve kept me tramping around this God-forsaken place long enough.\u201d\nI nodded, reached out, and took a pinch of damp ash from the pitifully small fire. I rubbed it between my fingers thoughtfully, then wiped it onto a small rag and tucked it into my cloak. It wouldn\u2019t be a good source of heat, but anything was better than nothing.\n\u201cAlright,\u201d I said. \u201cTempi will lead us to the bodies, then we\u2019ll see if we can trail them back to their camp.\u201d I stood up.\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d Dedan said, holding out his hands. \u201cWhat about us?\u201d\n\u201cYou and Hespe stay here and guard the camp.\u201d I bit my tongue to keep from adding, and try to keep the fire from going out.\n\u201cWhy? Let\u2019s all go. We can take care of them tonight!\u201d He got to his feet. \u201cAnd what if there\u2019s a dozen of them?\u201d I asked in my best scathing tones. He paused, but didn\u2019t back down. \u201cWe\u2019ll have the element of surprise.\u201d \u201cWe won\u2019t have the element of surprise if all five of us go tramping\naround,\u201d I said hotly.\n\u201cWhy are you going then?\u201d Dedan demanded. \u201cIt could just be Tempi and\nMarten.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going because I need to see what we\u2019re up against. I\u2019m the one that is\ngoing to be making the plan that will get us through this alive.\u201d\n\u201cWhy should greenwood like you be making the plan at all?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re losing the light,\u201d Marten interjected wearily.\n\u201cBlessed Tehlu, a voice of reason speaks.\u201d I looked at Dedan. \u201cWe are\ngoing. You are staying. That is an order.\u201d", "\u201cAn order?\u201d Dedan echoed with dark incredulity.\nWe eyed each other dangerously for a moment, then I turned and followed Tempi into the trees. Thunder growled through the sky above us. A wind moved through the trees, clearing away the endless drizzle. In its place a steady rain began to fall.", ""], "CHAPTER NINETY": ["CHAPTER NINETY\nTo Sing a Song About\nTEMPI LIFTED THE PINE boughs that covered the two men. Laid carefully on their backs, they looked as if they were sleeping. I knelt at the side of the larger one, but before I could get a better look, I felt a hand on my shoulder. Looking back I saw Tempi shaking his head.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked. We had less than an hour of light left. Hunting down the bandits\u2019 camp without getting caught was going to be difficult enough. Doing it in a pitch-black storm would be a nightmare.\n\u201cYou should not,\u201d he said. Firm. Serious. \u201cTroubling the dead is not of the Lethani.\u201d\n\u201cI need to know about our enemies. I can learn things from them that will help us.\u201d\nHis mouth almost frowned, disapproval. \u201cMagic?\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cLooking only.\u201d I pointed to my eyes then tapped my temple. \u201cThinking.\u201d\nTempi nodded. But as I turned back to the bodies, I felt his hand on my shoulder again. \u201cYou must ask. They are my dead.\u201d\n\u201cYou already agreed,\u201d I pointed out.\n\u201cAsking is the right thing,\u201d he said.\nI took a deep breath. \u201cMay I look at your dead, Tempi?\u201d\nHe nodded once, formally.\nI looked over to where Marten was giving his bowstring a careful\ninspection under a nearby tree. \u201cDo you want to see if you can find their trail?\u201d He nodded and pushed himself away from the tree. \u201cI\u2019d start over there.\u201d I pointed to the south between two ridges.\n\u201cI know my business,\u201d he said as he walked off, shouldering his bow.\nTempi took a couple steps away, and I turned my attention to the bodies. One was actually quite a bit larger than Dedan, a great bull of a man. They were older than I had expected, and their hands had the calluses that mark long years of working with weapons. These were not disgruntled farm boys.", "These were veterans.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got their trail,\u201d Marten said, startling me. I hadn\u2019t heard the sound of\nhim approaching over the low susurrus of the falling rain. \u201cIt\u2019s clear as day. A drunk priest could follow it.\u201d There was a flicker of lightning across the sky and an accompanying grumble of thunder. The rain started to come down harder. I frowned and pulled the tinker\u2019s sodden cloak tighter around my shoulders.\nMarten tilted his head up and let the rain fall full on his face. \u201cI\u2019m glad this weather is finally doing us some good,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more it rains the easier it will be for us to sneak in and away from their camp.\u201d He wiped his hands on his dripping shirt and shrugged. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s not like we can get any wetter than we already are.\u201d\n\u201cYou have a point,\u201d I said, standing.\nTempi covered the bodies with the branches, and Marten led us away to the south.\nMarten knelt to examine something on the ground, and I took the opportunity to catch up with him.\n\u201cWe\u2019re being followed,\u201d I said, not bothering to whisper it. They were at least seventy feet behind us, and the rain was rolling through the trees with a noise like waves against the shore.\nHe nodded and pretended to point at something on the ground. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d seen them.\u201d\nI smiled and stripped water from my face with a wet hand. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one here with eyes. How many do you think there are?\u201d\n\u201cTwo, maybe three.\u201d\nTempi drew close to us. \u201cTwo,\u201d he said with certainty in his voice.\n\u201cI only saw one,\u201d I admitted. \u201cHow close are we to their camp?\u201d\n\u201cNo guess. Could be over the next hill. Could be miles off. There are still\njust these two sets of tracks, and I can\u2019t smell any fires.\u201d He stood up and started to follow the trail again without looking back.\nI pushed a low branch aside as Tempi walked past and caught a glimpse of movement behind us that had nothing to do with wind or rain. \u201cLet\u2019s go over this next ridge and set a little trap.\u201d\n \n\u201cSounds like the very thing,\u201d Marten agreed.\nGesturing for us to wait, Marten crouched low and edged his way up to the top of the small rise. I fought the urge to look behind us while he peered over the lip of the ridge, then scampered over.\nThere was a bright flash as lightning struck nearby. The thunder was like a fist in my chest. I startled. Tempi stood.\n\u201cThis is like of home,\u201d he said smiling faintly. He made no attempt to keep the water from his face.\nMarten waved, and we stalked over the top of the ridge. Once we were out of sight of whoever was following us, I looked around quickly. \u201cKeep following the tracks up to that twisted spruce, then circle back.\u201d I gestured. \u201cTempi hides there. Marten behind that fallen tree. I\u2019ll go behind that stone. Marten will make the first move. Use your judgment, but it would probably be best if you waited until they were past that broken stump. Try to leave one of them alive if possible, but we can\u2019t have them getting away or making too much noise.\u201d\n\u201cWhat will you be doing?\u201d Marten asked as we hurried to lay down a clear set of tracks as far as the twisted spruce tree.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be staying out of the way. The two of you are better equipped for this sort of thing. But I have a trick or two if it comes to that.\u201d We reached the tree. \u201cReady?\u201d\nMarten seemed a little startled by my sudden barrage of orders, but they both nodded and went quickly to their places.\nI circled around and settled behind a lumpish upcrop of stone. From my vantage I could see our muddy footprints mingling with the trail we followed. Past that I saw Tempi position himself behind the trunk of a thick burl oak. To his right, Marten nocked an arrow, drew the string back to his shoulder, and waited, motionless as a statue.\nI brought out the rag that held the pinch of ash and a slender piece of iron, holding them ready in my hand. My stomach churned as I thought about what we had been sent here to do: hunt and kill men. True, they were outlaws and murderers, but men nonetheless. I deepened my breathing and tried to relax.\nThe surface of the stone was chill and gritty against my cheek. I strained my ears but couldn\u2019t hear anything over the steady drumming of the rain. I fought the urge to lean farther around the edge of the stone and broaden my field of vision. Lightning flashed again, and I was counting the seconds until the thunder when I saw a pair of figures slink into view.", "I felt a sullen heat flare up in my chest. \u201cShoot them, Marten,\u201d I said loudly.\nDedan whirled around and was facing me with his sword drawn by the time I stepped from my hiding place. Hespe was a little more restrained and stopped with her sword halfway out of its scabbard.\nI put my knife away and walked to within a half-dozen steps of Dedan. The thunder rolled over us as I caught and held his eyes. His expression was defiant, and I did not bother to disguise my anger. After a long minute of silence he looked away, pretending he needed to brush the water from his eyes.\n\u201cPut that away.\u201d I nodded to his sword. After a second\u2019s hesitation he did so. Only then did I slide the thin piece of brittle steel I held back into the lining of my cloak. \u201cIf we were bandits you would already be dead.\u201d I moved my gaze from Dedan to Hespe and back again. \u201cGo back to camp.\u201d\nDedan\u2019s expression twisted. \u201cI\u2019m sick of you talking to me like I\u2019m a kid.\u201d He jabbed a finger toward me. \u201cI\u2019ve been in this world a lot longer than you. I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d\nI bit down several angry responses that couldn\u2019t help but make matters worse. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to argue with you. We\u2019re losing the light, and you\u2019re putting us in danger. Go back to camp.\u201d\n\u201cWe should take care of this tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve already knackered off two of them, there\u2019s probably only five or six left. We\u2019ll surprise them in the dark, in the middle of the storm. Wham. Bam. We\u2019ll be back in Crosson tomorrow for lunch.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what if there\u2019s a dozen of them? What if there\u2019s twenty? What if they\u2019re holed up in a farmhouse? What if they find our camp while no one\u2019s there? All our supplies, our food, and my lute could be gone, and a trap waiting for us when we come back. All because you couldn\u2019t sit still for an hour.\u201d His face reddened dangerously, and I turned away. \u201cGo back to camp. We\u2019ll talk about this tonight.\u201d\n\u201cNo, dammit. I\u2019m coming, and there\u2019s not a damn thing you can do to stop me.\u201d\nI ground my teeth. The worst part was that it was true. I had no way of enforcing my authority. There was nothing I could do short of subduing him with the wax simulacra I\u2019d made. And I knew that to be the worst possible option. Not only would it turn Dedan into an outright enemy, it would undoubtedly turn Hespe and Marten against me too.", "I looked to Hespe. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\nShe darted a quick look at Dedan. \u201cHe was going to go alone. I thought it was better if we stayed together. And we did think it through. Nobody\u2019s going to stumble onto the camp. We hid our gear and doused the fire before we left.\u201d\nI gave a tight sigh and tucked the useless pinch of ash into a pocket of my cloak. Of course they did.\n\u201cBut I agree,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should try to finish it tonight.\u201d\nI looked to Marten.\nHe gave me an apologetic look. \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t want this\nover,\u201d he said, then added quickly, \u201cIf we can do it smart.\u201d He might have said more, but the words caught in his throat and he began to cough.\nI looked at Tempi. Tempi looked back.\nThe worst thing was, my gut agreed with Dedan. I wanted this done. I wanted a warm bed and a decent meal. I wanted to get Marten somewhere dry. I wanted to go back to Severen where I could bask in Alveron\u2019s gratitude. I wanted to find Denna, apologize, and explain why I had left without a word.\nOnly a fool fights the tide. \u201cFine.\u201d I looked up at Dedan. \u201cIf one of your friends dies because of this, it will be your fault.\u201d I saw a flicker of uncertainty cross his face, then disappear as he set his jaw. He had said too much for his pride to let him back down.\nI leveled a long finger at him. \u201cBut from now on each of you must do as I say. I\u2019ll listen to your suggestions, but I give the orders.\u201d I looked around. Marten and Tempi nodded right away, with Hespe following only a second after. Dedan gave a slow nod.\nI looked at him. \u201cSwear it.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cIf you pull another stunt like this when we\u2019re attacking tonight, you could get us killed. I don\u2019t trust you. I\u2019d rather leave tonight than go into this with someone I can\u2019t trust.\u201d\nThere was another tense moment, but before it stretched too long Marten chimed in, \u201cC\u2019mon Den. The boy\u2019s actually got a fair bit on the ball. He set up this little ambush in about four seconds.\u201d His tone turned jocular. \u201cBesides, he\u2019s not as bad as that bastard Brenwe, and the money for that little privy-dance wasn\u2019t half as good.\u201d\nDedan cracked a smile. \u201cYeah, I suppose you\u2019re right. So long as it\u2019s over tonight.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t doubt for a second Dedan would still go his own way if it suited", "him. \u201cSwear you\u2019ll follow my orders.\u201d\nHe shrugged and looked away. \u201cYeah. I swear.\u201d\nNot enough. \u201cSwear it on your name.\u201d\nHe wiped the rain from his face and looked back at me, confused. \u201cWhat?\u201d I faced him and spoke formally. \u201cDedan. Will you do as I say tonight,\nwithout questioning or hesitation? Dedan. Do you swear it on your name?\u201d He shifted from foot to foot for a moment, then straightened a little. \u201cI\nswear it on my name.\u201d\nI stepped closer to him and said \u201cDedan\u201d very softly. At the same time I\nfed a small, tiny burst of heat through the wax simulacra in my pocket. Not enough to do anything, but enough that he could feel it, just for a moment.\nI saw his eyes widen, and I gave him my best Taborlin the Great smile. The smile was full of secrets, wide and confident, and more than slightly smug. It was a smile that told an entire story all by itself.\n\u201cI have your name now,\u201d I said softly. \u201cI have mastery over you.\u201d\nThe look on his face was almost worth a month of his grumbling. I stepped back and let the smile disappear, quick as a flicker of lightning. Easy as taking off a mask. Which, of course, would leave him wondering which expression was the real one, the young boy or the half-glimpsed Taborlin?\nI turned away before I lost the moment. \u201cMarten will scout ahead. Tempi and I will follow five minutes behind. That will give him time to spot their lookouts and come back to warn us. You two follow ten minutes behind us.\u201d\nI gave Dedan a pointed look and held up both hands with my fingers splayed. \u201cTen full minutes. It\u2019ll be slower this way. But it\u2019s safest. Any suggestions?\u201d Nobody said anything. \u201cAll right. Marten, it\u2019s your show. Come back if you run into trouble.\u201d\n\u201cCount on it,\u201d he said, and soon passed from our sight, lost in the blurry green and brown of leaf and bark and rock and rain.\nThe rain continued to pelt down, and the light was beginning to fail as Tempi and I followed the trail, slinking from one hiding place to another. Noise, at least, was not a concern as the thunder made a near constant grumbling overhead.\nMarten appeared with no warning from the underbrush and motioned us to\n \nthe marginal shelter of a leaning maple. \u201cTheir camp is right up ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s tracks all over the place, and I saw light from their fire.\u201d\n\u201cHow many of them?\u201d\nMarten shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t get that close. As soon as I saw different sets of footprints I came back. I didn\u2019t want you following the wrong tracks and getting lost.\u201d\n\u201cHow far?\u201d\n\u201cAbout a minute\u2019s creep. You could see their fire from here, but their camp\u2019s on the other side of a rise.\u201d\nI looked at the faces of my two companions in the dimming light. Neither of them seemed nervous. They were suited for this sort of work, trained for it. Marten had his abilities as a tracker and a bowman. Tempi had the legendary skill of the Adem.\nI might have felt calm too, if I had had the opportunity to prepare some plan, some trick of sympathy that could tip things in our favor. But Dedan had ruined all hopes of that by insisting we attack tonight. I had nothing, not even a bad link to a distant fire.\nI stopped that line of thinking before it could turn from anxiety to panic. \u201cLet\u2019s go then,\u201d I said, pleased at the calm timbre of my voice.\nThe three of us crept forward as the last of the light slowly bled from the sky. In the grey, Marten and Tempi were difficult to see, which reassured me. If it was hard for me, it would be near impossible for sentries to spot us from a distance.\nSoon I spied firelight reflecting off the undersides of high branches ahead. Crouching, I followed Marten and Tempi up the side of a steep bank, made slippery by the rain. I thought I saw a stir of movement ahead of us.\nThen lightning struck. In the near dark it was enough to blind me, but not before the muddy bank was highlighted in dazzling white.\nA tall man stood on the ridge with a drawn bow. Tempi crouched a few feet up the bank, frozen in the act of carefully placing his feet. Above him was Marten. The old tracker had gone to one knee and drawn his bow as well. The lightning showed me all of this in a great flash, then left me blind. The thunder came an instant after, deafening me as well. I dropped to the ground and rolled, wet leaves and dirt clinging to my face.\nWhen I opened my eyes all I could see were the blue ghosts the lightning had left dancing in front of my eyes. There was no outcry. If the sentry had made one it had been covered by the thunder. I lay very still until my eyes", "adjusted. It took me a long, breathless second to find Tempi. He was up the bank some fifteen feet, kneeling over a dark shape. The sentry.\nI approached him, scrabbling through the wet fern and muddy leaves. Lightning flickered again above us, more gently this time, and I saw the shaft of one of Marten\u2019s arrows protruding at an angle from the sentry\u2019s chest. The fletching had come loose and it fluttered in the wind like a tiny, sodden flag.\n\u201cDead,\u201d Tempi said when Marten and I were close enough to hear.\nI doubted it. Even a deep chest wound won\u2019t kill a man as quickly as that. But as I moved closer I saw the angle of the arrow. It was a heart shot. I looked at Marten with amazement. \u201cThat\u2019s a shot to sing a song about,\u201d I said quietly.\n\u201cLuck.\u201d He dismissed it and turned his attention to the top of the ridge a few feet above us. \u201cLet\u2019s hope I have some left,\u201d he said as he began to crawl.\nAs I crawled after him I caught a glimpse of Tempi still kneeling over the fallen man. He leaned close, as if whispering to the body.\nThen I saw the camp, and all vague curiosity about the Adem\u2019s peculiarity was pushed from my mind.", ""], "CHAPTER NINETY-ONE": ["CHAPTER NINETY-ONE\nFlame, Thunder, Broken Tree\nTHE RIDGE WE CROUCHED on made a wide half-circle, holding the bandits\u2019 camp in the center of a protective crescent. The result was that the camp sat at the bottom of a large, shallow bowl. From our position I could see the open portion of the bowl was bordered by a stream that curved in and away.\nThe trunk of a towering oak tree rose like a pillar in the center of the bowl, sheltering the camp with its huge branches. Two fires burned sullenly on either side of the great oak. Both would have been big as bonfires if not for the weather. As it was, they merely shed enough light to reveal the camp.\nCamp is a misleading term, \u201cencampment\u201d would be better. There were six field tents, short and sloping, mostly intended for sleeping and storing equipment. The seventh tent was almost a small pavilion, rectangular and large enough for several men to stand upright.\nSix men sat huddled close to the fires on makeshift benches. They were bundled up against the rain, all of them with the hard-eyed, long-suffering look of experienced soldiers.\nI ducked back below the ridgeline and was surprised to feel no fear at all. I turned to Marten, and saw his eyes were a little wild. \u201cHow many do you think there are?\u201d I asked.\nHis eyes flickered thoughtfully. \u201cAt least two to a tent. If their leader keeps to the big tent that makes thirteen, and we\u2019ve killed three. So ten. Ten at the very least.\u201d He licked his lips nervously. \u201cBut they could be sleeping as many as four to a tent, and the big tent could sleep five more in addition to the leader. That makes thirty, less three.\u201d\n\u201cSo at best we\u2019re outnumbered two to one,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you like those odds?\u201d\nHis eyes moved to the ridgeline, then back to me. \u201cI\u2019d take two to one. We\u2019ve got surprise, we\u2019re right up close.\u201d He paused and coughed into his sleeve. He spat. \u201cBut there\u2019s twenty of them down there. I can feel it in my", "balls.\u201d\n\u201cCan you convince Dedan?\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cHe\u2019ll believe me. He\u2019s not half the ass he seems most of the\ntime.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d I considered briefly. Things had been happening more quickly\nthan I can tell them aloud. So despite everything that had happened, Dedan and Hespe were still five or six minutes behind us. \u201cGo turn the two of them around,\u201d I told Marten. \u201cThen come back for Tempi and me.\u201d\nHe looked uncertain. \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to come now? We don\u2019t know when their guard might change.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll have Tempi with me. Besides, it should only take you a couple minutes. I want to see if I can get a better count of how many there are.\u201d\nMarten hurried off, and Tempi and I edged our way back up to the top of the ridge. After a moment he edged closer until the left side of his body was pressed up against my right.\nI noticed something I\u2019d missed earlier. There were wooden poles the size of tall fenceposts scattered throughout the camp.\n\u201cPosts?\u201d I asked Tempi, driving my finger into the ground to illustrate what I mean.\nHe nodded to show he understood, then shrugged.\nI guessed they might be tethers for horses, or drying poles for sodden clothes. I pushed it from my mind in favor of more pressing matters. \u201cWhat do you think we should do?\u201d\nTempi was silent for a long moment. \u201cKill some. Leave. Wait. Others come. We ...\u201d He gave the characteristic pause that meant he was lacking the word he wanted to use. \u201cJump behind trees?\u201d\n\u201cSurprise.\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cWe surprise. Wait. Hunt rest. Tell Maer.\u201d\nI nodded. Not the quick resolution we had hoped for, but the only sane\noption against this number of men. When Marten came back the three of us would take our first sting at them. I guessed with surprise on our side, Marten could mark as many as three or four with his bow before we were forced to flee. Odds were he wouldn\u2019t kill all of them, but any man arrowshot would be less of a threat to us in the days to come. \u201cAny other way?\u201d\nA long pause. \u201cNo way that is of the Lethani,\u201d he said.\nHaving seen enough, I carefully slid down several feet until I was out of sight. I shivered as the rain continued to pelt down. It felt colder than it had a", "couple minutes ago, and I began to worry that I\u2019d caught Marten\u2019s cold. That was the last thing I needed right now.\nI caught sight of Marten approaching and was about to explain our plan when I saw his panicked expression.\n\u201cI can\u2019t find them!\u201d he hissed frantically. \u201cI trailed back to where they should have been. But they weren\u2019t there. So either they already turned back, which they wouldn\u2019t do, or they were too close behind us and ended up following the wrong set of tracks in this bad light.\u201d\nI felt a chill that had nothing to do with the constant rain. \u201cCan\u2019t you track them down?\u201d\n\u201cIf I could, I would have. But all the prints look the same in the dark. What are we going to do?\u201d He clutched at my arm, I could tell by his eyes that he was on the verge of panic. \u201cThey won\u2019t be careful. They\u2019ll think we\u2019ve scouted everything ahead of them. What should we do?\u201d\nI reached into the pocket that held Dedan\u2019s simulacra. \u201cI can find them.\u201d\nBut before I could do anything, there was an outcry from the eastern edge of the camp. It was followed a second later by a furious shout and a string of cursing.\n\u201cIs that Dedan?\u201d I asked.\nMarten nodded. From over the ridge came the sound of frantic movement. The three of us moved as quickly as we dared, peering over the top.\nMen were swarming from the low tents like hornets from a nest. There were at least a dozen of them now, and I saw four with strung bows. Long sections of planking appeared from nowhere and were leaned against the posts, making crude walls about four feet high. Within seconds the vulnerable, wide-open camp became a veritable fortress. I counted at least sixteen men, but now whole sections of the camp were cut off from view. The light was worse as well, as the makeshift walls blocked the fires and cast deep shadows against the night.\nMarten was swearing a steady stream, understandably, as his bow wasn\u2019t nearly as useful now. He nocked an arrow quick as winking and might have fired it just as fast if I hadn\u2019t laid a hand on his arm. \u201cWait.\u201d\nHe frowned, then nodded, knowing they would have half a dozen arrows for every one of his. Tempi was suddenly useless as well. He would be riddled with arrows long before he came close to the camp.\nThe only bright facet was that their attention wasn\u2019t directed toward us. They were focused off to the east where we had heard the sentry\u2019s cry and", "Dedan\u2019s cursing. The three of us might escape before we were discovered, but that would mean leaving Dedan and Hespe behind.\nThis was the time when a skilled arcanist should be able to tip the scales, if not to give us an advantage, then at least to make escape possible. But I had no fire, no link. I was clever enough to make do without one of those, but without both I was nearly helpless.\nRain began to pour down more heavily. Thunder grumbled. It was only a matter of time before the bandits figured out there were only two of them and rushed over the ridge to make short work of our companions. If the three of us drew their attention we would be overrun just as quickly.\nThere was a concert of gentle hums, and a flight of arrows leapt over the eastern ridge. Marten stopped swearing and held his breath. He looked at me. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d he said urgently. There was a questioning shout from the camp, and when no answer was forthcoming another flight of arrows hummed over the eastern ridge, finding the range of their target.\n\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d Marten repeated. \u201cWhat if they\u2019re hurt?\u201d\nWhat if they\u2019re dead? I closed my eyes and slid down below the ridgeline, trying to gain a moment of clear thought. My foot bumped something soft and solid. The dead sentry. A dark thought occurred. I drew a deep breath and threw myself into the Heart of Stone. Deep. Deeper than I had ever been before. All fear left me, all hesitation.\nI took hold of the body by its wrist and began to drag it up toward the lip of the ridge. He was a heavy man, but I hardly noticed. \u201cMarten, may I use your dead?\u201d I asked absently. The words were in a pleasant baritone, the calmest voice I had ever heard.\nWithout waiting for an answer, I looked over the ridgeline toward the camp. I saw one of the men behind the wall bending his bow for another shot. I drew my long, slender knife of good Ramston steel and fixed the image of the bowman in my mind. I set my teeth and stabbed the dead sentry in the kidney. The knife went in slowly, as if I were stabbing heavy clay instead of flesh.\nA scream rose above the sound of the thunder. The man fell, his bow flying wildly out of his hands. Another mercenary stooped to look at his companion. I refocused and stabbed the sentry in his other kidney, using both hands this time. There was a second scream, shriller than the first. More a keen than a scream, I thought in an odd separate corner of my mind.\n\u201cDon\u2019t shoot yet,\u201d I cautioned Marten calmly, not looking away from the", "camp. \u201cThey still don\u2019t know where we are.\u201d I drew the knife out, refocused, and drove it coolly into the sentry\u2019s eye. A man stood upright behind the wooden wall, blood pouring down his face from underneath his clutching hands. Two of his comrades rose, trying to get him back below the wooden parapet. My knife rose and fell and one of them toppled to the ground even as his hands rose to his own bleeding face.\n\u201cHoly God,\u201d Marten choked. \u201cDear holy God.\u201d\nI set the knife against the sentry\u2019s throat and surveyed the camp. Their military efficiency was falling apart as they began to panic. One of the wounded men continued to scream, high and piercing over the grumbling thunder.\nI saw one of the bowmen searching the ridgeline with hard eyes. I drew the knife across the sentry\u2019s throat, but nothing seemed to happen. Then the bowman looked puzzled and raised his hand to touch his own throat. It came away lightly smeared with blood. His eyes grew wide and he began to shout. Dropping his bow he ran to the other side of the low wall, then back, trying to escape but not knowing where to run.\nThen he regained his composure and began desperately searching the ridgeline all around the camp. He showed no signs of falling. I frowned, set the knife against the dead sentry\u2019s neck again and leaned against it hard. My arms trembled, but the knife began to move again, slowly, as if I were trying to cut a block of ice. The bowman\u2019s hands flew to his neck and blood poured over them. He staggered, stumbled, and fell into one of the fires. He thrashed wildly, scattering burning coals everywhere, adding to the confusion.\nI was deciding where to strike next when lightning lit the sky, showing me a clear, stark picture of the body. The rain had mingled with the blood, and it was everywhere. My hands were dark with it.\nUnwilling to maim his hands, I rolled him over onto his stomach and struggled to remove his boots. Then I refocused myself and sawed through the thick tendons above the ankles and behind the knees. It crippled two more men. But the knife was moving more and more slowly, and my arms ached with the strain of it. The corpse was an excellent link, but the only energy I had was the strength of my body. Under these conditions, it felt more like I was cutting wood than flesh.\nIt had been scarcely more than a minute or two since the camp had been alerted. I spat water and took a moment\u2019s rest for my trembling arms and exhausted mind. I eyed the camp below, watching the confusion and panic", "build.\nA man emerged from the large tent at the base of the tree. He was dressed\ndifferently than the others, wearing a hauberk of bright chainmail that came nearly to his knees with a coif covering his head. He stepped into the chaos with a fearless grace, taking everything in at a glance. He snapped orders I couldn\u2019t hear over the sound of rain and thunder. His men calmed, settled back into their positions, and took up their bows and swords.\nAs I watched him stride across the encampment I was reminded of ... something. He stood in plain view, not bothering to crouch behind one of the protective walls. He gestured to his men, and something in that motion was terribly familiar....\n\u201cKvothe,\u201d Marten hissed. I looked up to see the tracker with his bow drawn tight to his ear. \u201cI\u2019ve got the shot on their boss.\u201d\n\u201cTake it.\u201d\nHis bow hummed and the man sprouted an arrow from his upper thigh, piercing the chain mail, the leg itself, and the armor behind it. From the corner of my eye I saw Marten draw another arrow and put it to the string in a fluid motion, but before he could shoot it, I saw their leader bend. Not a deep bending at the waist as if he were doubling over in pain. He bent at the neck to look down at the arrow that had pierced his leg.\nAfter a second\u2019s scrutiny he grasped the arrow in a fist and snapped off the fletching. Then he reached behind himself and pulled the arrow from his leg. I froze as he looked straight toward us and pointed to our position with the hand that held the broken arrow. He spoke a brief word of command to his men, tossed the arrow into the fire, and stalked gracefully to the other side of the camp.\n\u201cGreat Tehlu overroll me with your wings,\u201d Marten said, his hand falling away from his bowstring. \u201cProtect me from demons and creatures that walk in the night.\u201d\nOnly the fact that I was deep in the Heart of Stone kept me from a similar reaction. I turned back to the camp in time to see a small forest of bows being bent in our direction. I ducked my head and aimed a kick at the stupefied tracker, knocking him over as the arrows hummed past. He tumbled over, his quiver of arrows scattering down the muddy bank.\n\u201cTempi?\u201d I called.\n\u201cHere,\u201d he replied from off to my left. \u201cAesh. No arrow.\u201d\nMore arrows sang overhead, a few of them sticking into trees. Soon they", "would get the range and start arcing the arrows overhead so they fell on us from above. A thought came to me as calmly as a bubble rising to the surface of a pond. \u201cTempi, bring me this man\u2019s bow.\u201d\n\u201cIa.\u201d\nI heard Marten muttering something, his voice low, urgent, and indistinct. At first I thought he\u2019d been shot, then I realized he was praying. \u201cTehlu shelter me from iron and anger,\u201d he murmured softly. \u201cTehlu keep me safe from demons in the night.\u201d\nTempi pushed the bow into my hand. I took a deep breath and broke my mind into two pieces, then three, then four. In each piece of my mind I held the bowstring. I forced myself to relax and broke my mind again, five. I tried again and failed. Tired, wet and cold, I had reached my limit. I heard bowstrings thrum again and arrows hit the ground around us like a heavy rain. I felt a tug on the outside of my arm near my shoulder as one of the arrows grazed me before burying itself in the dirt. There was a stinging, then a burning pain.\nI pushed the pain away and set my teeth. Five would have to be enough. I drew my knife lightly across the back of my own arm, just enough to draw a little blood, then mouthed the proper bindings and drew the blade across the bowstring, hard.\nThe string held for a terrifying moment, then parted. The bow jerked in my hand, jolting my wounded arm before it flew out of my grasp. Cries of pain and dismay came over the ridge, letting me know I\u2019d been at least partly successful. Hopefully all five strings had been severed, leaving us with only one or two bowmen to deal with.\nBut as soon as the bow flung itself out of my grasp, I felt the cold leech into me. Not just my arms, but all the way through me: stomach, chest, and throat. I had known I couldn\u2019t trust the strength of my arm alone to make it through five bowstrings at once. So I had used the only fire that is always with an arcanist, the heat of my blood. Binder\u2019s chills would have me soon. If I didn\u2019t find a way to get warm, I would lapse into shock, then hypothermia, then death.\nI fell out of the Heart of Stone and let the pieces of my mind slide back together, reeling a bit in confusion. Chill, wet, and dizzy, I clawed my way back to the top of the ridgeline. The rain felt cold as sleet on my skin.\nI saw only one bowman. Unfortunately, he had kept his wits about him, and as soon as my face appeared over the top of the ridge, he drew and let fly", "in a smooth motion.\nA gust of wind saved me. His arrow struck harsh yellow sparks from a\nstone outcrop not two feet from my head. Rain pelted my face and lightning spidered across the sky. I pushed myself back down out of sight and stabbed the sentry\u2019s body over and over in a delirious rage.\nFinally, I struck a buckle and the blade snapped. Panting, I dropped the broken knife. I came back to my senses with the sound of Marten\u2019s forlorn praying in my ears. My limbs felt cold as lead, heavy and awkward.\nWorse than that, I could feel the numb sluggishness of hypothermia creeping through me. I realized I wasn\u2019t shivering, and knew it was a bad sign. I was soaking wet with no fire nearby to call my own.\nLightning etched the sky again. I had an idea. I laughed a terrible laugh.\nI looked over the top of the ridge and was pleased to see no bowmen. But the leader was barking new orders and I didn\u2019t doubt new bows would be found or strings replaced. Worse, they might simply abandon their shelter and overrun us with sheer numbers. There were easily a dozen men still standing.\nMarten still lay praying on the bank. \u201cTehlu who the fire could not kill, watch over me in fire.\u201d\nI kicked at him. \u201cGet up here damn you, or we\u2019re all dead.\u201d He paused in his praying and looked up. I shouted something incomprehensible and leaned over to drag him upward by the scruff of his shirt. I shook him hard and thrust his bow at him with my other hand, not knowing how it had come to be there.\nLightning flashed again and showed me what he saw. My hands and arms were covered with the sentry\u2019s blood. The pelting rain made it streak and run, but hadn\u2019t washed it away. It looked black in the brief, glaring light.\nMarten took his bow numbly. \u201cShoot the tree,\u201d I shouted over the thunder. He looked at me as if I had gone mad. \u201cShoot it!\u201d\nSomething in my expression must have convinced him, but his arrows were scattered, and he took up his litany again as he searched the muddy bank for one. \u201cTehlu who held Encanis to the wheel, watch over me in darkness.\u201d\nAfter a long moment of searching he found an arrow and fumbled to fit it to his string with trembling hands, praying all the while. I turned my attention back to the camp. Their leader had brought them back under control. I could see his mouth shouting orders, but all I could hear was the sound of Marten\u2019s trembling voice:", "Tehlu, whose eyes are true, Watch over me.\nSuddenly the leader paused and cocked his head. He held himself perfectly still as if listening to something. Marten continued praying:\nTehlu, son of yourself, Watch over me.\nTheir leader looked quickly to the left and right, as if he had heard something that disturbed him. He cocked his head again. \u201cHe can hear you!\u201d I shouted madly at Marten. \u201cShoot! He\u2019s getting them ready to do something!\u201d\nMarten took aim at the tree in the center of the camp. Wind buffeted him as he continued to pray.\nTehlu who was Menda who you were. Watch over me in Menda\u2019s name,\nIn Perial\u2019s name\nIn Ordal\u2019s name\nIn Andan\u2019s name Watch over me.\nTheir leader turned his head as if to search the sky for something. Something about the motion seemed terribly familiar, but my thoughts were growing muddy as binder\u2019s chills tightened their grip. The bandit leader turned and bounded for the tent, disappearing inside. \u201cShoot the tree!\u201d I screamed.\nHe let the arrow fly, and I saw it wedge firmly into the trunk of the massive oak that loomed in the center of the bandit\u2019s camp. I scrabbled in the mud for one of Marten\u2019s scattered arrows and began to laugh at what I was going to attempt. It might do nothing. It might kill me. The slippage alone ... But it didn\u2019t matter. I was dead already unless I found a way to get warm and dry. I would go into shock soon. Perhaps I was already there.\nMy hand closed on an arrow. I broke my mind six ways and shouted my bindings as I drove it deep into the sodden ground. \u201cAs above, so below!\u201d I shouted, making a joke only someone from the University could hope to understand.", "A second passed. The wind faded.\nThere was a whiteness. A brightness. A noise. I was falling. Then nothing.", ""], "CHAPTER NINETY-TWO": ["CHAPTER NINETY-TWO\nTaborlin the Great\nI WOKE. I WAS WARM and dry. It was dark.\nI heard a familiar voice questioning. Marten\u2019s voice, \u201cIt was all him. He\ndid it.\u201d\nQuestioning.\n\u201cI won\u2019t never say, Den. I swear to God I won\u2019t.

No. All I\u2019ll say is this. I think he called the lighting down. Like God himself.\u201d\nLike Taborlin the Great, I thought. And smiled. And slept.", ""], "CHAPTER NINETY-THREE": ["CHAPTER NINETY-THREE\nMercenaries All\nAFTER FOURTEEN HOURS OF sleep I was fit as a fiddle. My companions seemed surprised by this, as they\u2019d found me unconscious, cold to the touch, and covered in blood. They had stripped me, rubbed my limbs a bit, then rolled me in blankets and put me inside the bandits\u2019 single surviving tent. The other five had been either burned, buried, or lost when a great white pillar of lightning blasted the tall oak that stood at the center of the bandits\u2019 camp.\nThe next day was overcast but blessedly free of rain. First we tended to our hurts. Hespe had taken an arrow in the leg when the sentry had surprised them. Dedan had a deep gash along one of his shoulders, which was fairly lucky, considering he\u2019d rushed the sentry bare-handed. When I asked him about it, he said he simply hadn\u2019t had time to draw his sword.\nMarten had an angry red lump on his forehead above one eyebrow, either from when I had kicked him over or dragged him around. It was tender to the touch, but he claimed he had gotten worse a dozen times in tavern brawls.\nAfter I recovered from the chills I was fine. I could tell my companions were surprised by my sudden return from the doors of death and decided to leave them to their amazement. A little mystery wouldn\u2019t hurt my reputation.\nI bandaged the ragged cut where the arrow had grazed my shoulder and tended to a few bruises and scrapes I didn\u2019t remember receiving. I also had the long, shallow cut I had made on the top of my arm, but it was barely worth stitches.\nTempi was unhurt, unruffled, unreadable.\nOur second order of business was to tend to the dead. While I had been unconscious the rest of the group had pulled most of the burned, lifeless bodies to one side of the clearing. They tallied thus:\nOne sentry, killed by Dedan.\nTwo who had surprised Tempi in the forest.\nThree who had survived the lightning and tried to escape. Marten brought\none down, Tempi claimed the other two.", "Seventeen burned, broken, or otherwise ravaged by the lightning. Of those, eight had been dead, or wounded unto death, beforehand.\nWe found tracks of one sentry who had watched the whole incident from the northeast piece of the ridge. His tracks were a day old before we found them, and none of us felt the slightest desire to hunt him down. Dedan pointed out he might be worth more alive if he spread word of this spectacular defeat to others who were thinking of banditry as a way of life. For once we agreed on something.\nThe leader\u2019s body was not among those gathered. The large tent he had ducked into had been crushed beneath large sections of the huge oak\u2019s blasted trunk. Having more than enough to occupy us for the time being, we left his remains alone for now.\nRather than try to dig twenty-three graves, or even a mass grave large enough for twenty-three bodies, we built a pyre and kindled it while the surrounding forest was still wet with rain. I used my skills to ensure it burned hot and hard.\nBut there was one other: the sentry Marten had shot and I had put to use. While my companions were busy collecting wood for the pyre I went over the south side of the ridge and found where Tempi had hidden him away, covered with a fir branch.\nI looked at the body for a long time before I carried it away to the south. I found a quiet place under a willow and built a cairn of stones. Then I crept into the underbrush and was quietly, violently sick.\nThe lightning? Well, the lightning is difficult to explain. A storm overhead. A galvanic binding with two similar arrows. An attempt to ground the tree more strongly than any lightning rod. Honestly, I don\u2019t know if I can take credit for the lightning striking when and where it did. But as far as stories go, I called the lightning and it came.\nFrom the stories the others told, when the lightning struck it wasn\u2019t a single startling bolt, but several in quick succession. Dedan described it as \u201ca pillar of white fire,\u201d and said it shook the ground hard enough to knock him off his feet.\nRegardless of why, the towering oak was reduced to a charred stump about\n \nthe height of a greystone. Huge pieces of it lay scattered about. Smaller trees and shrubs had caught fire and been doused by the rain. Most of the long planks the bandits had used for their fortifications had exploded into pieces no bigger than the tip of your finger or burned to charcoal. Streaking out from the base of the tree were great tracks of churned-up earth, making the clearing look as if it had been plowed by a madman or raked by the claws of some huge beast.\nDespite this, we stayed at the bandit\u2019s camp for three days following our victory. The stream provided easy water, and what remained of the bandits\u2019 provisions were superior to our own. What\u2019s more, after we salvaged some lumber and canvas, each of us had the luxury of a tent or lean-to.\nWith our job completed, the tensions plaguing our group faded. The rain stopped, and we didn\u2019t need to be bashful about our fires anymore, and as a result Marten\u2019s cough was improving. Dedan and Hespe were civil to each other, and Dedan stopped about three-quarters of his incessant jackassery toward me.\nBut despite the relief at our job being done, things weren\u2019t entirely comfortable. There were no stories at night, and Marten distanced himself from me whenever he could. I could hardly blame him, considering what he had seen.\nWith that in mind, I took the first chance I had to privately destroy the wax mommets I had made. I had no use for them now, and I feared what might happen if one of my companions discovered them in my travelsack.\nTempi made no comment on what I\u2019d done with the bandit\u2019s body, and from what I could tell, he didn\u2019t seem to hold it against me. Looking back, I realize how little I truly understood the Adem. But at the time, all I noticed was that Tempi spent less time helping me practice the Ketan, and more time practicing our language and discussing the ever-confusing concept of the Lethani.\nWe fetched our equipment from our previous camp on the second day. I was relieved to have my lute back, and doubly glad to find Denna\u2019s marvelous case had stayed dry and tight despite the endless rain.\nAnd, since we were no longer slinking about, I played. For a solid day I did little else. It had been nearly a month since I had made any music, and I\u2019d missed it more than you can imagine.\nAt first I thought Tempi didn\u2019t care for my music. Aside from the fact that I\u2019d somehow insulted him by singing early on, he always left camp when I", "brought out my lute. Then I began to catch glimpses of him watching me, though always from a distance and usually at least partly hidden from sight. Once I knew to look for him, I discovered he was always listening while I played. Wide-eyed as an owl. Motionless as a stone.\nOn the third day, Hespe decided her leg could stand a little walking. So we had to decide what was going to come with us, and what would get left behind.\nIt wasn\u2019t going to be as difficult as it might have been. Most of the bandits\u2019 equipment had been destroyed by the lightning, the falling tree, or exposure to the storm. But there were still valuables to be salvaged from the ruined camp.\nWe had been prevented from making a good search of the leader\u2019s tent, as it had been crushed beneath one of the huge branches of the fallen oak. Over two feet thick, the fallen limb was larger than most trees in its own right. However, on the third day we finally managed to hatchet enough of it away so we could roll it off the wreckage of the tent.\nI was anxious to get a closer look at the leader\u2019s body, as something about him had been nagging my memory ever since I saw him step from the tent. And, in a more worldly vein, I knew his chain mail was worth at least a dozen talents.\nBut we didn\u2019t find any sign of the leader at all. It gave us a bit of a puzzle. Marten had only found one set of tracks leading away from the camp, those of the escaped sentry. None of us could guess where the leader had gone.\nTo me it was a puzzle and an annoyance, as I had been wanting to get a clearer look at his face. Dedan and Hespe believed he\u2019d simply escaped in the chaos following the lighting, maybe using the stream to avoid leaving tracks.\nMarten, however, grew distinctly uneasy when we didn\u2019t find his body. He murmured something about demons and refused to go near the wreckage. I thought he was being a superstitious fool, but I won\u2019t deny that I found the missing body more than slightly unnerving as well.\nInside the ruined tent we found a table, a cot, a desk, and a pair of chairs, all shattered and useless. In the ruined desk there were some papers I would have given a good deal to read, but they had spent too long in the wet, and the ink had run. There was also a heavy hardwood box slightly smaller than a loaf of bread. Alveron\u2019s family crest was enameled on the cover, and it was locked tight.\nBoth Hespe and Marten admitted they had a little skill at opening locks,", "and, since I was curious about what was inside, I let them have a go so long as they didn\u2019t damage the lock. Each of them took a long turn at it, but neither met with any success.\nAfter about twenty minutes of careful fiddling, Marten threw up his hands. \u201cI can\u2019t find the trick for it,\u201d he said as he stretched, pressing his hands against the small of his back.\n\u201cI might as well have a try myself,\u201d I said. I\u2019d hoped one of them would trick it open. Picking locks is not the sort of skill an arcanist should pride himself on. It didn\u2019t fit with the reputation I was hoping to build for myself.\n\u201cWill you now?\u201d Hespe said, raising an eyebrow at me. \u201cYou really are a young Taborlin.\u201d\nI thought back to the story Marten had told days before. \u201cOf course,\u201d I laughed, then shouted, \u201cEdro!\u201d in my best Taborlin the Great voice and struck the top of the box with my hand.\nThe lid sprung open.\nI was surprised as everyone else, but I hid it better. What had obviously happened is that one of them had actually tripped the lock, but the lid had been stuck. Probably the wood had swollen as it lay for days in the damp. When I\u2019d struck it, it had simply come loose.\nBut they didn\u2019t know that. From the looks on their faces you would think I had just transmuted gold in front of them. Even Tempi raised an eyebrow.\n\u201cNice trick, Taborlin,\u201d Hespe said, as if she weren\u2019t sure if I were playing a joke on them.\nI decided to hold my tongue and slid my set of makeshift lockpicks back into the pocket of my cloak. If I was going to be an arcanist, I might as well be a famous arcanist.\nDoing my best to radiate an air of solemn power, I lifted the lid and looked inside. The first thing I saw was a thick, folded piece of paper. I pulled it out.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Dedan asked.\nI held it for all of them to see. It was a careful map of the surrounding area, featuring not only an accurate depiction of the curving highway, but the locations of nearby farms and streams. Crosson, Fenhill, and the Pennysworth Inn were marked and labeled on the western road.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Dedan asked, gesturing with a thick finger to an unlabeled X deep in the forest on the south side of the road.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s this camp,\u201d Marten said, pointing. \u201cRight next to that stream.\u201d I nodded. \u201cIf this is right, we\u2019re closer to Crosson than I thought. We could", "just head southeast from here, and save ourselves more than a day\u2019s walking.\u201d I looked at Marten. \u201cDoes that seem right to you?\u201d\n\u201cHere. Let me see.\u201d I handed him the map and he looked it over. \u201cIt looks like it,\u201d he agreed. \u201cI didn\u2019t think we had come that far south. We\u2019d save at least two dozen miles going that way.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s no small blessing,\u201d Hespe said, rubbing at her bandaged leg. \u201cThat is, unless one of you gentlemen would like to carry me.\u201d\nI turned my attention back to the lockbox. It was full of tightly wrapped cloth packages. Lifting one out, I saw the glint of gold.\nThere was a murmur from everyone present. I checked the rest of the small, heavy bundles and was greeted with more coins, all gold. At a rough count, there were over two hundred royals. While I\u2019d never actually held one, I knew a single gold royal was worth eighty bits, almost as much as the Maer had given me to finance this entire trip. No wonder the Maer had been eager to stop the waylaying of his tax collectors.\nI juggled numbers in my head, converting the contents of the box to a more familiar currency and came up with more than five hundred silver talents. Enough money to buy a good-sized roadside inn, or an entire farmstead with all the livestock and equipage included. With that much money you could buy yourself a minor title, a court appointment, or an officer\u2019s position in the military.\nI saw everyone else making their own calculations. \u201cHow about we share a little bit of that around?\u201d Dedan said without much hope.\nI hesitated, then reached into the box. \u201cDoes a royal each seem fair to everyone?\u201d\nEveryone was silent as I unwrapped one of the bundles. Dedan looked at me incredulously. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d\nI handed him a heavy coin. \u201cThe way I see it, less scrupulous people might forget to tell Alveron about this. Or they\u2019d never go back to Alveron at all. I think a royal each is a good reward for us being such honest folk.\u201d I tossed Marten and Hespe a bright gold coin each.\n\u201cBesides,\u201d I added, tossing a royal to Tempi. \u201cI was hired to find a group of bandits, not destroy a minor military encampment.\u201d I held up my royal. \u201cThis is our bonus for services beyond the call of duty.\u201d I slid it into my pocket and patted it. \u201cAlveron need never know about it.\u201d\nDedan laughed and clapped me on the back. \u201cYou\u2019re not so much different from the rest of us after all,\u201d he said.", "I returned his smile and pressed the lid of the box closed, hearing the lock click tightly into place.\nI didn\u2019t mention the two other reasons for what I did. First, I was effectively buying their loyalty. They couldn\u2019t help but realize how easy it would be to simply grab the box and disappear. The thought had crossed my mind, too. Five hundred talents would pay my way through the University for the next ten years with plenty to spare.\nNow, however, they were considerably richer, and they got to feel honest about it. A heavy piece of gold would keep their minds off the money I was carrying. Though I still planned on sleeping with the locked box under my pillow at night.\nSecond, I could use the money. Both the royal I had tucked openly into my pocket, and the other three I\u2019d palmed when handing out coins to the others. As I said, Alveron would never know the difference, and four royals would cover a full term\u2019s tuition at the University.\nAfter I secured the Maer\u2019s lockbox in the bottom of my travelsack, each of us decided what we would scavenge from the bandits\u2019 equipment.\nThe tents we left for the same reason we hadn\u2019t brought our own in the first place. They were too bulky to carry. We took as much of their food as we could stow, knowing the more we carried, the less we would have to buy.\nI decided to take one of the bandits\u2019 swords. I wouldn\u2019t have wasted the money to buy one, since I didn\u2019t know how to use it, but if they were free for the taking....\nAs I was looking over the assorted weapons, Tempi came over and gave a few words of advice. After we had narrowed my options to two swords, Tempi finally spoke his mind. \u201cYou cannot use a sword.\u201d Questioning. Embarrassment.\nI got the impression that to him, the thought of someone not being able to use a sword was more than slightly shameful. Like not knowing how to eat using a knife and fork. \u201cNo,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cBut I was hoping you could show me.\u201d\nTempi stood very still and quiet. I might have taken it for a refusal if I had not come to know him so well. This type of stillness meant he was thinking.\n \nPauses are a key part of Ademic conversation, so I waited patiently. The two of us stood quietly for a minute, then two. Then five. Then ten. I fought to stay still and quiet. Perhaps this was a polite refusal.\nI thought myself terribly savvy, you see. I had known Tempi for nearly a month, learned a thousand words and fifty pieces of the Adem hand-speech. I knew the Adem were not bashful about nudity, or touching, and I was beginning to grasp the mystery that was the Lethani.\nOh yes, I thought I was terribly clever. Had I truly known anything about the Adem, I never would have dared to ask Tempi such a question.\n\u201cWill you teach me that?\u201d He pointed across the camp to where my lute case lay, leaning against a tree.\nI was caught off guard by the question. I had never tried to teach anyone how to play the lute before. Perhaps Tempi knew this and was implying something similar about himself. I knew he was prone to subtly layered speaking.\nA fair offer. I nodded. \u201cI will try.\u201d\nTempi nodded and pointed to one of the swords we had been considering. \u201cWear it. But no fighting.\u201d With that he turned and left. At the time I took this for his natural brevity.\nThe scavenging continued throughout the day. Marten took a good number of arrows and all the bowstrings he could find. Then, after checking to see no one wanted any of them, he decided to take the four longbows that had survived the lightning. They made an awkward bundle, but he claimed they\u2019d be worth a heavy penny when he sold them in Crosson.\nDedan grabbed a pair of boots and an armored vest nicer than the one he was wearing. He also laid claim to a deck of cards and a set of ivory dice.\nHespe took a slender set of shepherd\u2019s pipes and tucked almost a dozen knives into the bottom of her pack with the hope of selling them later.\nEven Tempi found some things he fancied: a whetstone, a brass saltbox, and a pair of linen pants he took down to the stream and dyed a familiar blood-red.\nI took less than the rest of them. A small knife to replace the one I\u2019d broken and a small shaving razor with a horn handle. I didn\u2019t need to shave that often, but I\u2019d gotten into the habit while in the Maer\u2019s court. I might have followed Hespe\u2019s example and taken a few knives as well, but my travelsack was already unpleasantly heavy with the weight of the Maer\u2019s lockbox.\nThis may seem a little ghoulish, but it is simply the way of the world.", "Looters become looted, while time and tide make us mercenaries all.", ""], "CHAPTER NINETY-FOUR": ["CHAPTER NINETY-FOUR\nOver Rock and Root\nWE DECIDED TO TRUST the map we\u2019d found and cut straight west through the forest, heading toward Crosson. Even if we missed the town, we couldn\u2019t help but hit the road and save ourselves long miles of walking.\nHespe\u2019s wounded leg made the going slow, and we only put six or seven miles behind us that first day. It was during one of our many breaks that Tempi began my true instruction in the Ketan.\nFool that I was, I\u2019d assumed he had already been teaching me. The truth was, he had merely been correcting my more horrifying mistakes because they irritated him. Much the same way I\u2019d be tempted to tune someone\u2019s lute if they were playing off-key in the same room.\nThis instruction was a different thing entirely. We started at the beginning of the Ketan and he corrected my mistakes. All my mistakes. He found eighteen in the first motion alone, and there are more than a hundred motions in the Ketan. I quickly began to have doubts about this apprenticeship.\nI also began to teach Tempi the lute. I played notes as we walked, and taught him their names, then showed him some chords. It seemed as good a place as any to begin.\nWe hoped to make it to Crosson by noon of the next day. But near midmorning we encountered a stretch of dreary, reeking swamp that hadn\u2019t been marked on the map.\nThus began a truly miserable day. We had to test our footing with every step, and our progress slowed to a crawl. At one point Dedan startled and fell, thrashing about and spattering the rest of us with brackish water. He said he\u2019d seen a mosquito bigger than his thumb with a sucker like a woman\u2019s hairpin. I suggested it might have been a sipquick. He suggested several unpleasant, unsanitary things I could do to myself at my earliest convenience.\nAs the afternoon wore on, we gave up on making it back to the road and focused on more immediate things, such as finding a piece of dry ground where we could sit without sinking. But all we found was more marsh,", "sinkholes, and clouds of keening mosquitoes and biting flies.\nThe sun began to set before we finally made our way out of the swamp,\nand the weather quickly turned from hot and muggy to chill and damp. We trudged until the ground finally began to slope upward. And though we were all weary and wet, we unanimously decided to press on and put a little distance between ourselves and the insects and smell of rotting plants.\nThe moon was full, giving us more than enough light to pick our way through the trees. Despite the miserable day, our spirits began to rise. Hespe had grown tired enough to lean on Dedan, and as the mud-covered mercenary put an arm around her she told him he hadn\u2019t smelled this good in months. He replied that he would have to bow to the judgment of a woman of such obvious grace.\nI tensed, waiting for their banter to turn sour and sarcastic. But as I plodded along behind them I noticed how gently he had his arm around her. Hespe leaned on him almost tenderly, hardly favoring her wounded leg at all. I glanced at Marten, and the old tracker smiled, his teeth white in the moonlight.\nBefore long we found a clear stream and washed the worst of the smell and mud away. We rinsed out our clothes and donned dry ones. I unpacked my tatty, threadbare cloak and fastened it across my chest, vainly hoping it might keep away the evening\u2019s chill.\nAs we were finishing up, we heard the faint sound of singing upstream. Each of us pricked up our ears, but the chattering sound of the stream made it difficult to hear with any clarity.\nBut singing meant people, and people meant we were almost to Crosson, or perhaps even the Pennysworth if the swamp had turned us too far south. Even a farmhouse would be better than another night in the rough.\nSo, despite the fact that we were tired and aching, the hope of soft beds, warm meals, and cool drinks gave us energy to gather up our packs and press on.\nWe followed the stream, Dedan and Hespe still walking as a pair. The sound of singing came and went. The recent rains meant the stream was running high, and the noise of it tumbling over rock and root was sometimes enough to drown out even the sound of our own footsteps.\nEventually the stream grew broad and still as the heavy brush thinned and opened into a wide clearing.\nThere was no singing any longer. Nor did we see a road, inn, or any flicker", "of firelight. Just a wide clearing well-lit by moonlight. The stream broadened out, forming a bright pool. And sitting on a smooth rock by the side of the pool....\n\u201cLord Tehlu protect me from the demons of the night,\u201d Marten said woodenly. But he sounded more reverent than afraid. And he did not look away.\n\u201cThat\u2019s ...\u201d Dedan said weakly. \u201cThat\u2019s ...\u201d\n\u201cI do not believe in faeries,\u201d I tried to say, but it came out as barely a whisper.\nIt was Felurian.", ""], "CHAPTER NINETY-FIVE": ["CHAPTER NINETY-FIVE\nChased\nTHE FIVE OF US stood frozen for a moment. The slow rippling of the pool reflected onto the fair form of Felurian. Naked in the moonlight, she sang:\ncae-lanion luhial di mari felanua kreata tu ciar\ntu alaran di. dirella. amauen. loesi an delian tu nia vor ruhlan Felurian thae.\nThe sound of her voice was strange. It was soft and gentle, far too quiet for us to hear across the entire length of the clearing. Far too faint for us to hear over the sound of moving water and stirring leaves. Despite this, I could hear it. Her words were clear and sweet as the rising and falling notes of a distant flute. It reminded me of something I could not press my finger to.\nThe tune was the same Dedan had sung in his story. I did not understand a word of it save her name in the final line. Nevertheless I felt the draw of it, inexplicable and insistent. As if an unseen hand had reached into my chest and tried to pull me into the clearing by my heart.\nI resisted. I looked away and set one hand against a nearby tree to steady myself.\nBehind me I heard Marten murmuring, \u201cNo no no,\u201d in a low voice as if he were trying to convince himself. \u201cNo no no no no. Not for all the money in the world.\u201d\nI looked over my shoulder. The tracker\u2019s eyes were fixed feverishly on the clearing in front of him, but he seemed more afraid than aroused. Tempi stood, surprise plain on his normally impassive face. Dedan stood rigidly to", "one side, his face drawn while Hespe\u2019s eyes darted back and forth between him and the clearing.\nThen Felurian began to sing again. It felt like the promise of a warm hearth on a cold night. It was like a young girl\u2019s smile. I found myself thinking of Losi at the Pennysworth, her red curls like a tumble of fire. I remembered the swell of her breasts and the way her hand had felt running through my hair.\nFelurian sang, and I felt the pull of it. It was strong, but not so strong that I couldn\u2019t hold myself back. I looked into the clearing again and saw her, skin silver-white under the evening sky. She bent to dip one hand in the water of the pool, more graceful than a dancer.\nA sudden clarity of thought came over me. What was I afraid of? A faerie story? There was magic here, real magic. What\u2019s more, it was a magic of singing. If I missed this opportunity I would never forgive myself.\nI looked back again at my companions. Marten was shaking visibly. Tempi was backing slowly away. Dedan\u2019s hands made fists at his sides. Was I going to be like them, superstitious and afraid? No. Never. I was of the Arcanum. I was a namer. I was one of the Edema Ruh.\nI felt wild laughter boil up in me. \u201cI will meet you at the Pennysworth in three days\u2019 time,\u201d I said, and stepped into the clearing.\nI felt Felurian\u2019s pull more strongly now. Her skin was bright in the moonlight. Her long hair fell like a shadow all around her.\n\u201cSod this,\u201d I heard Dedan say behind me. \u201cIf he\u2019s going, then I\u2019m g\u2014\u201d There was a short scuffle ending with the sound of something hitting the ground. I glanced behind me and saw him facedown on the low grass. Hespe had her knee on the small of his back and one of his arms pulled up tight behind him. He was struggling weakly and cursing strongly.\nTempi watched them impassively, as if scoring a wrestling bout. Marten was gesturing frantically in my direction. \u201cKid,\u201d he hissed urgently. \u201cGet back here! Kid! Come back!\u201d\nI turned back to the stream. Felurian was watching me. Even from a hundred feet away, I could see her eyes, dark and curious. Her mouth spread into a wide, dangerous smile. She laughed a wild laugh. It was bright and delighted. It was no human sound.\nThen she darted across the clearing, swift as a sparrow, graceful as a deer. I leapt to the chase, and despite the weight of my travelsack and the sword at my hip, I moved so quickly my cloak flared like a flag behind me. Never have I run like that before, and never since. It was the way a child runs, light", "and quick, without the least fear of falling.\nFelurian ahead of me. Into the scrub. I dimly remember trees, the smell of\nearth, the grey of moonlit stone. She laughs. She dodges, dances, pulls ahead. She waits till I am almost close enough to touch, then skips away. She shines in the light of the moon. There are clutching branches, a spray of water, a warm wind ...\nAnd I have hold of her. Her hands are tangled in my hair, pulling me close. Her mouth eager. Her tongue shy and darting. Her breath in my mouth, filling my head. The hot tips of her breasts brush my chest. The smell of her like clover, like musk, like ripe apples fallen to the ground ...\nAnd there is no hesitation. No doubt. I know exactly what to do. My hands are on the back of her neck. Brushing her face. Tangled in her hair. Sliding along the smooth length of her thigh. Grabbing her hard by the flank. Circling her narrow waist. Lifting her. Laying her down ...\nAnd she writhes beneath me, lithe and languorous. Slow and sighing. Her legs around me. Her back arches. Her hot hands clutch my shoulders, my arms, pressing the small of my back ...\nAnd she is astride me. Her movements wild. Her long hair trails across my skin. She tosses her head, trembling and shaking, crying out in a language I do not know. Her sharp nails digging into the flat muscles of my chest ...\nAnd there is music to it. The wordless cries she makes, rising and falling. Her sigh. My racing heart. Her motion slows. I clutch her hips in frantic counterpoint. Our rhythm is like a silent song. Like sudden thunder. Like the half-heard thrumming of a distant drum ...\nAnd everything stops. All of me arches. I am taut as a lute string. Trembling. Aching. I am tuned too tight, and I am breaking....", ""], "CHAPTER NINETY-SIX": ["CHAPTER NINETY-SIX\nThe Fire Itself\nI WOKE WITH SOMETHING BRUSHING at the edges of my memory. I opened my eyes and saw trees stretched against a twilight sky. There were silken pillows all around me, while a few feet away Felurian lay, her naked body loosely splayed in sleep.\nShe looked smooth and perfect as a sculpture. She sighed in her sleep, and I chided myself for the thought. I knew she was nothing like cold stone. She was warm and supple, the smoothest marble grindstone by comparison.\nMy hand reached out to touch her, but I stopped myself, not wanting to disturb the perfect scene before me. A distant thought began to nag at me, but I brushed it away like an irritating fly.\nFelurian\u2019s lips parted and sighed, making a sound like a dove. I remembered the touch of those lips. I ached, and forced myself to look away from her soft, flower-petal mouth.\nHer closed eyelids were patterned like a butterfly\u2019s wings, swept in whorls of deep purple and black with traceries of pale gold that blended to the color of her skin. As her eyes moved gently in sleep, the pattern shifted, as if the butterfly fanned its wings. That sight alone was probably worth the price all men must pay for seeing it.\nI ate her with my eyes, knowing all the songs and stories I had heard were nothing. She is what men dream of. All the places I have been, all the women I have seen, I have met her equal only once.\nSomething in my mind screamed at me, but I was bemused by the motion of her eyes beneath her lids, the shape her mouth made, as if she would kiss me even while she slept. I swatted the thought away again, irritated.\nI was going to go mad, or die.\nThe idea finally fought its way through to my conscious mind, and I felt every hair on my body stand suddenly on end. I had a moment of perfect, clear lucidity that resembled coming up for air and quickly closed my eyes, trying to lower myself into the Heart of Stone.", "It didn\u2019t come. For the first time in my life, that cool taciturn state escaped me. Behind my eyes, Felurian distracted me. The sweet breath. The soft breast. The urgent half-despairing sighs that slipped through hungry, petal- tender lips....\nStone. I kept my eyes closed and wrapped the calm rationality of Heart of Stone around me like a mantle before I dared even think of her again.\nWhat did I know? I brought to mind a hundred stories of Felurian and plucked out the recurring themes. Felurian was beautiful. She charmed mortal men. They followed her into the Fae and died in her embrace.\nHow did they die? It was fairly simple to guess: extreme physical stress. Things had been rather rigorous, and the sedentary or frail might not have fared so well as I. Now that I stopped to notice, my entire body felt like a well-wrung rag. My shoulders ached, my knees burned, and my neck bore the sweet bruising of love bites from my right ear, down my chest, and....\nMy body flushed and I struggled deeper into the Heart of Stone until my pulse slowed and I could force the thought of her from the front of my mind.\nI could remember four stories where men had come back from the Fae alive, all of them cracked as the potter\u2019s cobbles. What manner of madness did they exhibit? Obsessive behavior, accidental death due to separation from reality, and wasting away from extreme melancholy. Three died within a span of days. The fourth story told of the man lasting nearly half a year.\nBut something didn\u2019t make sense. Admittedly, Felurian was lovely. Skilled? Without a doubt. But to the extent that every man died or went insane? No. It simply wasn\u2019t likely.\nI don\u2019t mean to belittle the experience. I don\u2019t doubt for a second that it had, quite naturally, deprived men of their faculties in the past. I, however, knew myself to be quite sane.\nI briefly entertained the notion that I was insane and didn\u2019t know it. Then I considered the possibility that I had always been insane, acknowledged it as more likely than the former, then pushed both thoughts from my mind.\nEyes still closed, I lay there, enjoying a quiet languor of a sort I\u2019d never felt before. I savored the moment, then opened my eyes and prepared to make my escape.\nI looked around the pavilion at silken draperies and scattered cushions. These were only ornaments for Felurian. She lay in the middle of it all, all rounded hip and slender leg and lithe muscle shifting underneath her skin.\nShe was watching me.", "If she was beautiful at rest she was doubly so awake. Asleep she was a painting of a fire. Awake she was the fire itself.\nIt may seem strange to you that at this point I felt fear. It may seem strange that only an arm\u2019s length from the most attractive woman in the world, I was suddenly reminded of my own mortality.\nShe smiled like a knife in velvet and stretched like a cat in the sun.\nHer body was built to stretch, the arch of her back, the smooth expanse of her belly going taut. The round fullness of her breasts was lifted by the motion of her arms, and suddenly I felt like a stag in rut. My body reacted to her, and I felt as if someone were hammering at the cool impassivity of Heart of Stone with a hot poker. My control slipped for a moment, and a less disciplined piece of my mind started composing a song to her.\nI couldn\u2019t spare the attention to rein that piece of myself back in. So I focused on staying safe in the Heart of Stone, ignoring both her body and that nattering part of my mind forming rhyming couplets somewhere in the back of my head.\nIt wasn\u2019t the easiest thing to do. As a matter of fact, it made the ordinary rigors of sympathy seem simple as skipping. If not for the training I\u2019d received at the University, I would have been a broken, pitiful thing, only able to concentrate on my own captivation.\nFelurian slowly relaxed out of her stretch and looked at me with ancient eyes. Eyes unlike anything I had ever seen. They were a striking color ...\nThe summer dusk was in her eyes\n... a sort of twilight blue. They were fascinating. In fact ...\nWith lids of winged butterflies\n... there wasn\u2019t any white to them at all....\nHer lips the shade of sunset skies\nI clenched my jaw, split that chattering piece of myself away, and walled it off in a distant corner of my mind, letting it sing to itself.\nFelurian tilted her head to one side. Her eyes were as intent and expressionless as a bird\u2019s. \u201cwhy are you so quiet, flame lover? have I quenched you?\u201d\nHer voice was odd to my ear. It had no rough edges to it at all. It was all quiet smoothness, like a piece of perfectly polished glass. Despite its odd softness, Felurian\u2019s voice ran down my spine, making me feel like a cat that\u2019s just been stroked down to the tip of its tail.\nI retreated further into the Heart of Stone, felt it cool and reassuring around", "me. However, while the majority of my attention was focused on self-control, the small, mad, lyric part of my mind leapt to the fore and said: \u201cNever quenched. Though I am doused in you, I burn. The motion of your turning head is like a song. Is like a spark. Is like a breath that billows me and fans to flame a fire that cannot help but spread and roar your name.\u201d\nFelurian\u2019s face lit up. \u201ca poet! I should have known you for a poet by how your body moved.\u201d\nThe gentle hush of her voice caught me unprepared again. It wasn\u2019t that her words were breathy, or husky, or sultry. It was nothing so tawdry or affected as that. But when she spoke, I couldn\u2019t help but be aware of the fact that her breath was pressed from her breast, past the soft sweetness of her throat, then shaped by the careful play of lips and teeth and tongue.\nShe came closer, moving on her hands and knees through the pillows. \u201cyou looked like a poet, fiery and fair.\u201d Her voice was no louder than a breath as she cupped my face with her hands. \u201cpoets are gentler. they say nice things.\u201d\nThere was only one person I\u2019d ever heard whose voice was similar to this. Elodin. On rare occasions his voice would fill the air as if the world itself were listening.\nFelurian\u2019s voice was not resonant. It did not fill the forest glade. Hers was the hush before a sudden summer storm. It was soft as a brushing feather. It made my heart step sideways in my chest.\nSpeaking thus, when she called me a poet, it did not raise my hackles or make me grit my teeth. From her, it sounded like the sweetest thing a man was ever called. Such was the power of her voice.\nFelurian brushed her fingertips across my lips. \u201cpoet kisses are best. you kiss me like a candle flame.\u201d She brought one of her hands back to touch her mouth, her eyes bright at the memory.\nI took her hand and pressed it tenderly. My hands have always seemed graceful, but next to hers, they looked brutish and crude. I breathed against her palm as I spoke. \u201cYour kisses are like sunlight on my lips.\u201d\nShe lowered her eyes, butterfly wings dancing. I felt my mindless need for her slacken and began to understand. This was magic, but nothing like what I knew. Not sympathy or sygaldry. Felurian made men mad with desire the same way I gave off body heat. It was natural for her, but she could control it.\nHer gaze wandered over my tangle of clothes and belongings strewn messily at one corner of the glade. They looked oddly out of place amid the silks and soft colors. I saw her eyes settle on my lute case. She froze.", "\u201cis my flame a sweet poet? does he sing?\u201d Her voice trembled and I could feel a tenseness in her body as she waited for an answer. She looked back at me. I smiled.\nFelurian scampered off and brought back my lute case like a child with a new toy. As I took it, I saw her eyes were wide and ... wet?\nI looked into her eyes, and in a flash of understanding I realized what her life must be like. A thousand years old, and lonely from time to time. If she wanted companionship she had to seduce and lure. And for what? An evening of company? An hour? How long could an average man last before his will broke and he became as mindless as a fawning dog? Not long.\nAnd who would she meet in the forest? Farmers and hunters? What entertainment could they provide, slaved to her passions? I felt a moment of pity for her. I know what loneliness is like.\nI took the lute from its case and began to tune it. I struck an experimental chord and carefully tuned it again. What to play for the most beautiful woman in the world?\nIt wasn\u2019t hard to decide, actually. My father had taught me to judge an audience. I struck up \u201cSisters Flin.\u201d If you\u2019ve never heard of it, I\u2019m not surprised. It\u2019s a bright and lively song about two sisters gossiping while they argue over the price of butter.\nMost people want to hear stories of legendary adventure and romance. But what do you play for someone out of legend? What do you sing for a woman who has been the object of romance for a mortal age? You play her songs of ordinary people. So I hoped.\nShe clapped delightedly at the end of it. \u201cmore! more?\u201d She smiled hopefully, cocking her head to make it a request. Her eyes were wide and eager and adoring.\nI played her \u201cLarm and His Alepot.\u201d I played her \u201cBlacksmith\u2019s Daughters.\u201d I played her a ridiculous song about a priest chasing a cow that I\u2019d written when I was ten and never even named.\nFelurian laughed and applauded. She covered her mouth in shock and her eyes in embarrassment. The more I played, the more she reminded me of a young country wife attending her first fair, full of pure joy, face shining with innocent delight, eyes wide in amazement at everything she sees.\nAnd lovely, of course. I concentrated on my fingering so as not to think about it.\nAfter each song she rewarded me with a kiss that made it difficult to decide", "what to play next. Not that I minded horribly. I\u2019d come to realize rather quickly that I preferred kisses to coins.\nI played her \u201cTinker Tanner.\u201d Let me tell you, the image of Felurian, her quiet, fluting voice singing the chorus of my favorite drinking song is something that will never, never leave me. Not until I die.\nAll the while I felt the charm she had on me slacken, bit by bit. It gave me room to breathe. I relaxed and let myself slide a little farther out of the Heart of Stone. Dispassionate calm can be a useful frame of mind, but it does not make for a compelling performance.\nI played for hours, and by the end of it I felt like myself again. By which I mean I could look at Felurian with no more reaction than you might normally feel, looking at the most beautiful woman in the world.\nI can still remember her, sitting naked among the cushions, twilight- colored butterflies dancing in the air between us. I wouldn\u2019t have been alive had I not been aroused. But my mind seemed to be my own again, and I was grateful for that.\nShe made a disappointed noise of protest as I set the lute back into its case. \u201care you weary?\u201d she asked with a hint of a smile. \u201cI would not have tired you, sweet poet, had I known.\u201d\nI gave my best apologetic smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but it seems to be getting late.\u201d Actually, the sky still showed the same purple hint of twilight it had since I first woke, but I pushed on. \u201cI\u2019ll need to be moving quickly if I\u2019m to meet ...\u201d\nMy mind went numb as quickly as if I\u2019d been struck a blow to the back of my head. I felt the passion, fierce and insatiable. I felt the need to have her, to crush her body to mine, to taste the savage sweetness of her mouth.\nOnly because of my arcane training did I hold onto any concept of my own identity at all. Even so, I only held it with my barest fingertips.\nFelurian sat cross-legged on the cushions across from me, her face angry and terrible, her eyes cold and hard as distant stars. With a deliberate calm she brushed a slowly fanning butterfly from her shoulder. There was such a weight of fury in her simple gesture that my stomach clenched and I realized this fact:\nNo one ever left Felurian. Ever. She kept men until their bodies and minds broke beneath the strain of loving her. She kept them until she tired of them, and when she sent them away it was the leaving that drove men mad.\nI was powerless. I was a novelty. I was a toy, favorite because it was", "newest. It might be a long while before she tired of me, but the time would come. And when she finally set me free my mind would tear itself apart with wanting her.", ""], "CHAPTER NINETY-SEVEN": ["CHAPTER NINETY-SEVEN\nBlood and Bitter Rue\nASISAT AMONG the silks with my control slipping away, I felt a wave of cold sweat sweep over my body. I clenched my jaw and felt a small anger flare up. Over the course of my life my mind has been the only thing I\u2019ve always been able to rely on, the only thing that has always been entirely mine.\nI could feel my resolve melting as my natural desires were replaced by some animal thing unable to think beyond its own lust.\nThe part of me that was still Kvothe raged, but I felt my body respond to her presence. With a horrible fascination I felt myself crawl through the cushions toward her. One arm found her slender waist, and I bent to kiss her with a terrible hunger.\nI howled inside my own mind. I have been beaten and whipped, starved and stabbed. But my mind is my own, no matter what becomes of this body or the world around. I threw myself against the bars of an intangible cage made of moonlight and desire.\nAnd, somehow, I held myself away from her. My breath tore out of my throat as if racing to escape.\nFelurian reclined on the cushions, her head tilted up toward me. Her lips were pale and perfect. Her eyes half-lidded and hungry.\nI forced myself to look away from her face, but there was nowhere safe to look. Her throat was smooth and delicate, trembling with her rapid pulse. One breast stood round and full, while the other angled slightly to one side, following the downward slope of her body. They rose and fell with her breath, moving gently, making candle-cast shadows on her skin. I glimpsed the perfect whiteness of her teeth behind the pale pink of her parted lips....\nI closed my eyes, but somehow that only made it worse. The heat of her body was like standing near a fire. The skin of her waist was soft beneath my hand. She moved beneath me, and her breast brushed softly against my chest. I felt her breath against my neck. I shivered and began to sweat.", "I opened my eyes again and saw her staring at me. Her expression was innocent, almost hurt, as if she couldn\u2019t understand being refused. I nursed my small flame of anger. No one did this to me. No one. I held myself away from her. A slight line of a frown touched her forehead, as if she were annoyed, or angry, or concentrating.\nFelurian reached up to touch my face, her eyes intent as if trying to read something written deep inside me. I tried to pull back, remembering her touch, but my body simply shook. Beads of sweat fell from my skin to patter gently on the silk cushions and the flat plane of her stomach below.\nShe touched my cheek softly. Softly, I bent to kiss her, and something broke in my mind.\nI felt the snap as four years of my life slid away. Suddenly I was back on the streets of Tarbean. Three boys, bigger than me with greasy hair and piggish eyes had dragged me from the broken crate where I\u2019d been sleeping. Two of them held me down, pinning my arms. I lay in a stagnant puddle that was bitterly cold. It was early in the morning and the stars were out.\nOne of them had his hand over my mouth. It didn\u2019t matter. I had been in the city for months. I knew better than to yell for help. At best no one would come. At worst someone would, and then there would be more of them.\nTwo of them held me down. The third cut my clothes off my body. He cut me. They told me what they were going to do. Their breath was horribly warm against my face. They laughed.\nThere in Tarbean, half-naked and helpless, I felt something well up inside me. I bit two fingers off the hand over my mouth. I heard a scream and swearing as one of them staggered away. I strained and strained against the one who was still on top of me. I heard my own arm break, and his grip loosened. I started to howl.\nI threw him off. Still screaming I stood, my clothes hanging in rags around me. I knocked one of them to the ground. My scrabbling hand found a loose cobblestone and I used it to break one of his legs. I remember the noise it made. I flailed until his arms were broken, then I broke his head.\nWhen I looked up, I saw the one who had cut me was gone. The third huddled against a wall. He clutched his bloody hand to his chest. His eyes were white and wild. Then I heard footsteps approaching, and I dropped the stone and ran and ran and ran....\nSuddenly, years later, I was that feral boy again. I jerked my head back and snarled inside my mind. I felt something deep inside myself. I reached for it.", "A tense stillness settled inside of me, the sort of silence that comes before a thunderclap. I felt the air begin to crystallize around me.\nI felt cold. Detachedly, I gathered up the pieces of my mind and fit them all together. I was Kvothe the trouper, Edema Ruh born. I was Kvothe the student, Re\u2019lar under Elodin. I was Kvothe the musician. I was Kvothe.\nI stood above Felurian.\nI felt as if this was the only time in my life I had been fully awake. Everything looked clear and sharp, as if I was seeing with a new set of eyes. As if I wasn\u2019t bothering with my eyes at all, and was looking at the world directly with my mind.\nThe sleeping mind, some piece of me realized faintly. No longer sleeping, I thought and smiled.\nI looked at Felurian, and in that moment I understood her down to the bottoms of her feet. She was of the Fae. She did not worry over right or wrong. She was a creature of pure desire, much like a child. A child does not concern itself with consequence, neither does a sudden storm. Felurian resembled both, and neither. She was ancient and innocent and powerful and proud.\nWas this the way Elodin saw the world? Was this the magic he spoke of? Not secrets or tricks, but Taborlin the Great magic. Always there, but beyond my seeing until now?\nIt was beautiful.\nI met Felurian\u2019s eyes and the world grew slow and sluggish. I felt as if I had been thrust underwater, as if my breath had been pressed from my body. For that tiny moment I was stunned and numb as if I had been struck by lightning.\nThe moment passed and things began to move again. But now, looking into Felurian\u2019s twilight eyes, I understood her far beyond the bottoms of her feet. Now I knew her to the marrow of her bones. Her eyes were like four lines of music, clearly penned. My mind was filled with the sudden song of her. I drew a breath and sang it out in four hard notes.\nFelurian sat upright. She passed her hand before her eyes and spoke a word as sharp as shattered glass. There was a pain like thunder in my head. Darkness flickered at the edges of my sight. I tasted blood and bitter rue.\nThe world snapped back into focus, and I caught myself before I fell. Felurian frowned. Straightened. Stood. Her face intent, she took a step. Standing, she was not tall or terrible. Her head was barely level with my", "chin. Her dark hair hung, a sheaf of shadow, straight as a knife until it brushed against her curving hip. She was slight, and pale, and perfect. Never have I seen a face so sweet, a mouth so made for kissing. She was no longer frowning. Not smiling either. Her lips were soft and slightly parted.\nShe took another step. The simple motion of her moving leg was like a dance, the unexaggerated shifting of her hip entrancing as a fire. The arch of her bare foot said more of sex than anything I\u2019d seen in my young life.\nAnother step. Her smile was fierce and full. She was as lovely as the moon. Her power hung about her like a mantle. It shook the air. It spread behind her like a pair of vast and unseen wings.\nClose enough to touch, I felt her power thrumming in the air. Desire rose around me like the sea in storm. She raised her hand. She touched my chest. I shook.\nShe met my eyes, and in the twilight written there I saw again the four clear lines of song.\nI sang them out. They burst from me like birds into the open air.\nSuddenly my mind was clear again. I drew a breath and held her eyes in mine. I sang again, and this time I was full of rage. I shouted out the four hard notes of song. I sang them tight and white and hard as iron. And at the sound of them, I felt her power shake then shatter, leaving nothing in the empty air but ache and anger.\nFelurian gave a startled cry and sat so suddenly that it was almost like a fall. She curled her knees toward herself and huddled, watching me with wide and frightened eyes.\nLooking around, I saw the wind. Not the way you might see smoke or fog, I saw the ever-changing wind itself. It was familiar as the face of a forgotten friend. I laughed and spread my arms, marveling at its shifting shape.\nI cupped my hands and breathed a sigh into the hollow space within. I spoke a name. I moved my hands and wove my breath gossamer-thin. It billowed out, engulfing her, then burst into a silver flame that trapped her tight inside its changing name.\nI held her there above the ground. She watched me with an air of fear and disbelief, her dark hair dancing like a second flame inside the first.\nI knew then that I could kill her. It would be as simple as throwing a sheet of paper to the wind. But the thought sickened me, and I was reminded of ripping the wings from a butterfly. Killing her would be destroying something strange and wonderful. A world without Felurian was a poorer", "world. A world I would like a little less. It would be like breaking Illien\u2019s lute. It would be like burning down a library in addition to ending a life.\nOn the other hand, my safety and sanity were at stake. I believed the world was more interesting with Kvothe in it as well.\nBut I couldn\u2019t kill her. Not like this. Not wielding my newfound magic like a dissecting knife.\nI spoke again, and the wind brought her down among the pillows. I made a tearing motion and the silver flame that once had been my breath became three notes of broken song and went to play among the trees.\nI sat. She reclined. We looked each other over for several long minutes. Her eyes flashed from fear to caution to curiosity. I saw myself reflected in her eyes, naked among the cushions. My power rode like a white star on my brow.\nThen I began to feel a fading. A forgetting. I realized the name of the wind no longer filled my mouth, and when I looked around I saw nothing but empty air. I tried to remain outwardly calm, but as these things left me I felt like a lute whose strings were being cut. My heart clenched with a loss I hadn\u2019t felt since my parents died.\nI could see a slight shimmer in the air around Felurian, some shred of her power returning. I ignored it as I struggled frantically to keep some part of what I had learned. But it was like trying to hold a handful of sand. If you have ever dreamed of flying, then come awake, dismayed to realize you had lost the trick of it, you have some inkling how I felt.\nPiece by piece it faded until there was nothing left. I felt hollow inside and ached as badly as if I\u2019d discovered my family never loved me. I swallowed against the lump in my throat.\nFelurian looked at me curiously. I could still see myself reflected in her eyes, the star on my forehead no more than a pinprick of light. Then even the perfect vision of my sleeping mind began to fade. I looked desperately at the world around me. I tried to memorize the sight of it, unblinking.\nThen it was gone. I bowed my head, half in grief and half to hide the tears.", ""], "CHAPTER NINETY-EIGHT": ["CHAPTER NINETY-EIGHT\nThe Lay of Felurian\nA LONG MOMENT PASSED BEFORE I regained enough of my composure to look up. There was a hesitancy in the air, as if we were young lovers who didn\u2019t know what was expected of us next, who didn\u2019t know what parts we were supposed to play.\nI picked up my lute and brought it close to my chest. The motion was instinctive, like clutching a wounded hand. I struck a chord out of habit, then made it minor so the lute seemed to be saying sad.\nWithout thinking or looking up I began to play one of the songs I had written in the months after my parents died. It was called Sitting by the Water Remembering. My fingers strummed sorrow into the evening air. It was several minutes before I realized what I was doing, and several more before I stopped. I wasn\u2019t done with the song. I don\u2019t know if it really has an ending.\nI felt better, not good by any means, but better. Less empty. My music always helped. As long as I had my music, no burden was ever too heavy to bear.\nI looked up and saw tears on Felurian\u2019s face. It made me less ashamed of my own.\nI also felt myself wanting her. The emotion was damped by the ache in my chest, but that touch of desire focused my attention on my most immediate concern. Survival. Escape.\nFelurian seemed to reach a decision and started through the cushions toward me. Moving in a cautious crawl, she stopped several feet away and looked at me.\n\u201cdoes my tender poet have a name?\u201d Her voice was so gentle it startled me.\nI opened my mouth to speak, then stopped. I thought of the moon, caught by her own name, and a thousand faerie stories I had heard as a child. If you believed Elodin, names were the bones of the world. I hesitated for about half a second before I decided I had given Felurian a damn sight more than my name already.", "\u201cI am Kvothe.\u201d The sound of it seemed to ground me, to put me inside myself again.\n\u201ckvothe.\u201d She spoke it softly, and it reminded me of a bird calling. \u201cwould you sing sweet for me again?\u201d She reached out slowly, as if afraid of being burned, and laid her hand lightly on my arm. \u201cplease? your songs are like a caress, my kvothe.\u201d\nShe pronounced my name like the beginning of a song. It was lovely. However, I wasn\u2019t entirely comfortable with the way she referred to me as her Kvothe.\nI smiled and nodded. Mostly because I didn\u2019t have a better idea. I struck a couple of tuning chords, then paused, thinking.\nThen I started to play \u201cIn the Forest Fae,\u201d a song about, of all things, Felurian herself. It wasn\u2019t particularly good. It used about three chords and two dozen words. But it had the effect I was looking for.\nFelurian brightened at the mention of her name. There was no false modesty in her. She knew she was most beautiful, most skilled. She knew men told stories, and she knew her reputation. No man could resist her, no man could endure her. By the end of the song, pride had her sitting straighter.\nI finished the song. \u201cWould you like to hear another?\u201d I asked.\nShe nodded and grinned eagerly. She sat among the cushions, back straight, as regal as a queen.\nI moved into a second song, similar to the first. It was called \u201cLady Fae\u201d or something of the sort. I didn\u2019t know who had written it, but they had an appalling habit of sticking extra syllables into their lines. It wasn\u2019t bad enough to get anything thrown at me in a tavern, but it was close.\nI watched Felurian closely as I played. She was flattered, but I could read a slight dissatisfaction growing. As if she was irritated, but she couldn\u2019t decide why. Perfect.\nLast I played a song written for Queen Serule. I guarantee you haven\u2019t heard it, but I\u2019m sure you know the type. Written by some toadying minstrel looking for a patronage, my father had taught it to me as an example of certain things to avoid when writing a song. It was a numbing example of mediocrity. You could tell the writer was either truly inept, had never met Serule, or that he simply didn\u2019t find her attractive at all.\nWhile singing it, I simply exchanged the name Felurian for Serule. I also replaced some of the better phrases with less poetic ones. By the time I was through with it, the song was truly wretched, and Felurian wore an expression", "of naked dismay upon her face.\nI sat for a long moment, as if deeply considering something. When I finally\ndid speak, my voice was hushed and hesitant. \u201cLady, might I write a song for you?\u201d I gave her a sheepish smile.\nHer smile was like the moon through the clouds. She clapped her hands and threw herself onto me with a kittenish delight, peppering me with kisses. Only fear that my lute might be broken kept me from properly enjoying the experience.\nFelurian pulled away and sat very still. I tried a couple of chord combinations, then stilled my hands and looked up at her. \u201cI will call it \u2018The Lay of Felurian.\u2019 \u201d She blushed a bit and looked at me through lowered eyes, her expression bashful and brazen.\nAll immodest boasting aside, I write a fine song when I set my hand to it, and my skills had recently been sharpened in the Maer\u2019s employ. I am not the best, but I am one of the best. Given enough time, a worthy subject, and the proper motivation I daresay I could write a song nearly as well as Illien. Nearly.\nClosing my eyes, I coaxed sweet strains from my lute. My fingers flew, and I captured the music of wind in the branches, of rustling leaves.\nThen I looked to the back of my mind where the mad, chattering part of me had been composing a song to Felurian all this while. I brushed the strings more lightly and began to sing.\nFlashing moon silver, midnight blue her eyes The lids were subtle-colored butterflies.\nHer hair swayed, a dark scythe swinging Through the trees with the wind singing. Felurian! O Lady Fair,\nBlessed be your forest glade.\nYour breath is light upon the air. Your hair is shadow-dappled shade.\nFelurian grew still as I sang. Toward the end of the chorus I could hardly tell if she was breathing. A few of the butterflies that had been frightened away by our earlier conflict came dancing back to us. One of them landed on Felurian\u2019s hand, brushing its wings once, twice, as if curious why its mistress was so sudden still. I turned my eyes to my lute again and chose notes like", "raindrops licking the leaves of trees.\nShe danced in dancing shadows candle cast She held my eyes, my face, my form, full fast. Her smile a snare ten times as strong\nAs legendary faerie song.\nO Lady Fair! Felurian,\nYour kiss is honeysuckle sweet.\nI pity any other man\nUnknown to you and incomplete.\nI watched her from the corner of my eye. She sat as if listening with her entire body. Her eyes were wide. She\u2019d raised one hand to her mouth, upsetting the butterfly resting there, while the other pressed against her chest as she drew a slow breath. This is what I had wanted, but I regretted it nonetheless.\nI bent over my lute and danced my fingers across the strings. I wove chords like water over river stones, like a soft breath against the ear. Then I steeled myself and sang:\nHer eyes were of the bluest black\nLike night sky with the clouds blown back Her skills in love\u2014\nI stuttered my fingers on the strings, pausing for just a moment as if unsure of something. I saw Felurian wake halfway from her reverie and continued:\nHer skills in love they do suffice\nIn close embrace men find her nice. Felurian! O Mistress Bright,\nYour touch more sought than silver I br\u2014\n\u201cwhat?\u201d Even though I was expecting the interruption, the ice in her voice startled me into a jangle of notes and sent several butterflies into flight. I took a breath, assumed my most innocent expression, and looked up.\nHer expression was a storm of rage and disbelief. \u201cnice?\u201d I felt the blood drain from my face at her tone. Her voice was still round and gentle as a", "distant flute. But that meant nothing. Distant thunder doesn\u2019t drub the ears, you feel it prowling through your chest. The quiet of her voice moved through me in that distant-thunder way. \u201cnice?\u201d\n\u201cIt was nice,\u201d I said to mollify her, my air of innocence only half affected.\nShe opened her mouth as if she would speak, then closed her mouth. Her eyes flashed pure fury.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cI should have known better than to try.\u201d I pitched my voice somewhere between broken spirit and beaten child. I lowered my hands from the lute strings.\nSome of the fire left her, but when she found her voice it was tight and dangerous. \u201cmy skills \u2018suffice\u2019?\u201d She hardly seemed able to force out the last word. Her mouth formed a thin, outraged line.\nI exploded, my voice a roll of thunder. \u201cHow the hell am I supposed to know? It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve ever done this sort of thing before!\u201d\nShe reeled back at the vehemence of my words, some of the anger draining out of her. \u201cwhat is it you mean?\u201d she trailed off, confused.\n\u201cThis!\u201d I gestured awkwardly at myself, at her, at the cushions and the pavilion around us, as if that explained everything.\nThe last of the anger left her as I saw realization begin to dawn, \u201cyou ...\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I looked down, my face growing hot. \u201cI have never been with a woman.\u201d Then I straightened and looked her in the eye as if challenging her to make an issue out of it.\nFelurian was still for a moment, then her mouth turned up into a wry smile. \u201cyou tell me a faerie story, my kvothe.\u201d\nI felt my face go grim. I don\u2019t mind being called a liar. I am. I am a marvelous liar. But I hate being called a liar when I\u2019m telling the perfect truth.\nRegardless of its motivation, my expression seemed to convince her. \u201cbut you were like a gentle summer storm.\u201d She made a fluttering gesture with a hand. \u201cyou were a dancer fresh upon the field.\u201d Her eyes glittered wickedly.\nI tucked that comment away for later ego-polishing purposes. My reply was slightly wounded, \u201cPlease, I\u2019m not a complete rube. I\u2019ve read several books\u2014\u201d\nFelurian giggled like a brook. \u201cyou learned from books.\u201d She looked at me as if she couldn\u2019t decide whether or not to take me seriously. She laughed, stopped, then laughed again. I didn\u2019t know if I should be offended.\n\u201cYou were rather good too,\u201d I said hurriedly, knowing I sounded like the", "last dinner guest to compliment her on a salad. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I\u2019ve read \u2014\u201d\n\u201cbooks? books! you compare me with books!\u201d Her anger crashed over me. Then without even pausing for breath, Felurian laughed again, high and delighted. Her laugh was wild as a fox\u2019s cry, clear and sharp as morning birdsong. It was no human sound.\nI put on my innocent face. \u201cIsn\u2019t it always like this?\u201d I kept my expression calm while inwardly I braced myself for another outburst.\nShe simply sat. \u201cI am Felurian.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t a simple stating of a name. It was a declaration. It was a proud flag flying.\nI held her eyes for a moment, then sighed and dropped my gaze to my lute. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the song. I didn\u2019t mean to offend you.\u201d\n\u201cit was more lovely than the setting sun,\u201d she protested, sounding close to tears. \u201cbut.... nice?\u201d The word seemed bitter to her.\nI set my lute back into its case. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t fix it without some basis for comparison....\u201d I sighed. \u201cPity, it was a good song. They would have sung it for a thousand years.\u201d My voice was thick with regret.\nFelurian\u2019s expression brightened as if with an idea, then her eyes narrowed into slits. She looked at me as if she was trying to read something written on the inside of my skull.\nShe knew. She knew I was holding the unfinished song as ransom. The unspoken messages were clear: Unless I leave I can never finish the song. Unless I leave no one will ever hear these beautiful words I have made for you. Unless I leave and taste the fruits mortal women have to offer, I\u2019ll never know how skilled you truly are.\nThere, amid the cushions, under the eternal twilight sky, Felurian and I stared at each other. She held a butterfly, and my hand rested on the smooth wood of my lute. Two armored knights eyeing each other across a bloody field could not have matched the intensity of our stare.\nFelurian spoke slowly, gauging my response. \u201cif you go, will you finish it?\u201d I tried to look surprised, but I wasn\u2019t fooling her. I nodded. \u201cwill you come back to me and sing it?\u201d\nMy surprise became genuine. I hadn\u2019t considered her asking for that. I knew there would be no leaving the second time. I hesitated, but only for a barest moment. Half a loaf is better than none. I nodded.\n\u201cpromise?\u201d I nodded again. \u201cpromise with kisses?\u201d She closed her eyes", "and tilted her head back, like a flower basking in the sun.\nLife is too short to refuse offers like that. I moved toward her, drew her naked body toward my own, and kissed her as well as my limited practice\nwould allow. It seemed to be good enough.\nAs I pulled away she looked up at me and sighed. \u201cyour kisses are like\nsnowflakes on my lips.\u201d She lay back on the cushions, head resting on her arm. Her free hand brushed my cheek.\nTo say she was lovely is such an understatement I cannot begin to repair it. I realized that over the last several minutes she hadn\u2019t been trying to make me desire her, at least not in any supernatural sense.\nShe brushed her lips lightly over the palm of my hand and released it. Then she lay still, watching me intently.\nI was flattered. To this day I know of only one answer to a question so politely phrased. I bent to kiss her. And laughing, she took me in her arms.", ""], "CHAPTER NINETY-NINE": ["CHAPTER NINETY-NINE\nMagic of a Different Kind\nBY THIS POINT IN my life, I\u2019d earned myself a modest reputation. No, that\u2019s not entirely true. It\u2019s better to say that I had built myself a\nreputation. I\u2019d crafted it deliberately. I\u2019d cultivated it.\nThree-quarters of the stories folk told about me at the University were\nridiculous rumors I\u2019d started myself. I spoke eight languages. I could see in the dark. When I was three days old, my mother hung me in a basket from a rowan tree by the light of the full moon. That night a faerie laid a powerful charm on me to always keep me safe. It turned my eyes from blue to leafy green.\nI knew how stories worked, you see. Nobody believed that I\u2019d traded a cupped handful of my own fresh blood to a demon in exchange for an Alar like a blade of Ramston steel. But still, I was the highest ranked duelist in Dal\u2019s class. On a good day, I could beat any two of them together.\nThat thread of truth wove through the story, gave it strength. So even though you might not believe it, you might tell it to a wide-eyed first term student with a drink in him, just to watch his face, just for fun. And if you\u2019d had a drink or three yourself, you might begin to wonder....\nAnd so the stories spread. And so, around the University at least, my tiny reputation grew.\nThere were a few true stories as well. Pieces of my reputation I\u2019d honestly earned. I had rescued Fela from a blazing inferno. I had been whipped in front of a crowd and refused to bleed. I\u2019d called the wind and broken Ambrose\u2019s arm....\nStill, I knew my reputation was a coat spun out of cobweb. It was storybook nonsense. There were no demons out there, bargaining for blood. There were no helpful faeries granting magic charms. And though I might pretend, I knew I was no Taborlin the Great.\nThese were my thoughts when I woke, tangled in Felurian\u2019s arms. I lay quietly among the cushions for a time, her head resting lightly on my chest,", "her leg thrown loosely over mine. Looking up through the trees at the twilight sky, I realized I could not recognize the stars. They were brighter than those in the mortal sky, their patterns unfamiliar.\nIt was only then that I realized my life had taken a step in a new direction. Up until now, I had been playing at being a young Taborlin. I had spun lies around myself, pretending to be a storybook hero.\nBut now there was no sense pretending. What I\u2019d done was truly worth a story, every bit as odd and wonderful as any tale of Taborlin himself. I\u2019d followed Felurian into the Fae, then bested her with magics I couldn\u2019t explain, let alone control.\nI felt different now. More solid somehow. Not older, exactly. Not wiser. But I knew things that I\u2019d never known before. I knew the Fae were real. I knew their magic was real. Felurian could break a man\u2019s mind with a kiss. Her voice could tug me like a puppet by its strings. There were things I could learn here. Strange things. Powerful things. Secret things. Things I might never ever have a chance to learn again.\nI gently freed myself from Felurian\u2019s sleeping embrace and walked down to the nearby pool. I splashed water on my face and scooped up several handfuls to drink.\nI looked through the plants that grew at the water\u2019s edge. I picked some leaves and chewed them as I considered how I might approach the subject with Felurian. The mint sweetened my breath.\nWhen I returned to the pavilion, Felurian was standing there, brushing pale fingers through her long dark hair.\nI handed her a violet, its color dark as her eyes. She smiled at me and ate it.\nI decided to approach the subject gently, lest I offend her. \u201cI was wondering,\u201d I said carefully, \u201cif you would be willing to teach me.\u201d\nShe reached out to touch the side of my face gently. \u201cfoolish sweet,\u201d she said fondly. \u201chave not I already begun?\u201d\nI felt excitement rise in my chest, amazed that it could be so simple. \u201cAm I ready for my next lesson?\u201d I asked.\nHer smile grew wider and she looked me up and down, her eyes going half-lidded and mysterious. \u201care you?\u201d\nI nodded.\n\u201cit is good you are eager,\u201d Felurian said, her fluting voice tinged with amusement. \u201cyou have some cleverness and natural skill. but there is much to learn.\u201d She looked into my eyes, her delicate face gravely serious. \u201cwhen you", "leave to walk among the mortal, I will not have you shame me.\u201d\nFelurian took my hand and drew me into the pavilion. She pointed. \u201csit.\u201d I sat on a cushion, placing my head level with the smooth expanse of her\nstomach. Her navel was terribly distracting.\nShe looked down at me, her expression proud and regal as a queen.\n\u201camouen,\u201d she said, spreading the fingers of one hand and making a deliberate gesture. \u201cthis we call the hushed hart. an easy lesson to begin, and one I expect you will enjoy.\u201d\nFelurian smiled at me then, her eyes old and knowing. And even before she pushed me back against the cushions and began to bite the side of my neck, I realized that she did not intend to teach me magic. Or if she did, it was magic of a different kind.\nWhile it was not the subject I\u2019d hoped to study under her, it\u2019s fair to say that I was not entirely disappointed. Learning lover\u2019s arts from Felurian far outstripped any curriculum offered at the University.\nI am not referring to the vigorous sweaty wrestling most men\u2014and alas, most women\u2014think of as love. While sweat and vigor are pleasant parts of it, Felurian brought to my attention the subtler pieces. If I were to go into the world, she said, I would not embarrass her by being an incompetent lover, and so she took care to show me a great many things.\nA few of them in her words: The pinioned wrist. The sigh toward the ear. Devouring the neck. Drawing the lips. The kissing of the throat, the navel, and\u2014as Felurian phrased it\u2014the woman\u2019s flower. The breathing kiss. The feather kiss. The climbing kiss. So many different types of kissing. Too many to remember. Almost.\nThere was drawing water from the well. The fluttering hand. Birdsong at morning. Circling the moon. Playing ivy. The harrowed hare. Just the names would fill a book. But this, I suppose, is not the place for such things. Alas then for the world.\nI don\u2019t mean to give the impression that all our hours were spent in dalliance. I was young and Felurian was immortal, but there is only so much two bodies can endure. The rest of the time we amused ourselves in other ways. We swam and ate. I played songs for Felurian, and she danced for me.\n \nI asked Felurian a few careful questions about magic, not wanting to offend her by prying at her secrets. Unfortunately, her answers were not particularly enlightening. Her magic came as naturally as breathing. I might as well have asked a farmer how seeds sprouted. When her answers weren\u2019t hopelessly nonchalant, they were puzzlingly cryptic.\nStill, I continued to ask, and she answered as best she could. And occasionally I felt a small spark of understanding.\nBut most of our time was spent telling stories. We had so little in common that stories were all that we could share.\nYou might think Felurian and I would be unevenly matched in this regard. She was older than the sky, while I was not yet seventeen.\nBut Felurian was not the narrative treasure trove you would think. Powerful and clever? Certainly. Energetic and lovely? Absolutely. But storytelling was not among her many gifts.\nI, on the other hand, was of the Edema Ruh, and we know all the stories in the world.\nSo I told her \u201cThe Ghost and the Goosegirl.\u201d I told her \u201cTam and the Tinker\u2019s Spade.\u201d I told her stories of woodcutters and widow\u2019s daughters and the cleverness of orphan boys.\nIn exchange, Felurian told me manling stories: \u201cThe Hand at the Heart of the Pearl,\u201d \u201cThe Boy Who Ran Between.\u201d The Fae have their own cast of legendary characters: Mavin the Manshaped, Alavin Allface. Surprisingly, Felurian had never heard of Taborlin the Great or Oren Velciter, but she did know who Illien was. It made me proud that one of the Edema Ruh had gained a place in the stories the Fae tell each other.\nI wasn\u2019t blind to the fact that Felurian herself might have the information I was looking for about the Amyr and the Chandrian. How much more enjoyable would it be to learn the truth from her, rather than rooting endlessly through ancient books in dusty rooms?\nUnfortunately, Felurian wasn\u2019t the mine of information I\u2019d hoped. She knew stories of the Amyr, but they were thousands of years old.\nWhen I asked her about the more recent Amyr, asking about church knights and the Ciridae with their bloody tattoos, she merely laughed. \u201cthere were never any human amyr,\u201d she said, dismissing the idea out of hand. \u201cthose you speak of sound like children dressing in their parents\u2019 clothes.\u201d\nWhile I might expect that reaction from others, getting it from Felurian was particularly disheartening. Still, it was nice to know I had been right", "about the Amyr existing long before they became knights of the Tehlin church.\nThen, since the Amyr were a lost cause, I tried to steer her in the direction of the Chandrian.\n\u201cno,\u201d she said, looking me squarely in the eye, her back straight. \u201cI will not speak of the seven.\u201d Her soft voice held no lilting whimsy. No playfulness. No room for discussion or negotiation.\nFor the first time since our initial conflict, I felt a trickle of icy fear sweep over me. She was so slight and lovely, it was so easy to forget what she truly was.\nStill, I couldn\u2019t let the subject go so easily. This was, quite literally, a once in a lifetime opportunity. If Felurian could be persuaded to tell me even a piece of what she knew, I could learn things no one else in the world might know.\nI gave her my most charming smile and drew a breath to speak, but before I could get the first word out, Felurian leaned forward and kissed me full upon the mouth. Her lips were plush and warm. Her tongue brushed mine and she bit the swell of my lower lip playfully.\nWhen she pulled her mouth from mine, it left me breathless with a racing heart. She looked at me, her dark eyes full of tender sweetness. She laid her hand along my face, brushing my cheek as gently as a flower.\n\u201cmy sweet love,\u201d she said. \u201cif you ask of the seven again in this place, I will drive you from it. no matter if your asking be firm or gentle, honest or slantways. if you ask, I will whip you forth from here with a lash of brambles and snakes. I will drive you before me, bloody and weeping, and will not stop until you are dead or fled from fae.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t look away from me as she spoke. And though I hadn\u2019t looked away or seen them change, her eyes were no longer soft with adoration. They were dark as storm clouds, hard as ice.\n\u201cI do not jest,\u201d she said. \u201cI swear this by my flower and the ever-moving moon. I swear it by salt and stone and sky. I swear this singing and laughing, by the sound of my own name.\u201d She kissed me again, pressing her lips to mine tenderly. \u201cI will do this thing.\u201d\nAnd that was the end of it. I might be a fool, but I am not that much of a fool.\n \nFelurian was more than willing to talk about the Fae realm itself. And many of her stories detailed the fractious politics of the faen courts: the Tain Mael, the Daendan, the Gorse Court. These stories were difficult for me to follow as I didn\u2019t know anything about the factions involved, let alone the web of alliances, false friendships, open secrets, and old grudges that bound Fae society together.\nThis was complicated by the fact that Felurian took it for granted that I understood certain things. If I were telling you a story, for example, I wouldn\u2019t bother mentioning that most moneylenders are Cealdish, or that there is no royalty older than the Modegan royal line. Who doesn\u2019t know such things?\nFelurian left similar details out of her stories. Who wouldn\u2019t know, for example, that the Gorse Court had meddled in the Berentaltha between the Mael and the House of Fine?\nAnd why was this important? Well of course that would lead to members of the Gorse being scorned by those on the dayward side of things. And what was the Berentaltha? A sort of dance. And why was this dance important?\nAfter a handful of questions such as this, Felurian\u2019s eyes would narrow. I quickly learned it was better to follow along, quiet and confused, rather than try to winkle out every detail and risk her irritation.\nStill, I learned things from these stories: a thousand small, scattered facts about the Fae. The names of the courts, old battles, and notable persons. I learned you must never look at one of the Thiana with both eyes at once, and that the gift of a single cinnas fruit is considered a terrible insult if given to one of the Beladari.\nYou might think these thousand facts gave me some insight into the Fae. That I somehow fit them together like puzzle pieces and discovered the true shape of things. A thousand facts is quite a lot, after all....\nBut no. A thousand seems like a lot, but there are more stars than that in the sky, and they make neither a map nor a mural. All I knew for certain after hearing Felurian\u2019s stories is that I had no desire to ever entangle myself in even the kindest corner of the faen court. With my luck I\u2019d whistle while walking under a willow and thereby insult God\u2019s barber, or something of the sort.\nHere is the one thing I learned from these stories: the Fae are not like us.", "This is endlessly easy to forget, because many of them look as we do. They speak our language. They have two eyes. They have hands, and their mouths make familiar shapes when they smile. But these things are only seemings. We are not the same.\nI have heard people say that men and the Fae are as different as dogs and wolves. While this is an easy analogy, it is far from true. Wolves and dogs are only separated by a minor shade of blood. Both howl at night. If beaten, both will bite.\nNo. Our people and theirs are as different as water and alcohol. In equal glasses they look the same. Both liquid. Both clear. Both wet, after a fashion. But one will burn, the other will not. This has nothing to do with temperament or timing. These two things behave differently because they are profoundly, fundamentally not the same.\nThe same is true with humans and the Fae. We forget it at our peril.", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED\nShaed\nI SHOULD, PERHAPS, EXPLAIN a few peculiarities of the Fae.\nAt first glance, Felurian\u2019s forest glade did not seem particularly odd. In\nmost ways it resembled an ancient, untouched piece of forest. If not for the unfamiliar stars above, I might have suspected I was still in an isolated piece of the Eld.\nBut there were differences. Since I had left my mercenary companions I had slept perhaps a dozen times. Despite this, the sky above Felurian\u2019s pavilion remained the deep purpling blue of summer dusk and showed no signs of changing.\nI had only the roughest guess as to how long I had been in the Fae. More importantly, I had no idea how much time might have been passing in the mortal world. Stories are full of boys who fall asleep in faerie circles only to wake as old men. Young girls wander into the woods and return years later, looking no older and claiming only minutes have passed.\nFor all I knew, years could pass each time I slept in Felurian\u2019s arms. I could return to find a century had passed, or no time at all.\nI did my best not to think about it. Only a fool worries over what he can\u2019t control.\nThe other difference in the Fae realm was much more subtle and difficult to describe....\nIn the Medica, I had spent a fair amount of time around unconscious patients. I mention this to make a point: there is a great difference between being in a room that is empty and being in a room where someone is sleeping. A sleeping person is a presence in a room. They are aware of you, even if it is only a dim, vague awareness.\nThat is what the Fae was like. It was such an odd, intangible thing that I didn\u2019t notice it for a long while. Then, once I became aware of it, it took me much longer to lay my finger on what the difference was.\nIt felt as if I had moved from an empty room into a room where someone", "was asleep. Except, of course, that there was no one there. It was as if everything around me was deeply asleep: the trees, the stones, the rippling stream that widened into Felurian\u2019s pool. All these things felt more solid, more present than I was used to, as if they were ever so slightly aware of me.\nThe thought that I would eventually leave the Fae alive and unbroken was an unfamiliar one for Felurian, and I could tell it troubled her. Often, while in the midst of an unrelated conversation, she would change direction and make me promise, promise, to return to her.\nI reassured her as best I could, but there are only so many ways you can say the same thing. After perhaps three dozen times I said, \u201cI will do my best to keep myself safe so I can come back to you.\u201d\nI saw her face change, becoming first anxious, then grim, then thoughtful. For a moment I worried she had decided to keep me as a pet mortal after all, and I began to berate myself for not fleeing the Fae when I had the chance....\nBut before I could begin to grow genuinely concerned, Felurian cocked her head to one side and seemed to change the subject, \u201cwould my sweet flame like a coat? a cloak?\u201d\n\u201cI have one,\u201d I said, gesturing to where my possessions lay scattered at the edge of the pavilion. Only then did I notice that the tatty old tinker\u2019s cloak wasn\u2019t there. I saw my clothes, my boots, and my travelsack still bulging with the Maer\u2019s lockbox. But my cloak and sword were gone. The fact that I hadn\u2019t noticed their absence was understandable, as I hadn\u2019t bothered dressing since I first woke next to Felurian.\nShe looked me over slowly, her expression intent. Her eyes lingering on my knee, my lower arm, my upper arm. It was only when she took hold of my shoulder, and turned me so she could examine my back, that I realized she was looking at my scars.\nFelurian took hold of my hand and traced a pale line that ran along my forearm. \u201cyou are not good at keeping yourself safe, my kvothe.\u201d\nI was a little offended, especially as there was more than a little truth to what she said. \u201cI do fairly well,\u201d I said stiffly. \u201cConsidering the trouble that I find.\u201d\nFelurian turned over my hand and examined my palm and fingers closely.\n \n\u201cyou are not a fighter,\u201d she mused softly to herself. \u201cyet you are all iron- bitten. you are a sweet bird that cannot fly. no bow. no knife. no chain.\u201d\nHer hand moved to my foot, running thoughtfully along the calluses and scars from my years on the streets of Tarbean. \u201cyou are a long walker. you find me in the wild at night. you are a deep knower. and bold. and young. and trouble finds you.\u201d\nShe looked up at me, her face intent. \u201cwould my sweet poet like a shaed?\u201d \u201cA what?\u201d\nShe paused as if considering her words. \u201ca shadow.\u201d\nI smiled. \u201cI already have one.\u201d Then I checked to make sure. I was in the\nFae after all.\nFelurian frowned, shaking her head at my lack of understanding. \u201canother I\nwould give a shield, and it would keep him safe from harm. another I would gift with amber, bind a scabbard tight with glamour, or craft a crown so men might look on you with love.\u201d\nShe shook her head solemnly. \u201cbut not for you. you are a night walker. a moon follower. you must be safe from iron, from cold, from spite. you must be quiet. you must be light. you must move softly in the night. you must be quick and unafraid.\u201d She nodded to herself. \u201cthis means I must make you a shaed.\u201d\nShe stood and started walking toward the forest. \u201ccome,\u201d she said.\nFelurian had a way of making requests that took some getting used to. I\u2019d discovered that unless I was steeling myself to resist, I\u2019d find myself automatically doing whatever it was she asked of me.\nIt wasn\u2019t that she spoke with authority. Her voice was too soft and edgeless to carry the weight of command. She did not demand or cajole. When she spoke, it was matter-of-fact. As if she couldn\u2019t imagine a world in which you didn\u2019t want to do exactly as she said.\nBecause of this, when Felurian told me to follow her, I jumped like a puppet with its strings pulled. Soon I was padding along beside her, deep in the twilight shadows of the ancient forest, naked as a jaybird.\nI almost went back to grab my clothes, then decided to follow some advice my father had given me when I was young. \u201cEveryone eats a different part of the pig,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cYou want to fit in, you\u2019ll do the same.\u201d Different places, different decorums.\nSo I followed, naked and unprepared. Felurian struck out at a good pace, the moss muffling the sound of our bare feet.", "As we walked the forest grew darker. At first I thought it was simply the branches of the trees arching over our heads. Then I realized the truth. Above us, the twilight sky was slowly growing darker. Eventually, the last hint of purple was gone, leaving the sky a perfect velvet black, flecked with unfamiliar stars.\nFelurian kept walking, I could see her pale skin in the starlight and the shapes of trees around us, but nothing more. Thinking myself clever, I made a sympathetic binding for light and held my hand above my head as if it were a torch. I was more than slightly proud of this, as the motion-to-light binding is rather difficult without a piece of metal to use as a focus.\nLight swelled and I caught a moment\u2019s glimpse of our surroundings. Dark trunks of trees rose like massive pillars as far as the eye could see. There were no low-hanging branches, no undergrowth, no grass. Only dark moss underfoot and the arch of dark branches overhead. I was reminded of a vast, empty cathedral swathed in sooty velvet.\n\u201cciar nalias!\u201d Felurian snapped.\nUnderstanding her tone if not her words, I broke the binding and let the darkness rush back over us. An instant later Felurian leapt at me and bore me to the ground, her lithe, naked body pressed against mine. It was not an entirely uncommon occurrence, but this time the experience was not particularly erotic as the back of my head struck a knuckle of protruding root.\nBecause of this I was half dazed and nine-tenths blind when the earth shuddered slightly beneath us. Something vast and almost perfectly silent stirred the air above us and slightly off to one side of where we lay.\nPoised atop me, one leg on either side, Felurian\u2019s body was as taut as a harp string. The muscles of her thighs were tense and quivering. Her long hair fell over us, covering us like a silk sheet. Her breasts pressed against my chest as she drew a shallow, silent breath.\nHer body thrummed with the rhythm of her racing heart, and I felt her mouth move where it rested near the hollow of my throat. Softer than a whisper, Felurian spoke a gentle, edgeless word. I felt it press against my skin, sending silent ripples through the air the same way a thrown stone makes circles on the surface of a pond.\nThere was a soft sound of movement above us, as if someone was folding a huge piece of velvet around a piece of broken glass. Saying that I realize it makes no sense, but still, that is the best way I can describe the sound. It was a soft noise, the half-heard sound of deliberate movement. I cannot tell you", "why it made me think of something terrible and sharp, but it did. My forehead prickled with sweat, and I was filled with a sudden pure and breathless terror.\nFelurian went perfectly still, as if she were a startled deer or a cat about to pounce. Quietly, she drew a breath, then spoke a second word. Her breath brushed hot against my throat, and at the half-heard word my body thrummed as if I were a drumhead soundly struck.\nFelurian turned her head a bare degree, as if straining to listen. This movement pulled a thousand strands of her splayed hair slowly over the entire left half of my naked body, covering me in gooseflesh. Even in the grip of my nameless terror, I shivered and gave a soft, involuntary gasp.\nThere was a stirring in the air directly above us.\nThe sharp nails of Felurian\u2019s left hand dug hard into the muscle of my shoulder. She shifted her hips, and slowly slid her naked body up along my own until her face was even with mine. Her tongue flicked against my lips, and without even thinking I tilted my head, reaching for the kiss.\nHer mouth met mine, and she drew a long slow breath, pulling the air out of me. I felt my head grow light. Then, her lips still tight against mine, Felurian pushed her breath hard into me, filling my lungs. It was softer than silent. It tasted of honeysuckle. The ground shivered beneath me and everything was still. For an endless moment my heart ceased beating in my chest.\nA subtle tension left the air above us.\nFelurian pulled her mouth from mine and my heart thumped again, sudden and hard. A second beat. A third. I pulled in a deep, shaking breath.\nOnly then did Felurian relax. She lay atop me, loose and supple, her naked body flowing over mine like water. Her head nestled into the curve of my neck and she gave a sweet, contented sigh.\nA languid moment passed, then she laughed, her body shaking with it. It was wild and delighted, as if she had just played the most marvelous joke. She sat up and kissed my mouth fiercely, then nipped at my ear before climbing off me and pulling me to my feet.\nI opened my mouth. Then closed it, deciding this was probably not the right time for questions. Half of seeming clever is keeping your mouth shut at the right times.\nSo we continued in darkness. Eventually my eyes adjusted, and through the branches above I could see the stars, differently patterned and brighter than", "those in the mortal sky. Their light was barely enough to give an impression of the ground and surrounding trees. Felurian\u2019s slender form was a silver shadow in the darkness.\nWe kept walking, and the trees grew taller and thicker, blocking out the pale starlight bit by bit. Then it became truly dark. Felurian was little more than a piece of pale darkness ahead of me. She stopped walking before I lost sight of her entirely and cupped her hands around her mouth as if she were about to shout.\nI cringed at the thought of a loud noise invading the warm quiet of this place. But instead of a shout there was nothing. No. Not nothing. It was like a low, slow purr. Not anything so loud and rough as a cat\u2019s purr. It was closer to the sound a heavy snowfall makes, a muffled hush that almost makes less noise than no noise at all.\nFelurian did this several times. Then she took me by the hand and led me farther into the dark where she repeated the odd, almost inaudible noise. After she had done this three times it was so dark I could no longer see even the faintest shape of her.\nAfter the final pause, Felurian stepped close to me in the dark, pressing her body to mine. She gave me a long and thorough kiss that I expected to become something more involved when she pulled away and spoke softly into my ear. \u201cquietly,\u201d she breathed. \u201cthey come.\u201d\nFor several minutes I strained my eyes and ears to no avail. Then I saw something luminous in the distance. It disappeared quickly, and I thought my light-starved eyes were playing tricks on me. Then I saw another flicker. Two more. Ten. A hundred pale lights danced toward us through the trees, faint as foxfire.\nI\u2019d heard of fool\u2019s fire before, but never seen it. And given that we were in the Fae, I doubted this was anything so mundane. I thought of a hundred faerie stories and wondered which of those creatures could be responsible for these dim, madly dancing lights. Tom-Sparks? Will o\u2019 wisps? Dennerlings with lanterns full of corpselight?\nThen they were all around us, startling me. The lights were smaller than I\u2019d thought, and closer. I heard the hushed snowfall sound again, this time from all around me. I still couldn\u2019t guess what they might be until one of them brushed my arm as lightly as a feather. They were moths of some sort. Moths with luminescent patches on their wings.\nThey shone with a pale, silvery light too weak to illuminate anything", "around them. But hundreds of them, dancing between the boles of trees, showed the silhouette of our surroundings. Some of them lit on trees or the ground. A few landed on Felurian, and though I still could not see more than a few inches of her pale skin, I could use the moving light of them to follow her.\nWe walked a long while after that, Felurian leading between the trunks of ancient trees. Once I felt grass soft beneath my bare feet instead of moss, then there was soft soil, as if we were crossing a farmer\u2019s fresh-tilled field. For a time we followed a twisting path of smooth paved stone that led us over the arch of a high bridge. All the while the moths followed us, giving me only the dimmest impression of our surroundings.\nEventually Felurian stopped. By now the darkness was so thick I could almost feel it like a warm blanket around me. I could tell by the sound of the wind in the trees and the motion of the moths that we were standing in an open space.\nThere were no stars above us. If we were in a clearing, the trees must be vast for their branches to meet overhead. But for all I knew we could just as easily be deep underground. Or perhaps the sky was black and empty in this portion of the Fae. It was a strangely unsettling thought.\nThe subtle feeling of sleeping alertness was stronger here. If the rest of the Fae felt like it was sleeping, this place felt like it had stirred half a moment ago and hovered on the verge of waking. It was disconcerting.\nFelurian gently pressed the flat of her hand against my chest, then a finger against my lips. I watched as she moved away from me, softly humming a little snatch of the song I had made for her. But even this piece of flattery couldn\u2019t distract me from the fact that I was in the center of the Fae realm, blind, stark naked, and without the slightest idea of what was going on.\nA handful of moths had landed on Felurian, resting on her wrist, hip, shoulder and thigh. Watching them gave me a vague impression of her movements. If I had to guess, I would have said she was picking things out of the trees, from behind or beneath bushes or stones. A warm breeze sighed through the clearing, and I felt strangely comforted as it brushed my bare skin.\nAfter about ten minutes, Felurian came back and kissed me. She held something soft and warm in her arms.\nWe walked back the way we had come. The moths gradually lost interest in us, leaving us with less and less of an impression of our surroundings.", "After what seemed an interminable amount of time I saw light filtering through a break in the trees ahead. It was only faint starlight, but at that moment it seemed bright as a curtain of burning diamonds.\nI started to walk through it, but Felurian took hold of my arm to stop me. Without a word she sat me down where the first faint beams of starlight lanced through the trees to touch the ground.\nCarefully she stepped between the rays of starlight, avoiding them as if they might burn her. When she stood in the center of them, she lowered herself to the ground and sat cross-legged, facing me. She held whatever she had collected in her lap, but other than the fact that it was shapeless and dark I could tell nothing about it.\nThen Felurian reached out a hand, took hold of one of the thin beams of starlight, and pulled it toward the dark shape in her lap.\nI might have been more surprised if Felurian\u2019s manner hadn\u2019t been so casual. In the dim light, I saw her hands make a familiar motion. A second later she reached out again, almost absentmindedly, and grasped another narrow strand of starlight between her thumb and forefinger.\nShe drew it in as easily as the first and manipulated it in the same way. Again the motion struck me as familiar, but it was nothing I could press my finger to.\nFelurian started to hum quietly to herself as she gathered in the next beam of starlight, brightening things an imperceptible amount. The shape in her lap looked like thick, dark cloth. Seeing this I realized what she reminded me of: my father sewing. Was she sewing by starlight?\nSewing with starlight. Realization came to me in a flood. Shaed meant shadow. She had somehow brought back an armful of shadow and was sewing it with starlight. Sewing me a cloak of shadow.\nSound absurd? It did to me. But regardless of my ignorant opinion, Felurian took hold of another strand of starlight and brought it to her lap. I brushed any doubt aside. Only a fool disbelieves what he sees with his own eyes.\nBesides, the stars above me were bright and strange. I was sitting next to a creature out of a storybook. She had been young and beautiful for a thousand years. She could stop my heart with a kiss and talk to butterflies. Was I going to start quibbling now?\nAfter a while I moved closer so I could watch more carefully. She smiled as I sat next to her, favoring me with a hasty kiss.", "I asked a couple questions, but her answers either made no sense or were hopelessly nonchalant. She didn\u2019t know the first thing about the laws of sympathy, or sygaldry, or the Alar. She simply didn\u2019t think there was anything odd about sitting in the forest holding a handful of shadow. First I was offended, then I was terribly jealous.\nI remembered when I\u2019d found the name of the wind in her pavilion. It had felt as if I were truly awake for the first time, true knowledge running like ice in my blood.\nThe memory exhilarated me for a moment, then left me with a broken chord of loss. My sleeping mind was slumbering again. I turned my attention back to Felurian and tried to understand.\nBefore too long, Felurian stood in a fluid motion and helped me to my feet. She hummed happily and took my arm as we strolled back the way we had come, chatting of little things. She held the dark shape of the shaed draped easily over her arm.\nThen, just as the first faint hint of twilight began to touch the sky, she hung it invisibly in the dark branches of a nearby tree. \u201csometimes slow seduction is the only way,\u201d she said. \u201cthe gentle shadow fears the candleflame. how could your fledgling shaed not feel the same?\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED ONE": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED ONE\nClose Enough to Touch\nAFTER OUR SHADOW-GATHERING EXPEDITION, I asked more pointed questions about Felurian\u2019s magic. Most of her answers continued to be hopelessly matter-of-fact. How do you take hold of a shadow? She motioned with one hand, as if reaching for a piece of fruit. That was how, apparently.\nOther answers were nearly incomprehensible, filled with Fae words I didn\u2019t understand. When she tried to describe those terms, our conversations became hopeless rhetorical tangles. At times I felt like I\u2019d found myself a quieter, more attractive version of Elodin.\nStill, I learned a few scraps. What she was doing with the shadow was called grammarie. When I asked, she said it was \u201cthe art of making things be.\u201d This was distinct from glamourie, which was \u201cthe art of making things seem.\u201d\nI also learned that there aren\u2019t directions of the usual sort in the Fae. Your trifoil compass is useless as a tin codpiece there. North does not exist. And when the sky is endless twilight, you cannot watch the sun rise in the east.\nBut if you look closely at the sky, one piece of the horizon will be a shade brighter, in the opposite direction a shade darker. If you walk toward the brighter horizon, eventually it will become daytime. The other way leads to darker night. If you keep walking in one direction long enough, you will eventually see a whole \u201cday\u201d pass and end up in the same place you began. That\u2019s the theory, at any rate.\nFelurian described those two points of the Fae compass as Day and Night. The other two points she referred to at different times as Dark and Light, Summer and Winter, or Forward and Backward. Once she even referred to them as Grimward and Grinning, but something about the way she said it made me suspect it was a joke.\n \nI have a good memory. That, perhaps more than anything else, sits in the center of what I am. It is the talent upon which so many of my other skills depend.\nI can only guess how I came by my memory. My early stage training, perhaps. The games my parents used to help me remember my lines. Perhaps it was the mental exercises Abenthy taught me to prepare me for the University.\nWherever it came from, my memory has always served me well. Sometimes it works much better than I\u2019d like.\nThat said, my memory is strangely patchy when I think of my time in the Fae. My conversations with Felurian are clear as glass. Her lessons may as well be written on my skin. The sight of her. The taste of her mouth. They are all fresh as yesterday.\nBut other things I cannot bring to mind at all.\nFor example, I remember Felurian in the purpling twilight. It dappled her through the trees, making her look as if she were underwater. I remember her in flickering candlelight, the teasing shadows of it concealing more than it revealed. And I remember her in the full, rich amber of lamplight. She basked in it like a cat, her skin warm and glowing.\nBut I do not remember lamps. Or candles. There is a great deal of fuss when dealing with such things, but I cannot remember a single moment spent trimming a wick or wiping soot from the glass hood of a lamp. I do not remember the smell of oil or smoke or wax.\nI remember eating. Fruit and bread and honey. Felurian ate flowers. Fresh orchids. Wild trillium. Lush selas. I tried some myself. The violets were my favorite.\nI don\u2019t mean to imply she ate only flowers. She enjoyed bread and butter and honey. She liked blackberries especially. And there was meat, too. Not with every meal, but sometimes. Wild venison. Pheasant. Bear. Felurian ate hers so rare that it was almost raw.\nShe was not a fastidious eater, either. Not prim or courtly. We ate with our hands and teeth, and afterward, if we were sticky with honey or pulp or the blood of bears, we would wash ourselves in the nearby pool.\nI can see her even now, naked, laughing, blood running down her chin. She was regal as a queen. Eager as a child. Proud as a cat. And she was like none", "of those things. Nothing like them. Not in the least little bit.\nMy point is this: I can remember our eating. What I cannot remember is\nwhere the food came from. Did someone bring it? Did she gather it herself? I cannot bring it to mind to save my life. The thought of servants intruding on the privacy of her twilight glade seems impossible to me, but so is the thought of Felurian baking her own bread.\nThe deer, on the other hand, I could understand. I had not the least doubt she could run one to ground and kill it with her hands if she desired. Or I could picture a shy hart venturing into the quiet of her twilight glade. I can imagine Felurian sitting, patient and calm, waiting until it came close enough to touch....", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWO": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWO\nThe Ever-Moving Moon\nFELURIAN AND I WERE walking down to the pool when I noticed a subtle difference in the quality of light. Looking up, I was surprised to see the pale curve of the moon peering through the trees above us.\nEven though it was only the slenderest crescent, I recognized it as the same moon I had known my whole life. Seeing it in this strange place was like meeting a long-lost friend far from home.\n\u201cLook!\u201d I said, pointing. \u201cThe moon!\u201d\nFelurian smiled indulgently. \u201cyou are my precious newborn lamb. look! there hangs a cloud as well! amouen! dance for joy!\u201d She laughed.\nI flushed, embarrassed. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I haven\u2019t seen it in ...\u201d I trailed off, having no way to gauge my time. \u201cA long while. Besides, you have different stars. I thought perhaps you had a different moon as well.\u201d\nFelurian ran her fingers gently through my hair. \u201cfoolish sweet, there is only one moon. we have been waiting on her. she will help us enbighten your shaed.\u201d She slipped into the water, sleek as an otter. When she surfaced her hair slicked her shoulders like ink.\nI sat on a stone by the edge of a pool and dangled my feet. The water was warm as a bath. \u201cHow can the moon be here,\u201d I asked, \u201cif this is a different sky?\u201d\n\u201cthere is only one slender slip of her here,\u201d Felurian said. \u201cshe is still mostly in the mortal now.\u201d\n\u201cBut how?\u201d I asked.\nFelurian stopped swimming and floated on her back, looking up at the sky. \u201coh moon,\u201d she said forlornly. \u201cI perish for kisses. why have you brought me an owl when I desired a man?\u201d She sighed, then softly hooted into the night: how? how? how?\nI slid into the water, not as lithe as an otter perhaps, but somewhat better at kissing.\nA while later we lay in the shallows on a broad sheet of stone worn water-", "smooth. \u201cthank you moon,\u201d Felurian said, looking up at the sky contentedly. \u201cfor this sweet and lusty manling.\u201d\nThere were luminous fishes in the pool. No larger than your hand, each with a stripe or spot of gently glowing color. I watched them emerge from whatever hiding places they had scattered to, startled by the recent turbulence. They were orange as glowing coals, yellow as buttercups, blue as noontime sky.\nFelurian slid back into the water, then tugged at my leg. \u201ccome, my kissing owl,\u201d she said. \u201cand I will show to you the workings of the moon.\u201d\nI followed her into the pool until we stood shoulder deep. The fish came to explore, the braver ones coming close enough to swim between us. Their motion revealed the hidden silhouette of Felurian\u2019s body beneath the water. Despite the fact that I had explored her nakedness in great detail, I suddenly found myself fascinated by the suggested shape of her.\nThe fish came closer still. One brushed me, and I felt a gentle nip against my ribs. I jumped, though its tiny bite was soft as a tapping finger. I watched as more of the fish circled round, occasionally nibbling at us.\n\u201ceven the fish delight in kissing you,\u201d Felurian said, stepping closer to press her wet body against mine.\n\u201cI think they must like the salt on my skin,\u201d I said, looking down at them. She pushed me away, irritated. \u201cmayhap they like the taste of owl.\u201d Before I could make an appropriate reply, she assumed a serious\nexpression, flattened her hand, and lowered it into the water between us. \u201cthere is only one moon,\u201d Felurian said. \u201cshe moves between your mortal\nsky and mine.\u201d She pressed her palm against my chest, then brought it back and pressed it to her own. \u201cshe sways between. back and forth.\u201d She stopped, frowning at me. \u201cbe mindful of my words.\u201d\n\u201cI am,\u201d I lied.\n\u201cno. you are mindful of my breasts.\u201d\nIt was true. They flirted with the surface of the water. \u201cThey are well worth\nminding,\u201d I said. \u201cTo not attend to them would be a terrible insult.\u201d\n\u201cI speak of important things. knowings you must have if you are to return\nsafe to me.\u201d She gave an exasperated sigh. \u201cif I let you touch one, will you attend to my words?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nShe took hold of my hand and pulled it close to cup her breast. \u201cmake waves upon lilies.\u201d", "\u201cYou haven\u2019t shown me waves upon lilies yet.\u201d\n\u201cthat will come later, then.\u201d She put her flat hand back in the water between us, then sighed softly, her eyes going halfway closed. \u201cah,\u201d she said. \u201coh.\u201d\nEventually the fish emerged from their hiding places again.\n\u201cmy most distractible owl,\u201d Felurian said, not unkindly. She dove to the bottom of the pool and returned holding a smooth, round stone. \u201cattend you now to what I say. you are the mortal, I the fae.\u201d\n\u201chere is the moon,\u201d she said, tucking the stone between our palms and lacing our fingers together to hold it. \u201cshe\u2019s tethered tight to both the fae and mortal night.\u201d\nFelurian stepped forward and pressed the stone against my chest. \u201cthus moves the moon,\u201d she said, tightening her fingers around mine. \u201cnow when I look above, there is no glimmer of the light I love. instead, all like a flower unfurled, her face shines on your mortal world.\u201d\nShe stepped back so our arms were straight with our clasped hands between us. Then she pulled the stone toward her chest, dragging me through the water by my hand. \u201cnow all your mortal maidens sigh, for she is fully in my sky.\u201d\nI nodded, understanding. \u201cBeloved by both the Fae and men. Our moon\u2019s a merry wanderer then?\u201d\nFelurian shook her head. \u201cnot so. a traveler, yes. a wanderer, no. she moves but cannot freely go.\u201d\n\u201cI heard a story once,\u201d I said. \u201cAbout a man who stole the moon.\u201d\nFelurian\u2019s expression went solemn. She unlaced her fingers from mine and looked down at the stone in her hand. \u201cthat was the end of it all.\u201d She sighed. \u201cuntil he stole the moon there was some hope for peace.\u201d\nI was stunned by the matter-of-fact tone in her voice. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked dumbly.\n\u201cthe stealing of the moon.\u201d She cocked her head at me, puzzled. \u201cyou said you knew of it.\u201d\n\u201cI said I\u2019d heard a story,\u201d I said. \u201cBut it was a silly thing. Not a story of what truly was. It was a f ... It was the sort of story that you tell a child.\u201d\nShe smiled again. \u201cyou may call them faerie stories. I know of them. they are fancies. we tell our children manling tales betimes.\u201d\n\u201cBut the moon was truly stolen?\u201d I asked. \u201cThat was no fancy?\u201d Felurian scowled. \u201cthis I have been showing you!\u201d she said, bringing her", "hand down in an angry splash.\nI found myself making the Adem gesture for apology below the surface of\nthe water before realizing it was doubly pointless. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cBut without the truth of this story I am lost. I beg of you to tell me it.\u201d\n\u201cit is an old story, and a sad one.\u201d She gave me a long look. \u201cwhat then will you trade me?\u201d\n\u201cThe hushed hart,\u201d I said.\n\u201cin that you give a gift that is a gift to you,\u201d she said archly. \u201cwhat else?\u201d \u201cI will also make thousand hands,\u201d I said, watching her expression soften.\n\u201cAnd I will show you something new I have thought of all myself. I call it swaying against the wind.\u201d\nShe crossed her arms and looked away, making a great show of indifference. \u201cnew perhaps to you. I doubtless know it by a different name.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d I said. \u201cBut if you will not trade you cannot know.\u201d\n\u201cvery well,\u201d she conceded with a sigh. \u201cbut only because you are quite good at thousand hands.\u201d\nFelurian looked up at the slender moon for a moment, then said. \u201clong before the cities of man. before men. before fae. there were those who walked with their eyes open. they knew all the deep names of things.\u201d She paused and looked at me. \u201cdo you know what this means?\u201d\n\u201cWhen you know the name of a thing you have mastery over it,\u201d I said.\n\u201cno,\u201d she said, startling me with the weight of rebuke in her voice. \u201cmastery was not given. they had the deep knowing of things. not mastery. to swim is not mastery over the water. to eat an apple is not mastery of the apple.\u201d She gave me a sharp look. \u201cdo you understand?\u201d\nI didn\u2019t. But I nodded anyway, not wanting to upset her or sidetrack the story.\n\u201cthese old name-knowers moved smoothly through the world. they knew the fox and they knew the hare, and they knew the space between the two.\u201d\nShe drew a deep breath and let it out in a sigh. \u201cthen came those who saw a thing and thought of changing it. they thought in terms of mastery.\n\u201cthey were shapers. proud dreamers.\u201d She made a conciliatory gesture. \u201cand it was not all bad at first. there were wonders.\u201d Her face lit with memory and her fingers gripped my arm excitedly. \u201conce, sitting on the walls of murella, I ate fruit from a silver tree. it shone, and in the dark you could mark the mouth and eyes of all those who had tasted it!\u201d\n\u201cWas Murella in the Fae?\u201d", "Felurian frowned. \u201cno. I have said. this was before. there was but one sky. one moon. one world, and in it was murella. and the fruit. and myself, eating it, eyes shining in the dark.\u201d\n\u201cHow long ago was this?\u201d\nShe gave a small shrug. \u201clong ago.\u201d\nLong ago. Longer than any book of history I had ever seen or even heard\nof. The Archives had copies of Caluptenian histories that went back two millennia, and none of them held the barest whisper of the things Felurian spoke of.\n\u201cForgive my interruption,\u201d I said as politely as possible, and made as much of a bow to her as I could without going entirely underwater.\nMollified, she continued, \u201cthe fruit was but the first of it. the early toddlings of a child. they grew bolder, braver, wild. the old knowers said \u2018stop,\u2019 but the shapers refused. they quarreled and fought and forbade the shapers. they argued against mastery of this sort.\u201d Her eyes brightened. \u201cbut oh,\u201d she sighed, \u201cthe things they made!\u201d\nThis from a woman weaving me a cloak out of shadow. I couldn\u2019t guess what she might marvel at. \u201cWhat did they make?\u201d\nShe gestured widely around us.\n\u201cTrees?\u201d I asked, awestruck.\nShe laughed at my tone. \u201cno. the faen realm.\u201d she waved widely. \u201cwrought\naccording to their will. the greatest of them sewed it from whole cloth. a place where they could do as they desired. and at the end of all their work, each shaper wrought a star to fill their new and empty sky.\u201d\nFelurian smiled at me. \u201cthen there were two worlds. two skies. two sets of stars.\u201d She held up the smooth stone. \u201cbut still one moon. and it all round and cozy in the mortal sky.\u201d\nHer smile faded. \u201cbut one shaper was greater than the rest. for him the making of a star was not enough. he stretched his will across the world and pulled her from her home.\u201d\nLifting the smooth stone to the sky, Felurian carefully closed one eye. She tilted her head as if trying to fit the curve of the stone into the empty arms of the crescent moon above us. \u201cthat was the breaking point. the old knowers realized no talk would ever stop the shapers.\u201d Her hand dropped back into the water. \u201che stole the moon and with it came the war.\u201d\n\u201cWho was it?\u201d I asked.\nHer mouth curved into a tiny smile. She hooted: \u201cwho? who?\u201d", "\u201cWas he of the faen courts?\u201d I prompted gently.\nFelurian shook her head, amused. \u201cno. as I said, this was before the fae. the first and greatest of the shapers.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was his name?\u201d\nShe shook her head. \u201cno calling of names here. I will not speak of that one, though he is shut beyond the doors of stone.\u201d\nBefore I could ask more questions, Felurian took my hand and nestled the stone between our palms again. \u201cthis shaper of the dark and changing eye stretched out his hand against the pure black sky. he pulled the moon, but could not make her stay. so now she moves \u2019twixt mortal and the fae.\u201d\nShe gave me a solemn look, so rare a thing on her fair face. \u201cyou have your tale. your who and how. there is a final secret now. so all your owlish listening lend.\u201d She brought our joined hands back to the surface of the water. \u201cthis is the part on which you must attend.\u201d\nFelurian\u2019s eyes were black in the dim light. \u201cthe moon has our two worlds beguiled, like parents clutching at a child, pulling at her, to and fro, neither willing to let go.\u201d\nShe stepped away, and we stood as far apart as we could, the stone gripped in our hands. \u201cwhen she is torn, half in your sky, you see how far apart we lie.\u201d Felurian reached toward me with her free hand making futile grasping gestures in the empty water. \u201cno matter how we long to kiss, the space between us is not ripe for this.\u201d\nFelurian stepped forward and pressed the stone close to my chest. \u201cand when your moon is waxing full, all of faerie feels the pull. she draws us close to you, so bright. and now a visit for a night is easier than walking through a door or stepping off a ship that\u2019s near the shore.\u201d She smiled at me.\u201c \u2019twas thus while wandering in the wild, you found Felurian, manling child.\u201d\nThe thought of an entire world of fae creatures drawn close by the swelling moon was troubling. \u201cAnd this is true of any fae?\u201d\nShe shrugged and nodded. \u201chave they the will, and know the way. there are a thousand half-cracked doors that lead between my world and yours.\u201d\n\u201cHow have I never heard of this? It seems it would be hard to miss, Fae dancing on the mortal grass. . . .\u201d\nShe laughed. \u201cbut has not just this come to pass? the world is wide and time is long, but still you say you heard my song before you saw me singing there, brushing moonlight through my hair.\u201d\nI frowned. \u201cStill, it seems I should have seen more signs of those who walk", "between.\u201d\nFelurian shrugged. \u201cmost fae are sly and subtle folk who step as soft as\nchimney smoke. some go among your kind enshaedn, glamoured as a pack mule laden, or wearing gowns to fit a queen.\u201d She gave me a frank look. \u201cwe know enough to not be seen.\u201d\nShe took my hand again. \u201cmany of the darker sort would love to use you for their sport. what keeps these from moonlit trespass? iron, fire, mirror- glass. elm and ash and copper knives, solid-hearted farmer\u2019s wives who know the rules of games we play and give us bread to keep away. but worst of all, my people dread the portion of our power we shed when we set foot on mortal earth.\u201d\n\u201cWe are more trouble than we\u2019re worth,\u201d I admitted, smiling.\nFelurian reached out and touched a finger to my mouth. \u201cwhile she is full you may still laugh, but know there is a darker half.\u201d She spun away to arm\u2019s length, pulling me through the water in a slow spiral. \u201ca clever mortal fears the night without a hint of sweet moonlight.\u201d\nShe began to draw my hand to her chest, dragging me through the water toward her as she spun. \u201con such a night, each step you take might catch you in the dark moon\u2019s wake, and pull you all unwitting into fae.\u201d She stopped and gave me a grim look. \u201cwhere you will have no choice but stay.\u201d\nFelurian took a step backward in the water, tugging at me. \u201cand on such unfamiliar ground, how can a mortal help but drown?\u201d\nI took another step toward her and found nothing beneath my feet. Felurian\u2019s hand was suddenly no longer clasping mine, and black water closed over my head. Blind and choking, I began to thrash desperately, trying to find my way back to the surface.\nAfter a long, terrifying moment, Felurian\u2019s hands caught me and dragged me into the air as if I weighed no more than a kitten. She brought me close to her face, her dark eyes hard and glittering.\nWhen she spoke her voice was clear. \u201cI do this so you cannot help but hear. a wise man views a moonless night with fear.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THREE": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THREE\nClose Enough to Touch\nTIME PASSED. FELURIAN TOOK me Dayward to a piece of forest even older and grander than the one that surrounded her twilight glade. There we climbed trees as tall and broad as mountains. In the highest branches, you could feel the vast tree swaying in the wind like a ship on the swelling sea. There, with nothing but the blue sky around us and the slow motion of the tree beneath, Felurian taught me ivy on the oak.\nI tried to teach Felurian tak, only to discover she already knew it. She beat me handily, and played a game so lovely Bredon would have wept to look on it.\nI learned a bit of the Fae tongue. A small bit. A scattering.\nActually, in the interest of pure honesty, I will admit that I failed miserably in my attempt to learn the Fae language. Felurian was a less than patient teacher, and the language bafflingly complex. My failure went beyond mere incompetence to the point where Felurian actually forbade me from attempting to speak it in her presence.\nOverall, I gained a few phrases and a great dollop of humility. Useful things.\nFelurian taught me several faen songs. They were harder for me to remember than mortal songs, their melodies slippery and twisting. When I tried to play them on my lute the strings felt strange beneath my fingers, making me fumble and stutter as if I was some country boy who\u2019d never held a lute before. I learned their lyrics by rote, without the least inkling what the words might mean.\nThrough it all, we continued to work on my shaed. Rather, Felurian worked on it. I asked questions, watched, and tried to avoid feeling like a curious child underfoot in the kitchen. As we grew more comfortable with each other, my questions became more insistent....\n\u201cBut how?\u201d I asked for the tenth time. \u201cLight hasn\u2019t any weight, any substance. It behaves like a wave. You shouldn\u2019t be able to touch it.\u201d", "Felurian had worked her way up from starlight and was wefting moonlight into the shaed. She didn\u2019t look up from her work when she replied, \u201cso many thoughts, my kvothe. you know too much to be happy.\u201d\nThat sounded uncomfortably like something Elodin would say. I brushed the evasion aside. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be able\u2014\u201d\nShe nudged me with her elbow and I saw both her hands were full. \u201csweet flame,\u201d she said, \u201cbring that to me.\u201d She nodded to a moonbeam that pierced the trees above and touched the ground beside me.\nHer voice bore the familiar, subtle tone of command, and without thinking I grabbed the moonbeam as if it were a hanging vine. For a second I felt it against my fingers, cool and ephemeral. Startled, I froze, and suddenly it was an ordinary moonbeam again. I passed my hand through it several times to no effect.\nSmiling, Felurian reached out and took hold of it as if it were the most natural thing in the world. She touched my cheek with her free hand, then turned her attention to her lap and worked the strand of moonlight into the folds of shadow.", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FOUR": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FOUR\nThe Cthaeh\nAFTER FELURIAN HELPED ME discover what I was capable of, I took a more active hand in the creation of my shaed. Felurian seemed pleased at my progress, but I was frustrated. There were no rules to follow, no facts to remember. Because of this, my quick wit and trouper\u2019s memory were of little use to me, and my progress seemed irritatingly slow.\nEventually, I could touch my shaed without fear of damaging it and change its shape according to my desire. With some practice I could turn it from a short cape to a full hooded mourning cloak or anything in between.\nStill, it would be unfair for me to take even a hair of the credit for its creation. Felurian was the one who gathered the shadow, wove it with moon and fire and daylight. My major contribution was the suggestion that it should have numerous little pockets.\nAfter we took the shaed all the way into daylight, I thought our work was done. My suspicions seemed confirmed when we spent a long stretch of time swimming, singing, and otherwise enjoying each other\u2019s company.\nBut Felurian avoided the topic of the shaed whenever I brought it up. I didn\u2019t mind, as her evasions on the subject were always delightful. Because of this, I had the impression some part of it was left unfinished.\nOne morning we awoke in an embrace, spent perhaps an hour kissing to arouse our appetites, then fell to our breakfast of fruit and fine white bread with honeycomb and olives.\nThen Felurian grew serious and asked me for a piece of iron.\nHer request surprised me. Some time ago I had thought to resume a few of my mundane habits. Using the surface of the pool as a mirror, I used my small razor to shave. At first Felurian had seemed pleased by my smooth cheeks and chin, but when I moved to kiss her she pushed me to arm\u2019s length, snorting as if to clear her nose. She told me I reeked of iron and sent me into the forest telling me not to return until I got the bitter stink of it from my face.\nSo it was with no small amount of curiosity that I dug a piece of broken", "iron buckle out of my travelsack. I held it out to her nervously. The way you might hand a child a sharp knife. \u201cWhy do you need it?\u201d I asked, trying to appear unconcerned.\nFelurian said nothing. She held it tightly between her thumb and two forefingers, as if it were a snake struggling to twist around and bite her. Her mouth made a thin line, and her eyes began to brighten from their customary twilight purple to a deep-water blue.\n\u201cCan I help?\u201d I asked.\nShe laughed. Not the light, chiming laugh I had heard so often, but a wild, fierce laugh. \u201cdo you want to help truly?\u201d she asked. The hand holding the shard of iron trembled slightly.\nI nodded, a little frightened.\n\u201cthen go.\u201d Her eyes were still changing, brightening to a bluish-white. \u201cI do not need flame now, or songs, or questions.\u201d When I didn\u2019t move she made a shooing motion. \u201cgo to the forest. do not wander far, but do not trouble me for the time it takes to love four times.\u201d Her voice had changed slightly too. Though still soft, it had taken on a brittle edge that alarmed me.\nI was about to protest when she gave me a terrible look that sent me scampering mindlessly for the trees.\nI wandered aimlessly for a while, trying to regain my composure. This was difficult, as I was baby-naked and had been shooed away from the presence of serious magic the way a mother sends a bothersome child away from the cookfire.\nStill, I knew I wouldn\u2019t be welcome back in the clearing for some time. So I pointed my face Dayward and set off to explore.\nI can\u2019t say why I wandered so far afield that day. Felurian had warned me to stay close, and I knew it to be good advice. Any of a hundred stories from my childhood told me the danger of wandering in the Fae. Even discounting them, the stories Felurian herself had told should have been enough to keep me close to the safety of her twilight grove.\nMy natural curiosity must take some of the blame, I suppose. But most of it belongs to my bruised pride. Pride and folly, they go together like two tightly grasping hands.\nI walked for the better part of an hour as the sky above me slowly brightened into full daylight. I found a path of sorts, but saw nothing living aside from the occasional butterfly or leaping squirrel.\nWith every step I took, my mood teetered between boredom and anxiety. I", "was in the Fae, after all. I should be seeing marvelous things. Castles of glass. Burning fountains. Bloodthirsty trow. Barefoot old men, eager to give me advice ...\nThe trees gave way to a great grassy plain. All the parts of the Fae Felurian had shown me had been forested. So this seemed a clear sign I was well outside the bounds of where I ought to be.\nStill I continued, enjoying the feel of sunlight on my skin after so long in the dim twilight of Felurian\u2019s glade. The trail I followed seemed to be leading to a lone tree standing in the grassy field. I decided I would go as far as that tree, then head back.\nHowever, after walking for a long while I didn\u2019t seem to be coming much closer to the tree. At first I thought this was another oddity of the Fae, but as I continued to make my stubborn way along the path, the truth became clear. The tree was simply larger than I had thought. Much larger and much farther away.\nThe path did not ultimately lead to the tree. In fact, it curved away from it, avoiding it by more than half a mile. I was considering turning back when a bright flutter of color under the tree\u2019s canopy caught my eye. After a brief struggle, my curiosity won out and I stepped off the path into the long grass.\nIt was no type of tree I had ever seen before, and I approached it slowly. It resembled a vast spreading willow, with broader leaves of a darker green. The tree had deep, hanging foliage scattered with pale, powder-blue blossoms.\nThe wind shifted, and as the leaves stirred I smelled a strange, sweet smell. It was like smoke and spice and leather and lemon. It was a compelling smell. Not in the same way that food smells appealing. It didn\u2019t make my mouth water or my stomach growl. Despite this, if I\u2019d seen something sitting on a table that smelled this way, even if it were a lump of stone or a piece of wood, I would have felt compelled to put it in my mouth. Not out of hunger, but from sheer curiosity, much like a child might.\nAs I stepped closer I was struck with the beauty of the scene: the deep green of the leaves contrasted with the butterflies flitting from branch to branch, sipping from the pale blossoms of the tree. What I had taken at first to be a bed of flowers beneath the tree turned out to be a carpet of butterflies almost completely covering the ground. The scene was so breathtaking I stopped several dozen feet away from the tree\u2019s canopy, not wanting to startle them into flight.", "Many of the butterflies flitting among the flowers were purple and black, or blue and black, like those in Felurian\u2019s clearing. Others were a solid, vibrant green, or grey and yellow, or silver and blue. But my eye was caught by a single large red one, crimson shot through with a faint tracery of metallic gold. Its wings were bigger than my spread hand, and as I watched it fluttered deeper into the foliage in search of a fresh flower to light upon.\nSuddenly, its wings were no longer moving in concert. They tumbled apart and fluttered separately to the ground like falling autumn leaves.\nIt was only after my eyes followed them to the base of the tree that I saw the truth. The ground below was not a resting place for butterflies . . . it was strewn with lifeless wings. Thousands of them littered the grass beneath the tree\u2019s canopy, like a blanket of gemstones.\n\u201cThe red ones offend my aesthetic,\u201d claimed a cool, dry voice from the tree.\nI took a step back, trying to peer through the thick canopy of hanging leaves.\n\u201cWhat manners,\u201d chided the dry voice. \u201cNo introduction? Staring?\u201d\n\u201cMy apologies, sir,\u201d I said earnestly. Then, remembering the tree\u2019s flowers, I amended, \u201cMa\u2019am. But I have never spoken with a tree before and find myself at something of a loss.\u201d\n\u201cI daresay you are. I am no tree. No more than is a man a chair. I am the Cthaeh. You are fortunate to find me. Many would envy you your chance.\u201d\n\u201cChance?\u201d I echoed, trying to catch a glimpse of whatever was speaking to me from among the branches of the tree. A piece of an old story tickled my memory, some scrap of folklore I\u2019d read while searching for the Chandrian. \u201cYou\u2019re an oracle,\u201d I said.\n\u201cOracle. How quaint. Do not try to pin me with small names. I am Cthaeh. I am. I see. I know.\u201d Two iridescent blue-black wings fluttered separately where there had been a butterfly before. \u201cAt times I speak.\u201d\n\u201cI thought the red ones offended you?\u201d\n\u201cThere are no red ones left.\u201d The voice was nonchalant. \u201cAnd the blue ones are ever so slightly sweet.\u201d I saw a flicker of movement, and another pair of sapphire wings began spinning slowly to the ground. \u201cYou\u2019re Felurian\u2019s new manling, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I hesitated, but the dry voice continued as if I\u2019d answered. \u201cI thought as much. I can smell the iron on you. Just a hint. Still, one has to wonder how she stands it.\u201d\nA pause. A blur. A slight disturbance of a dozen leaves. Two more wings", "twitched, then fluttered downward. \u201cCome now,\u201d the voice continued, now coming from a different part of the tree, though still hidden by the hanging leaves. \u201cSurely a curious boy is bound to have a question or two. Come. Ask. Your silence much offends me.\u201d\nI hesitated, then said, \u201cI suppose I might have a question or two.\u201d \u201cAhhhh,\u201d the sound was slow and satisfied. \u201cI thought you might.\u201d \u201cWhat can you tell me of the Amyr?\u201d\n\u201cKyxxs,\u201d the Cthaeh spat an irritated noise. \u201cWhat is this? Why so\nguarded? Why the games? Ask me of the Chandrian and have done.\u201d\nI stood, stunned and silent.\n\u201cSurprised? Why should you be? Goodness boy, you\u2019re like a clear pool. I\ncan see ten feet through you, and you\u2019re barely three feet deep.\u201d There was another blur of motion and two pairs of wings went spinning to the ground, one blue, one purple.\nI thought I saw a sinuous motion among the branches, but it was hidden by the endless, wind-brushed swaying of the tree. \u201cWhy the purple one?\u201d I asked, simply to have something to say.\n\u201cPure spite,\u201d the Cthaeh said. \u201cI envied its innocence, its lack of care. Besides, too much sweetness cloys me. As does willful ignorance.\u201d A pause. \u201cYou wish to ask me of the Chandrian, do you not?\u201d\nI could do nothing but nod.\n\u201cNot much to say really,\u201d the Cthaeh remarked flippantly. \u201cYou would do better to call them the Seven though. \u2018Chandrian\u2019 has so much folklore hanging off it after all these years. The names used to be interchangeable, but nowadays if you say Chandrian people think of ogres and rendlings and scaven. Such silliness.\u201d\nThere was a long pause. I stood motionless until I realized the creature was waiting for a response. \u201cTell me more,\u201d I said. My voice sounded terribly thin to my own ears.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I thought I detected a playful note in the voice.\n\u201cBecause I need to know,\u201d I said, trying to force some strength back into my voice.\n\u201cNeed?\u201d Cthaeh asked skeptically. \u201cWhy this sudden need? The masters at the University might know the answers you\u2019re looking for. But they wouldn\u2019t tell you even if you did ask, which you won\u2019t. You\u2019re too proud for that. Too clever to ask for help. Too mindful of your reputation.\u201d\nI tried to speak, but my throat did nothing but make a dry clicking sound. I", "swallowed and tried again. \u201cPlease, I need to know. They killed my parents.\u201d \u201cAre you going to try to kill the Chandrian?\u201d The voice sounded\nfascinated, almost taken aback. \u201cTrack and kill them all yourself? My word, how will you manage it? Haliax has been alive five thousand years. Five thousand years and not one second\u2019s sleep.\n\u201cClever to go looking for the Amyr, I suppose. Even one proud as you can recognize the need for help. The Order might give it to you. Trouble is they\u2019re as hard to find as the Seven themselves. Oh dear, oh dear. Whatever is a brave young boy to do?\u201d\n\u201cTell me!\u201d I meant to shout it, but it came out pleading.\n\u201cIt would be frustrating, I suppose,\u201d the Cthaeh continued calmly. \u201cThe few people who believe in the Chandrian are too afraid to talk, and everyone else will just laugh at you for asking.\u201d There was a dramatic sigh that seemed to come from several places in the foliage at once. \u201cThat\u2019s the price you pay for civilization though.\u201d\n\u201cWhat price?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cArrogance,\u201d the Cthaeh said. \u201cYou assume you know everything. You laughed at faeries until you saw one. Small wonder all your civilized neighbors dismiss the Chandrian as well. You\u2019d have to leave your precious corners far behind before you found someone who might take you seriously. You wouldn\u2019t have a hope until you made it to the Stormwal.\u201d\nThere was a pause, then another pair of purple wings went drifting to the ground. I swallowed against the dryness in my throat, trying to think of what question I could ask to get more information.\n\u201cNot many folk will take your search for the Amyr seriously, you realize,\u201d the Cthaeh continued calmly. \u201cThe Maer, however, is quite the extraordinary man. He\u2019s already come close to them, though he doesn\u2019t realize it. Stick by the Maer and he will lead you to their door.\u201d\nThe Cthaeh gave a thin, dry chuckle. \u201cBlood, bracken, and bone, I wish you creatures had the wit to appreciate me. Whatever else you might forget, remember what I just said. Eventually you\u2019ll get the joke. I guarantee. You\u2019ll laugh when the time comes.\u201d\n\u201cWhat can you tell me about the Chandrian?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cSince you ask so sweetly, Cinder is the one you want. Remember him? White hair? Dark eyes? Did things to your mother, you know. Terrible. She held up well though. Laurian was always a trouper, if you\u2019ll pardon the expression. Much better than your father, with all his begging and", "blubbering.\u201d\nMy mind flashed pictures of things I had tried to forget for years. My\nmother, her hair wet with blood, her arms unnaturally twisted, broken at the wrist, the elbow. My father, his belly cut open, had left a trail of blood for twenty feet. He\u2019d crawled to be closer to her. I tried to speak, but my mouth was dry. \u201cWhy?\u201d I managed to croak.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d the Cthaeh echoed. \u201cWhat a good question. I know so many whys. Why did they do such nasty things to your poor family? Why, because they wanted to, and because they could, and because they had a reason.\n\u201cWhy did they leave you alive? Why, because they were sloppy, and because you were lucky, and because something scared them away.\u201d\nWhat scared them away? I thought numbly. But it was all too much. The memories, the things the voice said. My mouth worked silently, questioning.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d the Cthaeh asked. \u201cAre you looking for a different why? Are you wondering why I tell you these things? What good comes of it? Maybe this Cinder did me a bad turn once. Maybe it amuses me to set a young pup like you snapping at his heels. Maybe the soft creaking of your tendons as you clench your fists is like a sweet symphony to me. Oh yes it is. And you can be sure.\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you find this Cinder? Well, that\u2019s an interesting why. You\u2019d think a man with coal-black eyes would make an impression when he stops to buy a drink. How can it be that you haven\u2019t managed to catch wind of him in all this time?\u201d\nI shook my head, trying to clear it of the smell of blood and burning hair.\nThe Cthaeh seemed to take it as a signal. \u201cThat\u2019s right, I suppose you don\u2019t need me to tell you what he looks like. You\u2019ve seen him just a day or three ago.\u201d\nRealization thundered into me. The leader of the bandits. The graceful man in chain mail. Cinder. He was the one who had spoken to me when I was a child. The man with the terrible smile and the sword like winter ice.\n\u201cPity he got away,\u201d the Cthaeh continued. \u201cStill, you must admit you\u2019ve had quite a piece of luck. I\u2019d say it was a twice-in-a-lifetime-opportunity meeting up with him again. Pity you wasted it. Don\u2019t feel bad you didn\u2019t recognize him. They have a lot of experience hiding those telltale signs. Not your fault at all. It\u2019s been a long time. Years. Besides, you\u2019ve been busy: currying favor, rolling around in the cushions with some piksie, sating your base desires.\u201d", "Three green butterflies twitched all at once. Their wings looked like leaves as they spun to the ground.\n\u201cSpeaking of desires, what would your Denna think? My my. Imagine her, seeing you here. You and the piksie all tangled up, at it like rabbits. He beats her, you know. Her patron. Not all the time, but often. Sometimes in a temper, but mostly it\u2019s a game to him. How far can he go before she cries? How far can he push before she tries to leave and he has to lure her back again? It\u2019s nothing grotesque, mind you. No burns. Nothing that will leave a scar. Not yet.\n\u201cTwo days ago he used his walking stick. That was new. Welts the size of your thumb under her clothes. Bruises down to the bone. She\u2019s trembling on the floor with blood in her mouth and you know what she thinks before the black? You. She thinks of you. You thought of her too, I\u2019m guessing. In between the swimming and strawberries and the rest.\u201d\nThe Cthaeh made a sound like a sigh. \u201cPoor girl, she\u2019s tied to him so tight. Thinks that\u2019s all she\u2019s good for. Wouldn\u2019t leave him even if you asked. Which you won\u2019t. You, so careful. So scared of startling her away. And well you should be too. She\u2019s a runner, that one. Now that she\u2019s left Severen, how can you hope to find her?\n\u201cIt is a shame you left without a word, you know. She was just beginning to trust you before that. Before you got angry. Before you ran off. Just like every other man in her life. Just like every other man. Lusting after her, full of sweet words, then just walking away. Leaving her alone. Good thing she\u2019s used to it by now, isn\u2019t it? Otherwise you might have hurt her. Otherwise you just might have broken that poor girl\u2019s heart.\u201d\nIt was all too much. I turned and ran, pelting madly back the way I had come. Back to the quiet twilight of Felurian\u2019s clearing. Away. Away. Away.\nAnd as I ran I could hear Cthaeh speaking behind me. Its dry, quiet voice followed me longer than I would have thought possible. \u201cCome back. Come back. I\u2019ve more to say. I\u2019ve so much more to tell you, won\u2019t you stay?\u201d\nIt was hours before I came back to Felurian\u2019s clearing. I\u2019m not sure how I found my way. I only remember being surprised at the sight of her pavilion through the trees. The sight of it slowed the mad spinning of my thoughts\n \nuntil I could begin to think again.\nI went to the pool and took a long, deep drink, splashing water on my face\nto clear my head and hide the signs of tears. After a moment or two of quiet reflection, I stood and walked to the pavilion. It was only then that I noticed a curious lack of butterflies. There were usually at least a handful flitting around, but now there were none.\nFelurian was there, but the sight of her only unsettled me further. It was the only time I had ever seen her look less than perfectly beautiful. She lay among the cushions, drawn and weary. As if I had been gone for days instead of hours, and she had not eaten or slept all the while.\nShe lifted her head tiredly when she heard me approach. \u201cit is done,\u201d she said, but when she looked at me her eyes widened with surprise.\nI looked down and saw that I was bramble-torn and bloody. I was spattered with mud and grass stained along my entire left side. I must have fallen during my mindless flight away from the Cthaeh.\nFelurian sat upright. \u201cwhat has come of you?\u201d\nI brushed absently at a bit of dried blood on my elbow. \u201cI might ask the same of you.\u201d My voice sounded thick and coarse, as if I had been shouting. When I looked up I saw real concern in her eyes. \u201cI went walking Dayward. I found something in a tree. It called itself a Cthaeh.\u201d\nFelurian went motionless when I spoke its name. \u201cthe Cthaeh? did you speak?\u201d\nI nodded.\n\u201cdid you ask of it?\u201d But before I could answer she gave a quiet, despairing cry and rushed to me. She began to run her hands over my body, as if searching for wounds. After a minute of this she took my face in her hands and looked into my eyes as if frightened of what she might find there. \u201care you well?\u201d\nHer concern brought a faint smile to my lips. I began to assure her that I was fine\u2014then I remembered the things the Cthaeh had said. I remembered the fires and the man with ink-black eyes. I thought of Denna sprawled on the floor with a mouthful of blood. Tears came to my eyes and I choked. I turned away and shook my head, eyes clenched shut and unable to speak.\nShe stroked the back of my neck and said, \u201call is well. the hurt will go. it has not bit you, and your eyes are clear, so all is well.\u201d\nI pulled away from her enough to look her in the face. \u201cMy eyes?\u201d \u201cthe things the Cthaeh says can leave men broken in their heads. but I", "would see if it were so. you are still my kvothe, still my sweet poet.\u201d She leaned forward, oddly hesitant, then gave me a gentle kiss on my forehead.\n\u201cIt lies to men and drives them mad?\u201d\nShe shook her head slowly, \u201cthe Cthaeh does not lie. it has the gift of seeing, but it only tells things to hurt men. only a dennerling would speak to the Cthaeh.\u201d She touched the side of my neck to soften her words.\nI nodded, knowing it to be the truth. And I began to cry.", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIVE": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIVE\nInterlude\u2014A Certain Sweetness\nKVOTHE MOTIONED FOR CHRONICLER to stop writing. \u201cAre you all right, Bast?\u201d He gave his student a look of concern. \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve swallowed a lump of iron.\u201d\nBast did look stricken. His face was pale, almost waxy. His normally cheerful expression was aghast. \u201cReshi,\u201d he said, his voice as dry as autumn leaves. \u201cYou never told me you spoke with the Cthaeh.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things I\u2019ve never told you, Bast,\u201d Kvothe said flippantly. \u201cThat\u2019s why you find the sordid details of my life so enthralling.\u201d\nBast gave a sickly smile, shoulders sagging with relief. \u201cYou didn\u2019t really, then. Talk with it, I mean? It\u2019s something you just added to make things a little more colorful?\u201d\n\u201cPlease, Bast,\u201d Kvothe said, obviously offended. \u201cMy story has quite enough color without my adding to it.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me!\u201d Bast shouted suddenly, coming halfway out of his seat with the force of it. \u201cDon\u2019t you lie to me about this! Don\u2019t you dare!\u201d Bast struck the table with one hand, toppling his mug and sending Chronicler\u2019s inkwell skittering across the table.\nQuick as blinking, Chronicler snatched up the half-covered sheet of paper and pushed his chair back from the table with his feet, saving the sheet from the sudden spray of ink and beer.\nBast leaned forward, his face livid as he stabbed a finger at Kvothe. \u201cI don\u2019t care what other shit you spin into gold here! But you don\u2019t lie about this, Reshi! Not to me!\u201d\nKvothe gestured to where Chronicler sat, holding the pristine sheet of paper in the air with both hands. \u201cBast,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is my chance to tell the full and honest story of my life. Everything is\u2014\u201d\nBast closed his eyes and pounded the table like a child in the grip of a tantrum. \u201cShut up. Shut up! SHUT UP!\u201d\nBast pointed at Chronicler. \u201cI don\u2019t give a fiddler\u2019s fuck what you tell him,", "Reshi. He\u2019ll write what I say or I\u2019ll eat his heart in the market square!\u201d He turned the finger back to the innkeeper and shook it furiously. \u201cBut you\u2019ll tell me the truth and you\u2019ll tell me now!\u201d\nKvothe looked up at his student, the amusement bleeding out of his face. \u201cBast, we both know I\u2019m not above the occasional embellishment. But this story is different. This is my chance to get the truth of matters recorded. It\u2019s the truth behind the stories.\u201d\nThe dark young man hunched forward in his chair and covered his eyes with one hand.\nKvothe looked at him, his face full of concern. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d Bast shook his head, still covering his eyes.\n\u201cBast,\u201d Kvothe said gently. \u201cYour hand is bleeding.\u201d He waited a long\nmoment before asking, \u201cBast, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s just it!\u201d Bast burst out, throwing his arms wide, his voice high and\nhysterical. \u201cI think I finally understand what the matter is!\u201d\nBast laughed then, but it was loud and strained, and choked off into\nsomething that sounded like a sob. He looked up at the rafters of the taproom, his eyes bright. He blinked, as if fighting back tears.\nKvothe leaned forward to lay his hand on the young man\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBast, please . . .\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that you know so many things,\u201d Bast said. \u201cYou know all sorts of things you\u2019re not supposed to. You know about the Berentaltha. You know about the white sisters and the laughing-way. How can you not know about the Cthaeh? It\u2019s . . . it\u2019s a monster.\u201d\nKvothe relaxed visibly. \u201cGood Lord, Bast, is that all? You had me all in a sweat. I\u2019ve faced down things far worse than\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t anything worse than the Cthaeh!\u201d Bast shouted, bringing his clenched fist down on the tabletop again. This time there was the sharp sound of tearing wood as one of the thick timbers bowed and cracked. \u201cReshi, shut up and listen. Really listen.\u201d Bast looked down for a moment, choosing his words carefully. \u201cYou know who the Sithe are?\u201d\nKvothe shrugged. \u201cThey\u2019re a faction among the Fae. Powerful, with good intentions\u2014\u201d\nBast waved his hands. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand them if you use the term \u2018good intentions.\u2019 But if any of the Fae can be said to work for the good, it\u2019s them. Their oldest and most important charge is to keep the Cthaeh from having any contact with anyone. With anyone.\u201d", "\u201cI didn\u2019t see any guards,\u201d Kvothe said in the tones a man might use to soothe a skittish animal.\nBast ran his hands through his hair, leaving it in disarray. \u201cI can\u2019t for all the salt in me guess how you slipped past them, Reshi. If anyone manages to come in contact with the Cthaeh, the Sithe kill them. They kill them from a half-mile off with their long horn bows. Then they leave the body to rot. If a crow so much as lands on the body, they kill it too.\u201d\nChronicler cleared his throat gently, then spoke up. \u201cIf what you\u2019re saying is true,\u201d he asked, \u201cwhy would anyone go to the Cthaeh?\u201d\nBast looked for a moment as if he would snap at the scribe, then gave a bitter sigh instead. \u201cIn all fairness, my people are not known for making good decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery Fae girl and boy knows the Cthaeh\u2019s nature, but there\u2019s always someone eager to seek it out. Folk go to it for answers or a glimpse of the future. Or they hope to come away with a flower.\u201d\n\u201cA flower?\u201d Kvothe asked.\nBast gave him another startled look. \u201cThe Rhinna?\u201d Not seeing any recognition in the innkeeper\u2019s face he shook his head in dismay. \u201cThe flowers are a panacea, Reshi. They can heal any illness. Cure any poison. Mend any wound.\u201d\nKvothe raised his eyebrows at that. \u201cAh,\u201d he said, looking down at his folded hands on the tabletop. \u201cI see. I can understand how that might draw a person in, though they knew better.\u201d\nThe innkeeper looked up. \u201cI have to admit I don\u2019t see the trouble,\u201d he said apologetically. \u201cI\u2019ve seen monsters, Bast. The Cthaeh falls short of that.\u201d \u201cThat was the wrong word for me to use, Reshi,\u201d Bast admitted. \u201cBut I\ncan\u2019t think of a better one. If there was a word that meant poisonous and hateful and contagious, I\u2019d use that.\u201d\nBast drew a deep breath and leaned forward in his chair. \u201cReshi, the Cthaeh can see the future. Not in some vague, oracular way. It sees all the future. Clearly. Perfectly. Everything that can possibly come to pass, branching out endlessly from the current moment.\u201d\nKvothe raised an eyebrow. \u201cIt can, can it?\u201d\n\u201cIt can,\u201d Bast said gravely. \u201cAnd it is purely, perfectly malicious. This isn\u2019t a problem for the most part, as it can\u2019t leave the tree. But when someone comes to visit ...\u201d\nKvothe\u2019s eyes went distant as he nodded to himself. \u201cIf it knows the future perfectly,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cthen it must know exactly how a person will react", "to anything it says.\u201d\nBast nodded. \u201cAnd it is vicious, Reshi.\u201d\nKvothe continued in a musing tone. \u201cThat means anyone influenced by the\nCthaeh would be like an arrow shot into the future.\u201d\n\u201cAn arrow only hits one person, Reshi.\u201d Bast\u2019s dark eyes were hollow and\nhopeless. \u201cAnyone influenced by the Cthaeh is like a plague ship sailing for a harbor.\u201d Bast pointed at the half-filled sheet Chronicler held in his lap. \u201cIf the Sithe knew that existed, they would spare no effort to destroy it. They would kill us for having heard what the Cthaeh said.\u201d\n\u201cBecause anything carrying the Cthaeh\u2019s influence away from the tree . . .\u201d Kvothe said, looking down at his hands. He sat silently for a long moment, nodding thoughtfully. \u201cSo a young man seeking his fortune goes to the Cthaeh and takes away a flower. The daughter of the king is deathly ill, and he takes the flower to heal her. They fall in love despite the fact that she\u2019s betrothed to the neighboring prince ...\u201d\nBast stared at Kvothe, watching blankly as he spoke.\n\u201cThey attempt a daring moonlight escape,\u201d Kvothe continued. \u201cBut he falls from the rooftops and they\u2019re caught. The princess is married against her will and stabs the neighboring prince on their wedding night. The prince dies. Civil war. Fields burned and salted. Famine. Plague . . .\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the story of the Fastingsway War,\u201d Bast said faintly.\nKvothe nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the stories Felurian told. I never understood the part about the flower until now. She never mentioned the Cthaeh.\u201d\n\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have, Reshi. It\u2019s considered bad luck.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNo, not bad luck. It\u2019s like spitting poison in someone\u2019s ear. It simply isn\u2019t done.\u201d\nChronicler recovered some of his composure and slid his chair back toward the table, still holding the sheet carefully. He frowned at the table, broken and streaked with beer and ink. \u201cIt seems like this creature has quite a reputation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I find it hard to believe it\u2019s quite as dangerous as all that. . . .\u201d\nBast looked at Chronicler incredulously. \u201cIron and bile,\u201d he said, his voice quiet. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m a child? You think I don\u2019t know the difference between a campfire story and the truth?\u201d\nChronicler made a mollifying gesture with one hand. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I ...\u201d\nWithout taking his eyes from Chronicler, Bast laid his bloody palm flat on the table. The wood groaned and the broken timbers snapped back into place", "with a sudden crackling sound. Bast lifted his hand, then brought it down sharply on the table, and the dark runnels of ink and beer suddenly twisted and shaped themselves into a jet-black crow that burst into flight, circling the taproom once.\nBast caught it with both hands and tore the bird carelessly in half, casting the pieces into the air where they exploded into great washes of flame the color of blood.\nIt all happened in the space of a single breath. \u201cEverything you know about the Fae could fit inside a thimble,\u201d Bast said, looking at the scribe with no expression at all, his voice flat and even. \u201cHow dare you doubt me? You have no idea who I am.\u201d\nChronicler sat very still, but he did not look away.\n\u201cI swear it by my tongue and teeth,\u201d Bast said crisply. \u201cI swear it on the doors of stone. I am telling you three thousand times. There is nothing in my world or yours more dangerous than the Cthaeh.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that, Bast,\u201d Kvothe said softly. \u201cI believe you.\u201d\nBast turned to look at Kvothe, then sagged miserably in his chair. \u201cI wish you didn\u2019t, Reshi.\u201d\nKvothe gave a wry smile. \u201cSo after a person meets the Cthaeh, all their choices will be the wrong ones.\u201d\nBast shook his head, his face pale and drawn. \u201cNot wrong, Reshi, catastrophic. Iax spoke to the Cthaeh before he stole the moon, and that sparked the entire creation war. Lanre spoke to the Cthaeh before he orchestrated the betrayal of Myr Tariniel. The creation of the Nameless. The Scaendyne. They can all be traced back to the Cthaeh.\u201d\nKvothe\u2019s expression went blank. \u201cWell, that certainly puts me in interesting company, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d he said dryly.\n\u201cIt does more than that, Reshi,\u201d Bast said. \u201cIn our plays, if the Cthaeh\u2019s tree is shown in the distance in the backdrop, you know the story is going to be the worst kind of tragedy. It\u2019s put there so the audience knows what to expect. So they know everything will go terribly wrong in the end.\u201d\nKvothe looked at Bast for a long moment. \u201cOh Bast,\u201d he said softly to his student. His smile was gentle and sad. \u201cI know what sort of story I\u2019m telling. This is no comedy.\u201d\nBast looked up at him with hollow, hopeless eyes. \u201cBut Reshi ...\u201d His mouth moved, trying to find words and failing.\nThe red-haired innkeeper gestured at the empty taproom. \u201cThis is the end", "of the story, Bast. We all know that.\u201d Kvothe\u2019s voice was matter-of-fact, as casual as if he were describing yesterday\u2019s weather. \u201cI have led an interesting life, and this reminiscence has a certain sweetness to it. But . . .\u201d\nKvothe drew a deep breath and let it out gently. \u201c. . . but this is not a dashing romance. This is no fable where folk come back from the dead. It\u2019s not a rousing epic meant to stir the blood. No. We all know what kind of story this is.\u201d\nIt seemed for a moment that he would continue, but instead his eyes wandered idly around the empty taproom. His face was calm, without a trace of anger or bitterness.\nBast darted a look at Chronicler, but this time there was no fire in it. No anger. No fury or command. Bast\u2019s eyes were desperate, pleading.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not over if you\u2019re still here,\u201d Chronicler said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a tragedy if you\u2019re still alive.\u201d\nBast nodded eagerly at this, looking back at Kvothe.\nKvothe looked at both of them for a moment, then smiled and chuckled low in his chest. \u201cOh,\u201d he said fondly. \u201cYou\u2019re both so young.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX\nReturning\nAFTER MY ENCOUNTER WITH the Cthaeh, it was a long time before I was my right self again.\nI slept a great deal, but only fitfully as I was endlessly set upon by terrible dreams. Some of them were vivid and impossible to forget. These were mostly of my mother, my father, my troupe. Worse were the ones where I woke weeping with no memory of what I\u2019d dreamed, only an aching chest and an emptiness in my head like the bloody gap left by a missing tooth.\nThe first time I awoke like this, Felurian was there, watching me. Her expression was so gentle and worried that I expected her to murmur softly to me and stroke my hair, as Auri had done in my room months ago.\nBut Felurian did nothing of the sort. \u201care you well?\u201d she asked.\nI had no answer for this. I was blurry with memory, confusion, and grief. Not trusting myself to speak without bursting into tears again, I merely shook my head.\nFelurian bent down and kissed me on the corner of my mouth, looked at me for a long moment, and sat back up. Then she went to the pool and brought me back a drink of water in her cupped hands.\nOver the following days Felurian did not press me with questions or try to draw me out. She occasionally tried to tell me stories, but I couldn\u2019t focus on them, so they made less sense than ever. Some parts made me weep uncontrollably, though the stories themselves had nothing in them that was sad.\nOnce I woke to find her gone, only to have her return hours later carrying a strange green fruit bigger than my head. She smiled shyly and handed it to me, showing me how to peel off the thin leathery skin to reveal the orange meat inside. Pulpy and tangy-sweet, it pulled apart in spiraling segments.\nWe ate these silently, until nothing was left but a round, hard, slippery seed. It was dark brown and so big I could not close my hand around it. With a slight flourish, Felurian cracked this open against a rock and showed me", "that the inside was dry, like a roasted nut. We ate this too. It tasted dark and peppery, vaguely reminiscent of smoked salmon.\nNestled inside that was another seed, white as bone and the size of a marble. This Felurian gave to me. It was candy-sweet and slightly gummy, like a caramel.\nOne time she left me alone for endless hours, only to return with two brown birds, one carefully cupped in each hand. They were smaller than sparrows, with striking, leaf-green eyes. She set them down next to where I lay on the cushions, and when she whistled, they began to sing. Not snippets of birdsong, they sang an actual song. Four verses with a chorus between. First they sang together, then in a simple harmony.\nOnce I woke and she gave me a drink in a leather cup. It smelled of violets and tasted of nothing at all, but it was clear and warm and clean in my mouth, like I was drinking summer sunlight.\nAnother time she gave me a smooth red stone that was warm in my hand. After several hours it hatched like an egg, revealing a creature like a tiny squirrel that chittered angrily at me before running away.\nOnce I woke and she was not nearby. Looking around I saw her sitting on the edge of the water, arms wrapped around her knees. I could barely hear the gentle song of her sobbing quietly to herself.\nI slept and I woke. She gave me a ring made from a leaf, a cluster of golden berries, a flower that opened and closed at the stroking of a finger....\nAnd once, when I startled awake with my face wet and my chest aching, she reached out to lay her hand on top of mine. The gesture was so tentative, her expression so anxious, you would think she had never touched a man before. As if she was worried I might break or burn or bite. Her cool hand lay on mine for a moment, gentle as a moth. She squeezed my hand softly, waited, then pulled away.\nIt struck me as odd at the time. But I was too clouded with confusion and grief to think clearly. Only now, looking back, do I realize the truth of things. With all the awkwardness of a young lover, she was trying to comfort me, and she didn\u2019t have the slightest idea how.\nStill, all things mend with time. My dreams receded. My appetite returned. I\n \ngrew clearheaded enough to banter with Felurian a bit. Shortly after that, I recovered enough to flirt. When this happened, her relief was palpable, as if she couldn\u2019t relate to a creature that did not want to kiss her.\nLast came my curiosity, the surest sign I was my own true self again. \u201cI never asked you how went your final workings with the shaed,\u201d I said.\nHer face lit. \u201cit is done!\u201d I could see the pride in her eyes. She took my hand and pulled me to the edge of the pavilion. \u201cthe iron was not an easy thing, but it is done.\u201d She started forward, then stopped herself. \u201ccan you find it?\u201d\nI took a long, careful look around. Even though she\u2019d taught me what to look for, it was a long moment before I spotted a subtle depth in the darkness of a nearby tree. I reached out and drew my shaed from the concealing shadow.\nFelurian skipped to my side, laughing as if I had just won a game. She caught me around the neck and kissed me with the wildness of a dozen children.\nShe had never let me wear the shaed before, and I marveled as she spread it over my naked shoulders. It was nearly weightless and softer than the richest velvet. It felt like wearing a warm breeze, the same breeze that had brushed me in the darkened forest glade where Felurian had taken me to gather the shadows.\nI thought of going to the forest pool to see how I looked in the water\u2019s reflection, but Felurian threw herself onto me. Bearing me to the ground, she landed astride me, my shaed spread beneath us like a thick blanket. She gathered the edges of it around us, then kissed my chest, my neck. Her tongue was hot against my skin.\n\u201cthis way,\u201d she said against my ear, \u201cwhenever your shaed wraps you, you will think of me. when it touches you it will seem like my touch.\u201d She moved slowly against me, rubbing the length of her naked body along mine. \u201cthrough all the other women you will remember Felurian, and you will return.\u201d\nAfter that I knew my time in the Fae was drawing to a close. The Cthaeh\u2019s words stuck in my mind like burrs, goading me out into the world. The fact\n \nthat I had been within a stone\u2019s throw of the man who had killed my parents and not realized it left a bitter taste in my mouth that even Felurian\u2019s kisses could not erase. And what the Cthaeh had said of Denna kept playing over and over in my head.\nEventually I awoke and knew the time had come. I rose, put my travelsack in order, and dressed for the first time in ages. The feeling of clothes against my skin felt odd after all this time. How long had I been gone? I brushed my fingers through my beard and shrugged the thought away. Guessing was pointless when I would know the answer soon enough.\nTurning, I saw Felurian standing in the center of the pavilion, her expression sad. For a moment I thought she might protest my leaving, but she did nothing of the sort. Moving to my side, she fastened the shaed around my shoulders, reminding me of a mother dressing her child against the cold. Even the butterflies that followed her seemed melancholy.\nShe led me through the forest for hours until we came to a pair of tall greystones. She drew up the hood of my shaed and bid me close my eyes. Then she led me in a brief circle and I felt a subtle change in the air. When I opened my eyes I could tell this forest was not the same one I had been walking through a moment before. The strange tension in the air was gone. This was the mortal world.\nI turned to Felurian. \u201cMy lady,\u201d I said. \u201cI have nothing to give you before I go.\u201d\n\u201cexcept your promise to return.\u201d Her voice was lily soft, with a whisper of a warning.\nI smiled. \u201cI mean I have nothing to leave you with, lady.\u201d\n\u201cexcept remembrance.\u201d She leaned close.\nClosing my eyes, I bid her farewell with few words and many kisses. Then I left. I would like to say I did not look back, but that would not be\nthe truth. The sight of her almost broke my heart. She seemed so very small beside the huge grey stones. I almost went back to give one final kiss, one last good-bye.\nBut I knew if I went back, I would never manage to leave again. Somehow I kept walking.\nWhen I looked back the second time, she was gone.", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SEVEN": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SEVEN\nFire\nI CAME TO THE PENNYSWORTH Inn long after the sun had set. The huge inn\u2019s windows swelled with lamplight and there were a dozen horses tethered outside, champing into their feed bags. The door was open, casting a slant square of light into the dark street.\nBut something was wrong. There was none of the pleasant rousing clamor that should be coming from a busy inn at night. Not a whisper. Not a word.\nAnxious, I crept closer. Every faerie tale I\u2019d ever heard was running through my head. Had I been gone years? Decades?\nOr was it more ordinary trouble? Had there been more bandits than we thought? Had they returned to find their camp destroyed, then come here to make trouble?\nI slid close to a window, peered inside, and saw the truth.\nThere were forty or fifty people in the inn. They sat at tables and benches and lined up at the bar. Every eye was pointed at the hearth.\nMarten sat there, taking a long drink. \u201cI couldn\u2019t look away,\u201d he continued. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to. Then Kvothe stepped in front of me, blocking the sight of her, and for a second I was free of her spell. I was covered in a sweat so thick and cold it felt like someone had thrown a bucket of water over me. I tried to pull him back, but he shook me off and ran to her.\u201d Marten\u2019s expression was lined with regret.\n\u201cHow come she didn\u2019t get the Adem and the big one too?\u201d asked a man with a hawkish face sitting nearby on the corner of the hearth. He drummed his fingers on a battered fiddle case. \u201cIf you\u2019d really seen her, you all would have run off after her.\u201d\nThere was a murmur of agreement from the room.\nTempi spoke up from a nearby table, his blood-red shirt making him easy to spot. \u201cWhen I was growing, I train to have control.\u201d He held up a hand and made a tight fist to illustrate his point. \u201cHurt. Hungry. Thirsty. Tired.\u201d He shook his fist after each of these to show his mastery over it. \u201cWomen.\u201d The", "faintest of smiles touched his face and he shook his fist again, but with none of the firmness he had used before. A murmur of laughter ran through the room. \u201cI say this. If Kvothe did not go, I may.\u201d\nMarten nodded. \u201cAs for our other friend ...\u201d He cleared his throat and gestured across the room. \u201cHespe convinced him to stay.\u201d There was more laughter at this. After a moment of searching I spied where Dedan and Hespe sat. Dedan seemed to be fighting down a furious blush. Hespe rested a hand possessively on his leg. She smiled a private, satisfied smile.\n\u201cThe next day we looked for him,\u201d Marten said, regaining the room\u2019s attention. \u201cWe followed his trail through the woods. We found his sword half a mile from the pool. No doubt he lost it in his haste to catch her. His cloak hung from a branch not far from there.\u201d\nMarten lifted up the threadbare cloak I had bought from the tinker. It looked like it had been savaged by a mad dog. \u201cIt was caught on a branch. He must have torn free rather than lose sight of her.\u201d He idly fingered the ripped edges. \u201cIf it had been made of stronger stuff he might still be with us here tonight.\u201d\nI know my cue when I hear it. I stepped through the doorway and felt everyone turn to look at me. \u201cI have found a better cloak since,\u201d I said. \u201cMade by Felurian\u2019s own hand. And I have a story too. One you will be telling your children\u2019s children.\u201d I smiled.\nThere was a moment of silence, then an uproar as everyone began to speak at once.\nMy companions stared at me in stunned disbelief. Dedan was the first to recover, and after making his way to where I stood, surprised me with a rough, one-armed embrace. Only then did I notice one of his arms was hanging from his neck in a splint.\nI gave it a questioning look. \u201cDid you run into trouble?\u201d I asked while the room buzzed chaotically around us.\nDedan shook his head. \u201cHespe,\u201d he said simply. \u201cShe didn\u2019t take too kindly to the thought of me running off after that faerie woman. She sort of... convinced me to stay.\u201d\n\u201cShe broke your arm?\u201d I remembered my parting glimpse of Hespe holding him to the ground.\nThe big man looked down at his feet. \u201cA bit. She sort of held onto it while I tried to twist away.\u201d He gave a slightly sheepish smile. \u201cI guess you could say we broke it together.\u201d", "I clapped him on his good shoulder and laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s sweet. Truly touching.\u201d I would have continued, but the room had quieted. Everyone was watching us, watching me.\nAs I looked at the crowd of people, I felt suddenly disoriented. How can I explain... ?\nI\u2019ve already told you I don\u2019t know how much time I spent in the Fae. But it had been a long, long while. I had lived there so long, that the strangeness of it had faded. I\u2019d grown comfortable there.\nNow that I was back in the mortal world, this crowded taproom seemed strange to me. How odd to be indoors, rather than under the naked sky. The thick-timbered wooden benches and tables looked so primitive and rough. The lamplight seemed unnaturally bright and harsh to my eyes.\nI\u2019d had no company but Felurian for ages, and the people around me seemed strange by comparison. The whites of their eyes were startling. They smelled like sweat and horses and bitter iron. Their voices were hard and sharp. Their postures stiff and awkward.\nBut that only scratches the bare surface of it. I felt out of place in my own skin. It was profoundly irritating to be wearing clothes again, and I wanted nothing more than to be comfortably naked. My boots felt like a prison. On my long walk to the Pennysworth, I\u2019d had to constantly fight the urge to remove them.\nLooking at the faces around me, I saw a young woman of no more than twenty. She had a sweet face and clear blue eyes. She had a perfect mouth for kissing. I took half a step towards her, fully intending to catch her up in my arms and . . .\nI stopped suddenly, just as I began to reach out with one hand to caress the side of her neck, and my head spun with something very close to vertigo. Things were different here. The man sitting beside the woman was obviously her husband. That was important, wasn\u2019t it? It seemed a very vague and distant fact. Why wasn\u2019t I already kissing this woman? Why wasn\u2019t I naked, eating violets, and playing music underneath the open sky?\nLooking around the room again, everything seemed terribly ridiculous. These people sitting on their benches, wearing layers on layers of clothing, eating with knives and forks. It all struck me as so pointless and contrived. It was incredibly funny. It was like they were playing a game and didn\u2019t even realize it. It was like a joke I\u2019d never understood before.\nAnd so I laughed. It wasn\u2019t loud or particularly long, but it was high and", "wild and full of strange delight. It was no human laugh, and it moved through the crowd like wind among the wheat. Those near enough to hear it shifted in their seats, some looking at me with curiosity, some with fear. Some shivered and refused to meet my eye.\nSeeing their reaction shook me, and I made an effort to get a grip on myself. I drew a deep breath and closed my eyes. The moment of strange disorientation passed, though my boots still felt hard and heavy on my feet.\nWhen I opened my eyes again, I saw Hespe looking up at me. She spoke hesitantly. \u201cKvothe,\u201d she said hesitantly. \u201cYou look . . . well.\u201d\nI smiled wide. \u201cI am.\u201d\n\u201cWe thought you were . . . lost.\u201d\n\u201cYou thought I was gone,\u201d I corrected gently as I made my way to the\nfireplace where Marten stood. \u201cDead in Felurian\u2019s arms or wandering the forest, mad and broken with desire.\u201d I looked at them each in turn. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right?\u201d\nI felt the whole room\u2019s eyes on me and decided to make the most of the situation. \u201cCome now, I am Kvothe. I am Edema Ruh born. I have studied at the University and can call down lightning like Taborlin the Great. Did you really think Felurian would be the death of me?\u201d\n\u201cShe would be,\u201d said a rough voice from the edge of the hearth. \u201cIf you had ever so much as seen her shadow.\u201d\nI turned to see the hawk-faced fiddler. \u201cI beg your pardon, sir?\u201d\n\u201cYou should beg the pardon of everyone here,\u201d he said, his voice dripping with disdain. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you hope to gain from this, but I don\u2019t believe the lot of you saw Felurian, not for a second.\u201d\nI met his eyes. \u201cI did more than see her, friend.\u201d\n\u201cIf that were true, then you\u2019d be mad now, or dead. And while I\u2019ll admit you might be mad, it\u2019s not from any faerie charm.\u201d The room chuckled at this. \u201cNo one has seen her in a score of years. The fair folk have left this place behind, and you\u2019re no Taborlin, no matter what your friends say. I\u2019m guessin\u2019 you\u2019re just a clever storyteller hopin\u2019 to make a name for himself.\u201d\nThat struck uncomfortably close to the mark, and I could see some of the crowd eyeing me skeptically.\nBefore I could say anything Dedan burst in. \u201cWhat about his beard then? When he ran off three nights ago his face was smooth as a baby\u2019s ass.\u201d\n\u201cSo you say,\u201d the fiddler replied. \u201cI was going to keep quiet even though I didn\u2019t believe half what you told us about those bandits or him calling the", "lightning. But I thought to myself, \u2018Their friend probably died and they want folks to remember him with a proud story or two.\u2019 \u201d\nHe looked down his broken nose to where Dedan sat. \u201cBut really, this has gone too far. It\u2019s not wise to tell lies about the fair folk. I don\u2019t appreciate strangers coming here and spinning my friends\u2019 heads full of nonsense. Be quiet, the lot of you. We\u2019ve heard enough out of you tonight.\u201d\nHaving said his piece, the fiddler opened the battered case that sat next to him and drew out his instrument. The mood of the room had grown vaguely hostile by this point, and more than a few people eyed me resentfully.\nDedan sputtered angrily. \u201cNow listen h\u2014\u201d Hespe said something and tried to pull him down into his seat, but Dedan shook her off. \u201cNo. I won\u2019t be called a liar. We were sent here by Alveron himself because of them bandits. And we did our job. We\u2019re not expecting a parade, but I\u2019ll be damned before I let you call me a liar. We killed those bastards. And afterward we did see Felurian. And Kvothe there did take off after her.\u201d\nDedan glared around the room belligerently, mostly in the direction of the fiddler. \u201cThat\u2019s the truth and I swear it by my good right hand. If anyone wants to call me a liar we can have it out right now.\u201d\nThe fiddler picked up his bow and met Dedan\u2019s eye. He drew a screaming note across the strings. \u201cLiar.\u201d\nDedan nearly leapt across the room as people pushed their chairs back to make a clear space for the fight. The fiddler came to his feet slowly. He was taller than I\u2019d expected, with short grey hair and scarred knuckles that told me he knew his way around a fistfight.\nI managed to get in front of Dedan and leaned against him, speaking low in his ear, \u201cDo you really want to brawl with a broken arm? If he gets hold of it, you\u2019ll just scream and piss yourself in front of Hespe.\u201d I felt him relax a bit and gave him a gentle push back toward his seat. He went, but he wasn\u2019t happy.\n\u201c... something here.\u201d I heard a woman say behind me. \u201cIf you want to have a scuff with someone you take it outside and don\u2019t bother coming back. You don\u2019t get paid to fight the customers. You hear?\u201d\n\u201cNow Penny,\u201d the fiddler said soothingly. \u201cI was just showin\u2019 some teeth to him. He\u2019s the one took it all personal. You can\u2019t blame me for makin\u2019 fun with the sort of stories they come in with.\u201d\nI turned around and saw the fiddler explaining himself to an angry woman in her middle years. She was a full foot shorter than him, and had to reach up", "to jab his chest with a finger.\nThat\u2019s when I heard a voice exclaim to one side of me, \u201cGod\u2019s mother,\nSeb. You see that? Look at it! It\u2019s movin\u2019 by itself.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re blind drunk. It\u2019s just a breeze.\u201d\n\u201cThere ain\u2019t no wind in tonight. It\u2019s moving itself. Look again!\u201d\nIt was my shaed, of course. By now several people had noticed it blowing\ngently in a breeze that wasn\u2019t there. I thought the effect was rather nice, but I could tell by their wide eyes that folk were becoming alarmed. One or two slid their chairs away from me uneasily.\nPenny\u2019s eyes were fixed on my gently flowing shaed, and she walked over to stand in front of me. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked, her voice showing just a hint of fear.\n\u201cNothing to worry over,\u201d I said easily, holding out a fold of it for her inspection. \u201cIt is my shadow cloak. Felurian made it for me.\u201d\nThe fiddler made a disgusted noise.\nPenny shot him a look and hesitantly brushed my cloak with a hand. \u201cIt\u2019s soft,\u201d she murmured, looking up at me. When our eyes met she looked surprised for a moment, then exclaimed, \u201cYou\u2019re Losi\u2019s boy!\u201d\nBefore I could ask what she meant, I heard a woman\u2019s voice say, \u201cWhat?\u201d I turned to see a red-haired serving girl moving toward us. The same one who had embarrassed me so badly on our first visit to the Pennysworth.\nPenny nodded toward me. \u201cIt\u2019s your fresh-faced fiery boy from about three span back! You remember pointing him out to me? I didn\u2019t recognize him with the beard.\u201d\nLosi came to stand in front of me. Bright red curls tumbled over the bare, pale skin of her shoulders. Her dangerous green eyes swept over my shaed and made their slow way up to my face. \u201cIt\u2019s him all right,\u201d she said sideways to Penny. \u201cBeard or no.\u201d\nShe took a step closer, almost pressing against me. \u201cBoys are always wearing beards and hoping it will make them men.\u201d Her bright emerald eyes settled boldly onto mine as if expecting me to blush and fumble about as I had before.\nI thought of everything I\u2019d learned at the hands of Felurian, and felt the strange, wild laughter welling up in me again. I fought it down as best I could, but I could feel it tumbling around inside me as I met her eye and smiled.\nLosi took a startled half-step back, her pale skin blushing to a furious red.", "Penny held out a hand to steady her. \u201cLord girl, what\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d\nLosi tore her eyes away from me. \u201cLook at him Penny, really look at him. He\u2019s got a fae look about him. Look at his eyes.\u201d\nPenny looked curiously at my face, then flushed a bit herself and crossed her arms in front of her chest, as if I had seen her naked. \u201cMerciful lord,\u201d she said breathlessly. \u201cIt\u2019s all true, then. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cEvery word,\u201d I said.\n\u201cHow did you get away from her?\u201d Penny asked.\n\u201cOh come on, Penny!\u201d the fiddler cried out in disbelief. \u201cYou aren\u2019t buyin\u2019\nthis pup\u2019s story, are ya?\u201d\nLosi turned and spoke hotly. \u201cThere\u2019s a look a man has when he knows his\nway around a woman, Ben Crayton. Not that you would know. When this one was here a couple span ago I liked his face and thought I\u2019d have a roll with him. But when I tried to trip him . . .\u201d She trailed off, seemingly at a loss for words.\n\u201cI remember that,\u201d a man at the bar called out. \u201cFunniest damn thing. I thought he was gonna piss himself. He couldn\u2019t say a word to her.\u201d\nThe fiddler shrugged. \u201cSo he found some farmer\u2019s daughter since then. It don\u2019t mean . . .\u201d\n\u201cHush Ben,\u201d Penny said with quiet authority. \u201cThere\u2019s more changed here than a bit of beard can account for.\u201d Her eyes searched my face. \u201cLord but you\u2019re right, girl. There is a fae look about him.\u201d The fiddler started to speak again but Penny shot him a sharp look. \u201cHush or get out. I don\u2019t want any fights in here tonight.\u201d\nThe fiddler looked around the room and saw the tide had turned against him. Red-faced and scowling, he gathered up his fiddle and stormed out.\nLosi stepped close to me again, brushing her hair back. \u201cWas she really as beautiful as they say?\u201d Her chin went up proudly. \u201cMore beautiful than me?\u201d\nI hesitated, then spoke softly. \u201cShe was Felurian, most beautiful of all.\u201d I reached out to brush the side of her neck where her red hair began its curling tumble downward, then leaned forward and whispered seven words into her ear. \u201cFor all that, she lacked your fire.\u201d And she loved me for those seven words, and her pride was safe.\nPenny spoke up. \u201cHow did you manage to get away?\u201d\nI looked around the room and felt everyone\u2019s attention settle onto me. The wild, fae laughter tumbled around inside me. I smiled a lazy smile. My shaed", "billowed.\nThen I moved to the front of the room, sat on the hearth, and told them the\nstory.\nOr rather, I told them a story. If I\u2019d told them the entire truth they wouldn\u2019t\nhave believed it. Felurian let me go because I was holding a song hostage? It simply didn\u2019t fit the classic lines.\nSo what I told them was closer to the story they expected to hear. In that story, I chased Felurian into the Fae. Our bodies tangled together in her twilight glade. Then, as we rested, I played her music light enough to make her laugh, music dark enough to make her gasp, music sweet enough to make her weep.\nBut when I tried to leave the Fae, she would not let me. She was too fond of my . . . artistry.\nI shouldn\u2019t be coy, I suppose. I implied rather strongly that Felurian thought quite highly of me as a lover. I offer no apology for this behavior except to say that I was a young man of sixteen, proud of my newfound skills, and not above a little bragging.\nI told them how Felurian had tried to trap me in the Fae, how we fought with magic. For this I borrowed a little from Taborlin the Great. There was fire and lightning.\nAt the end I bested Felurian but spared her life. In her gratitude she wove me a faerie cloak, taught me secret magics, and gave me a silver leaf as a token of her favor. The leaf was pure fabrication, of course. But it wouldn\u2019t have been a proper story if she hadn\u2019t given me three gifts.\nAll in all, it was a good story. And if it wasn\u2019t entirely true . . . well, at least it had some truth mixed in. In my defense, I could have dispensed with the truth entirely and told a much better story. Lies are simpler, and most of the time they make better sense.\nLosi watched me all through the telling, and seemed to take the whole thing as something of a challenge to the prowess of mortal women. After the story was over, she laid claim to me and led me to her small room on the topmost floor of the Pennysworth.\nI managed very little sleep that night, and Losi came closer to killing me than Felurian ever had. She was a delightful partner, every bit as wonderful as Felurian had been.\nBut how could that be? I hear you ask. How could any mortal woman compare with Felurian?", "It is easier to understand if you think of it in terms of music. Sometimes a man enjoys a symphony. Elsetimes he finds a jig more suited to his taste. The same holds true for lovemaking. One type is suited to the deep cushions of a twilight forest glade. Another comes quite naturally tangled in the sheets of narrow beds upstairs in inns. Each woman is like an instrument, waiting to be learned, loved, and finely played, to have at last her own true music made.\nSome might take offense at this way of seeing things, not understanding how a trouper views his music. They might think I degrade women. They might consider me callous, or boorish, or crude.\nBut those people do not understand love, or music, or me.", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED EIGHT": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED EIGHT\nQuick\nWE SPENT A FEW days at the Pennysworth while our welcome was warm. We had our own rooms and all our meals for free. Fewer bandits meant safer roads and more customers, and Penny knew our presence at the inn would draw a better crowd than fiddle playing any night.\nWe put the time to good use, enjoying hot meals and soft beds. All of us could use the time to mend. Hespe was still nursing her arrow-shot leg, Dedan his broken arm. My own minor injuries from the fight with the bandits were long since gone, but I had newer ones, mostly consisting of a heavily scratched back.\nI taught Tempi the basics of the lute, and he resumed teaching me how to fight. My training consisted of short, terse discussions concerning the Lethani and long, strenuous periods of practicing the Ketan.\nI also pieced together a song about my Felurian experience. I originally called it \u201cIn Twilight Versed,\u201d which you have to admit wasn\u2019t a very good title. Luckily, the name didn\u2019t stick and these days most folk know it as \u201cThe Song Half-Sung.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t my best work, but it was easy to remember. The customers at the inn seemed to enjoy it, and when I heard Losi whistling it as she served drinks, I knew it would spread like a fire in a seam of coal.\nSince folk kept asking for stories, I shared a few other interesting events from my life. I told them how I\u2019d managed to get admitted into the University when I was barely fifteen years old. I told them how I\u2019d gained entry to the Arcanum in a mere three days\u2019 time. I told them how I had called the name of the wind in a furious rage after Ambrose broke my lute.\nUnfortunately, by the third night, I was out of true stories. And, since my audience was still hungry for more, I simply stole a story about Illien and put myself in his place instead, stealing a few pieces from Taborlin while I was at it.\nI\u2019m not proud of that, and in my defense, I\u2019d like to say I\u2019d had quite a bit", "to drink. What\u2019s more, there were a few pretty women in my audience. There is something powerfully beguiling about the excited eyes of a young woman. They can pull all manner of nonsense out of a foolish young man, and I was no exception to this rule.\nMeanwhile, Dedan and Hespe occupied the small exclusive world new lovers make for themselves. They were a delight to watch. Dedan was gentler, quieter. Hespe\u2019s face lost much of its hardness. They spent a great deal of time in their room. Catching up on their sleep, no doubt.\nMarten flirted outrageously with Penny, drank enough to drown a fish, and generally enjoyed himself enough for any three men.\nWe left the Pennysworth after three days, not wanting to wear our welcome thin. I for one was glad to go. Between Tempi\u2019s training and Losi\u2019s attentions I was nearly dead from exhaustion.\nWe made slow time on the road back to Severen. Part of this was out of concern for Hespe\u2019s injured leg, but some of it was because we knew our time together was drawing to an end. Despite our difficulties, we had become close, and it is hard to leave such things behind.\nNews of our adventures had run ahead of us on the road. So when we stopped for the night our meals and beds were easy to come by, if not free.\nOn our third day out of the Pennysworth, we ran across a small troupe of performers. They weren\u2019t Edema Ruh and looked rather out at the heels. There were just four of them: an older fellow, two men in their twenties, and a boy of eight or nine. They were packing up their rickety cart just as we were stopping to give Hespe\u2019s leg a bit of a rest.\n\u201cHello the troupers,\u201d I called out.\nThey looked up nervously, then relaxed as they saw the lute across my back. \u201cHello the bard.\u201d\nI laughed and shook their hands. \u201cNo bard here, just a bit of a singer.\u201d\n\u201cHello the same,\u201d the older man said, smiling. \u201cWhich way are you heading?\u201d\n\u201cNorth to south. Yourself?\u201d\nThey relaxed further once they knew I was heading in a different direction. \u201cEast to west,\u201d he said.\n \n\u201cHow\u2019s your luck been?\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cPoor enough lately. But we\u2019ve heard tell of a Lady Chalker who lives two days off. They say she never turns a man away if he can fiddle a bit or mum a play. We hope to come off with a penny or two.\u201d\n\u201cThings were better when we had the bear,\u201d one of the younger men said. \u201cFolk\u2019ll pay to see a bear-bait.\u201d\n\u201cWent sick of a dog bite,\u201d the other man explained to me. \u201cDied near a year ago.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a shame,\u201d I said. \u201cBear\u2019s hard to come by.\u201d They nodded a silent agreement. \u201cI\u2019ve got a new song for you. What will you trade me for it?\u201d\nHe eyed me warily. \u201cWell now, new to you isn\u2019t exactly new to us,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cAnd a new song ain\u2019t necessarily a good song, if you know what I mean.\u201d\n\u201cJudge for yourself,\u201d I said as I uncased my lute. I\u2019d written it to be easy to remember and simple to sing, but I still had to repeat it twice before he caught all of it. As I\u2019ve said, they weren\u2019t Edema Ruh.\n\u201cA good enough song,\u201d he admitted grudgingly. \u201cEveryone likes Felurian, but I don\u2019t know what we can trade you for it.\u201d\nThe young boy piped up, \u201cI made up a verse to \u2018Tinker Tanner.\u2019 \u201d The others tried to hush him, but I smiled. \u201cI\u2019d love to hear it.\u201d The boy puffed himself up and sang out in a piping voice:\nI once saw a fair farmer\u2019s daughter On the riverbank far from all men She was taking a bath when I saw her Said she didn\u2019t feel right\nIf a man caught a sight\nSo she soaped herself slowly all over again.\nI laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d I complimented him, \u201cBut how about this?\nI once saw a fair farmer\u2019s daughter\nOn the riverbank far from all men.\nShe confessed to me once when I caught her That she didn\u2019t feel clean\nIf her bathing was seen\nSo she washed herself over again.", "The boy thought about it. \u201cI like mine better,\u201d he said after a moment\u2019s consideration.\nI patted him on the back. \u201cIt\u2019s a good man that sticks to his own verse.\u201d I turned back to the leader of the little troupe. \u201cAny gossip?\u201d\nHe thought for a moment. \u201cBandits north of here in the Eld.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cThey\u2019ve been cleared out now, so I\u2019ve heard.\u201d\nHe thought some more. \u201cI heard Alveron\u2019s getting married to the Lackless\nwoman.\u201d\n\u201cI know a poem about Lackless!\u201d The young boy chimed in again, and\nbegan:\nSeven things stand before\nThe entrance to the Lackless door\u2014\n\u201cHush.\u201d The older man cuffed the boy gently along side of his head. He looked up apologetically. \u201cBoy\u2019s got a good ear, but not one lick of manners.\u201d\n\u201cActually,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019d like to hear it.\u201d\nHe shrugged and let go of the boy, who glared at him before reciting:\nSeven things stand before\nThe entrance to the Lackless door.\nOne of them a ring unworn\nOne a word that is forsworn\nOne a time that must be right\nOne a candle without light\nOne a son who brings the blood\nOne a door that holds the flood\nOne a thing tight-held in keeping\nThen comes that which comes with sleeping.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those riddle rhymes,\u201d the father said apologetically. \u201cLord knows where he hears them, but he knows better than to go spouting every lewd thing he hears.\u201d\n\u201cWhere did you hear it?\u201d I asked.\nThe boy thought for a moment, then shrugged and began to scratch himself behind his knee. \u201cDunno. Kids.\u201d", "\u201cWe should be getting on,\u201d the older man said, looking up at the sky. I dug into my purse, and handed him a silver noble. \u201cWhat\u2019s this then?\u201d he asked, eyeing it suspiciously.\n\u201cTo help with a new bear,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve been through some tight times too, but I\u2019m flush now.\u201d\nThey left after thanking me profusely. Poor fellows. No self-respecting Ruh troupe would ever stoop to bearbaiting. There was no skill involved, no pride in the performance.\nBut they could hardly be blamed for the their lack of Ruh blood, and we troupers have to watch out for each other. No one else does.\nTempi and I used our walking hours to discuss the Lethani and evenings to practice the Ketan. It was becoming easier for me, and I could sometimes make it as far as Catching Rain before Tempi caught some minuscule mistake and made me start over.\nThe two of us had found a halfway secluded place beside the inn where we had stopped for the day. Dedan, Hespe, and Marten were inside drinking. I worked my way carefully through the Ketan while Tempi sat with his back to a tree, practicing a basic fingering drill I had taught him with relentless determination. Over and over. Over and over.\nI had just made it through Circling Hands when I caught a flicker of movement from the corner of my eye. I did not pause, as Tempi had taught me to avoid distraction while performing the Ketan. If I turned to look I would have to start over again.\nMoving with painful slowness I began Dance Backwards. But as soon as I placed my heel, I could tell my balance was wrong. I waited for Tempi to call out, but he didn\u2019t.\nI stopped the Ketan and turned to see a group of four Adem mercenaries walking toward us with a prowling grace. Tempi was already on his feet and walking toward them. My lute was back in its case and leaning up against the side of the tree.\nSoon the five of them were standing in a tight group, close enough that their shoulders almost touched. Close enough that I couldn\u2019t hear the barest whisper of what they were saying or even see their hands. But I could tell\n \nfrom the angle of Tempi\u2019s shoulders that he was uncomfortable, defensive. I knew calling out to Tempi would be considered rude, so I walked over.\nBut before I came close enough to hear, one of the unfamiliar mercenaries stretched out a hand and pushed me away, his spread fingers pressing firmly against the center of my chest.\nWithout thinking, I made Break Lion, taking hold of his thumb and turning his wrist away from me. He loosed his hand from mine without any apparent effort and moved to trip me with Chasing Stone. I made Dance Backwards and got the balance right this time, but his other hand struck me in the temple just enough to dizzy me for half a second, not hard enough to even hurt.\nMy pride stung though. It was the same way Tempi struck me in silent rebuke for sloppy performance of the Ketan.\n\u201cQuick,\u201d the mercenary said softly in Aturan. It was only when I heard her voice that I realized she was a woman. Not that she was particularly masculine, it was simply that she seemed so similar to Tempi. She had the same sandy hair, pale grey eyes, calm expression, blood-red clothes. She was taller than Tempi by a few inches, and her shoulders were broader than his. But while she was whipcord thin, the tightness of her mercenary reds still revealed the lean curves of hip and breast.\nLooking more closely, I could easily see three of the four mercenaries were women. The broad-shouldered one facing me had a thin scar cutting through her eyebrow and another close to her jaw. They were the same pale silver scars Tempi had on his arms and chest. And while they were far from gruesome, they made her expressionless face look oddly grim.\n\u201cQuick\u201d she had said. On the surface it seemed to be a compliment, but I\u2019ve been mocked enough in my life to recognize it, regardless of the language.\nEven worse, her right hand slid all the way around to rest in the small of her back, palm facing out. Even with my rudimentary knowledge of Adem hand-talk I knew what that meant. Her hand was as far as it could possibly get from the hilt of her sword. At the same time, she turned her shoulder to me and looked away. I wasn\u2019t just being declared unthreatening, this was insultingly dismissive.\nI fought to keep my face calm, guessing any expression would only further lower her opinion of me.\nTempi pointed back where I had come from. \u201cGo,\u201d he said. Serious. Formal.", "I reluctantly obeyed, not wanting to make a scene.\nThe Adem stood in a close knot a quarter hour as I practiced the Ketan. Though I didn\u2019t hear a whisper of their conversation, it was obvious they were arguing. Their gestures were sharp and angry, the placement of their feet aggressive.\nEventually the four unfamiliar Adem left, walking back toward the road. Tempi returned to where I was trying to work my way through Threshing Wheat.\n\u201cToo wide.\u201d Irritation. He tapped my back leg and pushed my shoulder to show my balance was lacking.\nI moved my foot and tried again. \u201cWho were they, Tempi?\u201d\n\u201cAdem,\u201d he said simply, sitting himself back down at the foot of the tree. \u201cDid you know them?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Tempi looked around, then brought my lute out of its case. With his\nhands occupied, he was doubly mute. I went back to practicing the Ketan, knowing that trying to pry answers out of him would be like pulling teeth.\nTwo hours passed, and the sun began to sink behind the western trees. \u201cTomorrow I leave,\u201d he said. With both his hands still on the lute, I could only guess at his mood.\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\u201cTo Haert. To Shehyn.\u201d\n\u201cAre those cities?\u201d\n\u201cHaert is city. Shehyn is my teacher.\u201d\nI had given some thought to what might be the matter. \u201cAre you in trouble\nfor teaching me?\u201d\nHe set the lute back in the case and pressed the lid back in place.\n\u201cPerhaps.\u201d Yes.\n\u201cIs it forbidden?\u201d\n\u201cIt is most forbidden,\u201d he said.\nTempi stood and began the Ketan. I followed him, and both of us were\nquiet for a while.\n\u201cHow much trouble?\u201d I asked eventually.\n\u201cMost trouble,\u201d he said, and I heard an uncharacteristic shred of emotion in\nhis voice, anxiety. \u201cIt was perhaps unwise.\u201d\nTogether we moved as slowly as the setting sun.\nI thought of what the Cthaeh had said. The one shred of potentially useful\ninformation it had let slip in our conversation. You laughed at faeries until", "you saw one. Small wonder all your civilized neighbors dismiss the Chandrian as well. You\u2019d have to leave your precious corners far behind before you found someone who might take you seriously. You wouldn\u2019t have a hope until you made it to the Stormwal.\nFelurian had said the Cthaeh only spoke the truth.\n\u201cCould I accompany you?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cAccompany?\u201d Tempi asked, his hands moving in a graceful circle\nintended to break the long bones of the arm. \u201cTravel with. Follow. To Haert.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWould it help your trouble?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cI will come.\u201d \u201cI thank you.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED NINE": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED NINE\nBarbarians and Madmen\nTRUTHFULLY, I WANTED NOTHING more than to make my way back to Severen. I wanted to sleep in a bed again and take advantage of the Maer\u2019s favor while it was still fresh in his mind. I wanted to find Denna and make things right between us.\nBut Tempi was in trouble for teaching me. I couldn\u2019t simply run off and leave him to face that by himself. What\u2019s more, the Cthaeh had told me Denna had already left Severen behind. Though I hardly needed a prophetic faerie to tell me that. I\u2019d been gone for a month, and Denna was never the sort to let grass grow under her feet.\nSo the next morning our group parted ways. Dedan, Hespe, and Marten were going south to Severen to report to the Maer and collect their pay. Tempi and I were heading northeast toward the Stormwal and Ademre.\n\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want me to take him the box?\u201d Dedan asked for the fifth time.\n\u201cI promised the Maer I\u2019d return any monies to him personally,\u201d I lied. \u201cBut I do need you to give him this.\u201d I handed the big mercenary the letter I\u2019d written the night before. \u201cIt explains why I had to make you the leader of the group.\u201d I grinned. \u201cYou might get a bonus out of it.\u201d\nDedan puffed up importantly as he took hold of the letter.\nStanding nearby, Marten made a noise that could have been a cough.\nAs Tempi and I traveled, I managed to coax a few details from the mercenary. Eventually I learned it was customary for someone of his social standing to gain permission before he took a student of his own.\nComplicating matters was the fact that I was an outsider. A barbarian. In teaching a person like me, it seems like Tempi had done more than violate a\n \ncustom. He had broken a trust with his teacher and his people.\n\u201cWill there be a trial of some sort?\u201d I asked.\nHe shook his head. \u201cNo trial. Shehyn will ask me questions. I will say, \u2018I\nsaw in Kvothe good iron waiting. He is of Lethani. He needs Lethani to guide him.\u2019 \u201d\nTempi nodded at me. \u201cShehyn will ask you of the Lethani to see if I were right in my seeing. Shehyn will decide if you are iron worth striking.\u201d His hand circled, making the gesture for uneasy.\n\u201cAnd what will happen if I am not?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cFor you?\u201d Uncertainty. \u201cFor me? I will be cut away.\u201d\n\u201cCut away?\u201d I asked, hoping I misunderstood.\nHe held up a hand and wiggled his fingers. \u201cAdem.\u201d He made a tight fist\nand shook it. \u201cAdemre.\u201d Then he opened his hand and touched his little finger. \u201cTempi.\u201d He touched the other fingers. \u201cFriend. Brother. Mother.\u201d He touched the thumb. \u201cShehyn.\u201d Then he made a gesture as if paring off his little finger and throwing it away. \u201cCut away,\u201d he said.\nNot killed then, but exiled. I started to breathe easier until I looked in Tempi\u2019s pale eyes. For just a moment there was a crack in his perfect, placid mask, and behind it I saw the truth. Death would be a kinder punishment than being cut away. He was terrified, as frightened as anyone I had ever seen.\nWe agreed our best hope was for me to put myself entirely in Tempi\u2019s hands during the trip to Haert. I had approximately fifteen days to polish what I knew to a bright shine. The hope being that when I met Tempi\u2019s superiors, I could make a good impression.\nBefore we began that first day, Tempi instructed me to put my shaed away. Reluctantly, I did so. It folded down into a surprisingly small bundle that stowed easily into my travelsack.\nThe pace Tempi set was grueling. First the two of us moved through the dancer\u2019s stretch I had watched many times before. Then, instead of our usual brisk walk, we ran for an hour. Then we performed the Ketan with Tempi correcting my endless mistakes. Then we walked a mile.\nFinally, we sat and discussed the Lethani. The fact that these discussions were in Ademic did not make matters easier, but we agreed I should immerse\n \nmyself in the language so when I reached Haert I could speak as a civilized person.\n\u201cWhat is the purpose of the Lethani?\u201d Tempi asked. \u201cTo give us a path to follow?\u201d I replied.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tempi said sternly. \u201cThe Lethani is not a path.\u201d \u201cWhat is the purpose of the Lethani, Tempi?\u201d\n\u201cTo guide us in our actions. By following the Lethani, you act rightly.\u201d \u201cIs this not a path?\u201d\n\u201cNo. The Lethani is what helps us choose a path.\u201d\nThen we would begin the cycle again. Run an hour, perform the Ketan,\nwalk a mile, discuss the Lethani. It took about two hours, and after our brief discussion was finished, we began again.\nAt one point in our discussion of the Lethani I began to make the gesture for understatement. But Tempi lay his hand on top of mine, stopping me.\n\u201cWhen we are having talk about the Lethani, you are to make none of this.\u201d His left hand moved quickly through excitement, negation, and several others gestures I didn\u2019t recognize.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nTempi thought for a moment. \u201cWhen you speak of Lethani, it should not come from here,\u201d he tapped on my head. \u201cOr here.\u201d He tapped on my chest over my heart and ran his fingers down to my left hand. \u201cTrue knowing of the Lethani lives deeper. Lives here.\u201d He prodded me in the stomach, below my navel. \u201cYou must speak from here, without thinking.\u201d\nAs we continued, I slowly came to understand the unspoken rules to our discussions. Not only was it intended to teach me the Lethani, it was supposed to reveal how deeply rooted understanding of the Lethani had become within me.\nThat meant questions were to be answered quickly, with none of the deliberate pauses that usually marked Ademic conversation. You were not supposed to give a thoughtful answer, you were supposed to give an earnest one. If you truly understood the Lethani, that knowledge would become obvious in your answers.\nRun. Ketan. Walk. Discuss. We completed the cycle three times before our midday break. Six hours. I was covered in sweat and half-convinced I would die. After an hour to rest and eat, we were off again. We finished another three cycles before we stopped for the night.\nWe made camp by the side of the road. I chewed my supper half-asleep,", "spread my blanket, and wrapped myself in my shaed. In my exhausted state it seemed soft and warm as a down eider.\nIn the middle of the night, Tempi shook me awake. Though some deep animal part of me hated him, I knew it was necessary as soon as I stirred. My body was stiff and aching, but the slow, familiar movements of the Ketan helped loosen my tight muscles. He made me stretch and drink water, then I slept like a stone for the remainder of the night.\nThe second day was worse. Even strapped tightly to my back, my lute became a miserable burden. The sword I couldn\u2019t even use dragged at my hip. My travelsack felt heavy as a millstone, and I regretted not letting Dedan take the Maer\u2019s box. My muscles were rubbery and disloyal, and when we ran my breath burned in my throat.\nThe moments when Tempi and I spoke of Lethani were the only real rest, but they were disappointingly brief. My mind spun with exhaustion, and it took all my concentration to pull my thoughts into order, trying to give proper answers. Even so, my responses only irritated him. Time after time he shook his head, explaining how I was wrong.\nEventually I gave up trying to be right. Too weary to care, I quit pulling my exhausted thoughts into order, and simply enjoyed sitting down for a few minutes. I was too weary to remember what I said half the time, but, surprisingly, Tempi found those answers more to his liking. That was a blessing. When my answers pleased him, our discussions lasted longer, and I could spend more time resting.\nI felt considerably better the third day. My muscles no longer ached as badly. My breath came easier. My head felt clear and light, like a leaf floating on the wind. In this frame of mind, answers to Tempi\u2019s questions tripped easily off the tip of my tongue, simple as singing.\nRun. Ketan. Walk. Discuss. Three cycles. Then, as we moved through the Ketan on the side of the road, I collapsed.\nTempi had been watching closely and caught me before I hit the ground. My world spun dizzily for a few minutes before I realized I was in the shade of a tree at the side of the road. Tempi must have carried me there.\nHe held out my waterskin. \u201cDrink.\u201d\nThe thought of water was not appealing, but I took a mouthful anyway. \u201cI am sorry, Tempi.\u201d\nHe shook his head. \u201cYou came far before falling. You did not complain. You showed your mind is stronger than your body. That is good. When the", "mind controls the body, that is of the Lethani. But knowing your limit is also of the Lethani. It is better to stop when you must than run until you fall.\u201d\n\u201cUnless falling is what the Lethani requires,\u201d I said without thinking. My head still felt light as a windblown leaf.\nHe gave me a rare smile. \u201cYes. You are beginning to see.\u201d\nI returned his smile. \u201cYour Aturan is coming very well, Tempi.\u201d Tempi blinked. Worry. \u201cWe are speaking my language, not yours.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not speaking ...\u201d I started to protest, but as I did I listened to the\nwords I was using. Sceopa teyas. My head reeled for a moment.\n\u201cDrink again,\u201d Tempi said, and though his face and voice were carefully\ncontrolled, I could tell he was concerned.\nI took another sip to pacify him. Then, as if my body suddenly realized it\nneeded the water, I became very thirsty and took several large swallows. I stopped before I drank too much and cramped my stomach. Tempi nodded, approval.\n\u201cAm I speaking well then?\u201d I said to distract myself from my thirst.\n\u201cYou are speaking well for a child. Very well for a barbarian.\u201d\n\u201cOnly well? Am I making the words wrong?\u201d\n\u201cYou touch eyes too much.\u201d He widened his eyes and stared pointedly into\nmy own, unblinking. \u201cAlso, your words are good, but simple.\u201d\n\u201cYou must teach me more words then.\u201d\nHe shook his head. Serious. \u201cYou already know too many words.\u201d \u201cToo many? Tempi, I know very few.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not the words, it is their use. In Adem there is an art to speaking.\nThere are those who can say many things in one thing. My Shehyn is such. They say a thing in one breath and others will find meaning in it for a year.\u201d Gentle reproach. \u201cToo often you say more than you need. You should not speak in Ademic as you sing in Aturan. A hundred words to praise a woman. Too many. Our talk is smaller.\u201d\n\u201cSo when I meet a woman, I should simply say, \u2018You are beautiful?\u2019 \u201d\nTempi shook his head. \u201cNo. You would say simply \u2018beautiful,\u2019 and let the woman decide the rest of what you mean.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that . . .\u201d I didn\u2019t know the words for \u201cvague\u201d or \u201cunspecific\u201d and had to start again to get my point across. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that lead to confusion?\u201d\n\u201cIt leads to thoughtfulness,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cIt is delicate. That should always be the concern when one is speaking. To be too much talking.\u201d He shook his head. Disapproval. \u201cIt is . . .\u201d He stalled, searching for a word.", "\u201cRude?\u201d\nNegation. Frustration. \u201cI go to Severen, and there are people who stink. There are people who do not. Both are people, but those who do not stink are people of quality.\u201d He tapped my chest firmly with two fingers. \u201cYou are not a goatherd. You are a student of the Lethani. My student. You should speak as a person of quality.\u201d\n\u201cBut what about clarity? What if you were building a bridge? There are many pieces to that. All of them must be said clearly.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Tempi said. Agreement. \u201cSometimes. But in most things, important things, delicate is better. Small is better.\u201d\nTempi reached out and gripped my shoulder firmly. Then he looked up, met my eye and held it for a brief moment. Such a rarity for him. He gave a small, quiet smile.\n\u201cProud,\u201d he said.\nThe remainder of the day was spent in recovery. We would walk a few miles, perform the Ketan, discuss the Lethani, then walk again. We stopped at a roadside inn that evening where I ate enough for three men and fell into bed before the sun had left the sky.\nThe next day we went back to the cycles, but only two before midday and two after. My body burned and ached, but I was no longer delirious with exhaustion. Fortunately, with a little mental effort, I could slide back into that strange anticipatory clear-headedness I\u2019d used to answer Tempi\u2019s questions the day before.\nOver the next couple of days I came to think of that odd mental state as Spinning Leaf.\nIt seemed like a distant cousin to Heart of Stone, the mental exercise I\u2019d learned so long ago. That said, there was little similarity between the two. Heart of Stone was practical: it stripped away emotion and focused my mind. It made it easier to break my mind into separate pieces or maintain the all- important Alar.\nOn the other hand, Spinning Leaf seemed largely useless. It was relaxing to let my mind grow clear and empty, then float and tumble lightly from one thing to the next. But aside from helping me draw answers to Tempi\u2019s\n \nquestions out of thin air, it seemed to have no practical value. It was the mental equivalent of a card trick.\nBy the eighth day on the road, my body no longer ached constantly. That was when Tempi added something new. After performing the Ketan the two of us would fight. It was hard, as that was when I was the most weary. But after the fighting we would always sit, rest, and discuss the Lethani.\n\u201cWhy did you smile as we fought today?\u201d Tempi would say. \u201cBecause I was happy.\u201d\n\u201cDid you enjoy the fighting?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nTempi radiated displeasure. \u201cThat is not of the Lethani.\u201d\nI thought a moment on my next question. \u201cShould a man take pleasure in the fight?\u201d\n\u201cNo. You take pleasure in acting rightly and following the Lethani.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if following the Lethani requires me to fight? Should I not take pleasure in it?\u201d\n\u201cNo.You should take pleasure in following the Lethani. If you fight well, you should take pride in doing a thing well. For the fighting itself you should feel only duty and sorrow. Only barbarians and madmen take pleasure in combat. Whoever loves the fight itself has left the Lethani behind.\u201d\nOn the eleventh day, Tempi showed me how to incorporate my sword into the Ketan. The first thing I learned was how quickly a sword becomes lead- heavy when held at arm\u2019s length.\nWith our sparring and the addition of the sword, each cycle took nearly two and a half hours. Still we kept to our schedule every day. Three cycles before noon, three cycles after. Fifteen hours in all. I could feel my body hardening, becoming quick and lean like Tempi\u2019s.\nSo we ran, and I learned, and Haert drew ever closer.\n \n"], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TEN": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TEN\nBeauty and Branch\nAS WE TRAVELED, WE moved quickly through towns, stopping only for food and water. The countryside was a blur. My mind was focused on the Ketan, the Lethani, and the language I was learning.\nThe road became narrower as we made our way into the foothills of the Stormwal. The land grew rocky and jagged and the road began to snake back and forth as it avoided box valleys, bluffs, and jumbles of broken rock. The air changed, growing cooler than I expected in summer.\nWe finished the trip in fifteen days. At my best guess, we covered almost three hundred miles in that time.\nHaert was the first Adem town I\u2019d ever seen, and to my inexperienced eye it hardly seemed a town at all. There was no central street lined with houses and shops. What buildings I did see were widely spaced, oddly shaped, and built to fit closely with the natural shape of the land, as if they were trying to keep out of sight.\nI didn\u2019t know that the powerful storms that gave the mountain range its name were common here. Their sudden, changing winds would tear apart anything so upthrust and angular as the square timber houses common in the lands below.\nInstead the Adem built sensibly, hiding their buildings from the weather. Homes were built into the sides of hills, or outward from the leeward walls of sheltering cliffs. Some were dug downward. Others were carved into the stony sides of bluffs. Some you could hardly see unless you were standing next to them.\nThe exception was a group of low stone buildings clustered close together some distance from the road.\nWe stopped outside the largest of these. Tempi turned to face me, tugging nervously at the leather straps holding his mercenary reds tight to his arms. \u201cI must go and make my introductions to Shehyn. It may be some time.\u201d Anxiety. Regret. \u201cYou must wait here. Perhaps long.\u201d His body language told", "me more than his words. I cannot take you inside, as you are a barbarian. \u201cI will wait,\u201d I reassured him.\nHe nodded and went inside, glancing back at me before closing the door\nbehind himself.\nI looked around, watching a few people quietly going about their business:\na woman carrying a basket, a young boy leading a goat by a piece of rope. The buildings were made of the same rough stone as the landscape, blending into their surroundings. The sky was overcast, adding another shade of grey.\nThe wind blew over everything, snapping around corners and making patterns in the grass. I thought briefly of pulling on my shaed, but decided against it. The air was thinner here, and cooler. But it was still summer, and the sun was warm.\nIt felt oddly peaceful here, with none of the clamor and stink of a larger town. No clatter of hooves on cobblestones. No cart vendors singing out their wares. I could imagine someone like Tempi growing up in a place like this, soaking in the quiet until he was full of it, then taking it with him when he left.\nWith little else to look at, I turned to the nearby building. It was made from uneven pieces of stone pieced together like a jigsaw. Looking closer, I was puzzled by the lack of mortar. I tapped it with a knuckle, wondering briefly if it might be a single piece of stone carved to look like many stones fit together.\nBehind me, I heard a voice say in Ademic, \u201cWhat do you think of our wall?\u201d\nI turned to see an older woman with the characteristic pale grey eyes of the Adem. Her face was impassive, but her features were kind and motherly. She wore a yellow woolen cap pulled down over her ears. It was roughly knitted, and the sandy hair that stuck out from underneath was starting to go white. After all this time traveling with Tempi, it was odd to see an Adem who wasn\u2019t strapped into tight mercenary reds and wearing a sword. This woman wore a loose-fitting white shirt and linen pants.\n\u201cIs it fascinating, our wall?\u201d she asked, gesturing gentle amusement, curiosity with one hand. \u201cWhat do you think of it?\u201d\n\u201cI think it is beautiful,\u201d I responded in Ademic, careful to make only brief eye contact.\nHer hand tilted in an unfamiliar gesture. \u201cBeautiful?\u201d\nI gave the barest of shrugs. \u201cThere is beauty that belongs to simple things", "of function.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps you are mistaking a word,\u201d she said. Gentle apology. \u201cBeauty is a\nflower or a woman or a gem. Perhaps you mean to say \u2018utility.\u2019 A wall is useful.\u201d\n\u201cUseful, but beautiful as well.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps a thing gains beauty being used.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps a thing is used according to its beauty,\u201d I countered, wondering if\nthis was the Adem equivalent of small talk. If it was, I preferred it to the insipid gossip of the Maer\u2019s court.\n\u201cWhat of my hat?\u201d she asked, touching it with a hand. \u201cIs it beautiful because it is used?\u201d\nIt was knitted from a thick homespun wool and dyed a bright cornsilk yellow. It was slightly lopsided, and its stitching was uneven in places. \u201cIt seems very warm,\u201d I said carefully.\nShe gestured small amusement, and her eyes twinkled ever so slightly. \u201cIt is that,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd to me it is beautiful, as it was made for me by my daughter\u2019s daughter.\u201d\n\u201cThen it is beautiful as well.\u201d Agreement.\nThe woman hand-smiled at me. Her hand tilted differently than Tempi\u2019s when she made the gesture, and I decided to take it as a fond, motherly smile. Keeping my face blank, I gestured a smile in return, doing my best to make it both warm and polite.\n\u201cYou speak well for a barbarian,\u201d she said and reached out to grip my arms in a friendly gesture. \u201cVisitors are rare, especially those so courteous. Come with me and I will show you beauty, and you will speak to me of what its use might be.\u201d\nI looked down. Regret. \u201cI cannot. I am waiting.\u201d\n\u201cFor one inside?\u201d\nI nodded.\n\u201cIf they have gone inside, I suspect you will be waiting some time.\nCertainly they would be pleased if you came with me. I may prove more entertaining than a wall.\u201d The old woman lifted her arm and caught the attention of a young boy. He trotted over and looked up at her expectantly, his eyes darting briefly to my hair.\nShe made several gestures to the boy, but I only understood quietly. \u201cTell those inside I am taking this man for a walk so he need not stand alone in the wind. I will return him shortly.\u201d", "She tapped my lute case, then did the same to my travelsack and the sword on my hip. \u201cGive these to the boy and he will take them inside for you.\u201d\nWithout waiting for me to reply, she began to tug my travelsack off my shoulder, and I couldn\u2019t think of a graceful way of disengaging myself without seeming terribly impolite. Every culture is different, but one thing is always true: the surest way to give offense is to refuse the hospitality of your host.\nThe boy scurried off with my things and the old woman took my arm, leading me away. I resigned myself somewhat gratefully to her company, and we walked quietly until we came to a deep valley that opened suddenly in front of us. It was green, with a stream at the bottom, and sheltered from the persistent wind.\n\u201cWhat would you say of such a thing?\u201d she asked, gesturing to the hidden valley.\n\u201cIt is much like Ademre.\u201d\nShe patted my arm affectionately. \u201cYou have the gift of saying without saying. That is rare for one as you are.\u201d She began to make her way down into the valley, keeping one hand on my arm for support as she stepped carefully along a narrow rocky path that twisted along the valley wall. I spotted a young boy with a herd of sheep not too far off. He waved to us, but did not call out.\nWe made our way to the valley bottom where the stream rolled white over stones. It made clear pools where I could see the ripples of fish stirring in the water.\n\u201cWould you call this beautiful?\u201d she asked after we had looked a while. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nUncertainty. \u201cPerhaps its movement.\u201d\n\u201cThe stone moved not at all, and you called it beautiful as well.\u201d Questioning.\n\u201cIt is not the nature of stone to move. Perhaps it is beauty to move according to your nature.\u201d\nShe nodded as if my answer pleased her. We continued to watch the water. \u201cHave you heard of the Latantha?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Regret. \u201cBut perhaps I simply do not know the word.\u201d\nShe turned and we made our way along the valley floor until we came to a\nwider spot with the carefully groomed look of a garden. In the center of it", "was a tall tree the like of which I had never seen before.\nWe stopped at the edge of the clearing. \u201cThis is the sword tree,\u201d she said,\nand made a gesture I did not recognize, brushing the back of her hand against her cheek. \u201cThe Latantha. Would you say it is beautiful?\u201d\nI watched it for a moment. Curiosity.\u201cI would enjoy seeing it more closely.\u201d\n\u201cThat is not allowed.\u201d Emphatic.\nI nodded and watched it as well as I could from this distance. It had high, arching branches like an oak, but its leaves were broad, flat, and spun in odd circles when they caught the wind. \u201cYes.\u201d I answered after a long while.\n\u201cWhy did it take you so long to decide?\u201d\n\u201cI was considering the reason for its beauty,\u201d I admitted.\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\n\u201cI could say it both moves and doesn\u2019t move according to its nature, and\nthat grants it beauty. But I do not think that is the reason.\u201d\n\u201cWhy then?\u201d\nI watched it for a long time. \u201cI do not know. What do you consider the\nreason?\u201d\n\u201cIt simply is,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is enough.\u201d\nI nodded, feeling slightly foolish about the elaborate answers I had given\nbefore.\n\u201cDo you know of the Ketan?\u201d she asked, surprising me.\nI now had an inkling of how important such things were to the Adem. So I\nhesitated to give an open answer. However I did not want to lie either. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d Apology.\nShe nodded. \u201cYou are cautious.\u201d\n\u201cYes. Are you Shehyn?\u201d\nShehyn nodded. \u201cWhen did you suspect me of being who I am?\u201d \u201cWhen you asked of the Ketan,\u201d I said. \u201cWhen did you suspect me of\nknowing more than a barbarian should?\u201d\n\u201cWhen I saw you set your feet.\u201d\nAnother silence.\n\u201cShehyn, why do you not wear the red like other mercenaries?\u201d\nShe made a pair of unfamiliar gestures. \u201cHas your teacher told you why\nthey wear the red?\u201d\n\u201cI did not think to ask,\u201d I said, not wanting to imply Tempi had neglected\nmy training.", "\u201cI ask you then.\u201d\nI thought a moment. \u201cSo their enemies will not see them bleed?\u201d Approval. \u201cWhy then do I wear white?\u201d\nThe only answer I could think of chilled me. \u201cBecause you do not bleed.\u201d She gave a partial nod. \u201cAlso because if an enemy draws my blood, she\nshould see it as her fair reward.\u201d\nI fretted silently, doing my best to mimic proper Adem composure. After\nan appropriately polite pause, I asked. \u201cWhat will become of Tempi?\u201d\n\u201cThat remains to be seen.\u201d She gestured something close to irritation, then\nasked, \u201cAre you not concerned for yourself?\u201d\n\u201cI am more concerned for Tempi.\u201d\nThe sword tree spun patterns on the wind. It was almost hypnotic. \u201cHow far have you come in your training?\u201d Shehyn asked.\n\u201cI have studied the Ketan for a month.\u201d\nShe turned to face me and raised her hands. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d\nI could not help but think that she was shorter than me by six inches and\nold enough to be my grandmother. Her lopsided yellow hat didn\u2019t make her look terribly intimidating either. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d I said, and raised my hands as well.\nShehyn came toward me slowly, making Hands like Knives. I countered with Catching Rain. Then I made Climbing Iron and Fast Inward, but could not touch her. She quickened slightly, made Turning Breath and Striking Forward at the same time. I stopped one with Fan Water, but couldn\u2019t escape the other. She touched me below my ribs then on my temple, softly as you would press a finger to someone\u2019s lips.\nNothing I tried had any effect on her. I made Thrown Lighting, but she simply stepped away, not even bothering to counter. Once or twice I felt the brush of cloth against my hands as I came close enough to touch her white shirt, but that was all. It was like trying to strike a piece of hanging string.\nI set my teeth and made Threshing Wheat, Pressing Cider, and Mother at the Stream, moving seamlessly from one to the other in a flurry of blows.\nShe moved like nothing I had ever seen. It wasn\u2019t that she was fast, though she was fast, but that was not the heart of it. Shehyn moved perfectly, never taking two steps when one would do. Never moving four inches when she only needed three. She moved like something out of a story, more fluid and graceful than Felurian dancing.\nHoping to catch her by surprise and prove myself, I moved as fast as I", "dared. I made Maiden Dancing, Catching Sparrows, Fifteen Wolves . . . Shehyn took one single, perfect step.\n\u201cWhy do you weep?\u201d Shehyn asked as she made Heron Falling. \u201cAre you\nashamed? Are you in fear?\u201d\nI blinked my eyes to clear them. My voice was harsh from the exertion and\nemotion. \u201cYou are beautiful, Shehyn. For in you is the stone of the wall, the water of the stream, and the motion of the tree in one.\u201d\nShehyn blinked, and in her moment of surprise I found myself firmly gripping her shoulder and arm. I made Thunder Upward, but instead of being thrown, Shehyn stood still and solid as a stone.\nAlmost absentmindedly, she freed herself with Break Lion and made Threshing Wheat. I flew six feet and hit the ground.\nI was up quickly with no harm done. It was a gentle throw on soft turf, and Tempi had taught me how to fall without hurting myself. But before I could advance again Shehyn stopped me with a gesture.\n\u201cTempi has both taught you and not taught you,\u201d she said, her expression unreadable. I forced my eyes away from her face again. So hard to break that lifetime\u2019s worth of habit. \u201cWhich is both bad and good. Come.\u201d She turned and walked closer to the tree.\nIt was bigger than I had thought. The smaller branches moved in wild, curving patterns as the wind tossed them about.\nShehyn picked up a fallen leaf and handed it to me. It was broad and flat, the size of a small plate, and surprisingly heavy. My hand stung and I saw a thin line of blood trailing down my thumb.\nI examined the edge of the leaf and saw it was rigid, its edge as sharp as a blade of grass. Sword tree indeed. I looked up at the spinning leaves. Anyone standing near the tree when the wind was high would be cut to ribbons.\nShehyn said, \u201cIf you were to attack this tree, what would you do? Would you strike the root? No. Too strong. Would you strike the leaf? No. Too fast. Where then?\u201d\n\u201cThe branch.\u201d\n\u201cThe branch.\u201d Agreement. She turned to me. \u201cThat is what Tempi has not taught you. It would have been wrong for him to teach you that. Nevertheless, you have suffered for it.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\nShe gestured for me to begin the Ketan. Automatically I fell into Catch Sparrows.", "\u201cStop.\u201d I froze in position. \u201cIf I am to attack you, where should it be? Here, at the root?\u201d She pushed my leg and found it unyielding. \u201cHere at the leaf?\u201d She pushed at my upheld hand, moving it easily, but accomplishing little else. \u201cHere. The branch.\u201d She pushed gently against one of my shoulders, moving me easily. \u201cAnd here.\u201d She added pressure to my hip, spinning me around. \u201cDo you see? You find the place to spend your strength, or it is wasted. Wasting strength is not of the Lethani.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Shehyn.\u201d\nShe raised her hands, falling into the position where I had caught her before, midway through Heron Falling. \u201cMake Thunder Upward. Where is my root?\u201d\nI pointed to her solidly planted feet.\n\u201cWhere is the leaf?\u201d\nI pointed to her hands.\n\u201cNo. From here to here is the leaf.\u201d She indicated her whole arm and\ndemonstrated how she could freely strike with her hands, elbows or shoulders. \u201cWhere is the branch?\u201d\nI thought for a long moment, then tapped her knee.\nThough she gave no sign of it, I sensed her surprise. \u201cAnd?\u201d\nI tapped her opposite side under her armpit, then her shoulder. \u201cShow me.\u201d\nI came in close to her, set one leg close against her knee, and made\nThunder Upward, throwing her to the side. I was surprised at how little force was required.\nHowever, instead of being thrown into the air to tumble to the ground, Shehyn gripped my forearm. I felt a jolt run up my arm and was pulled one staggering step to the side. Rather than being thrown Shehyn used her grip as leverage so her feet came down beneath her. She took a single perfect step and had her balance again.\nShehyn looked me straight in the eye for a long, speculative moment, then turned to leave, gesturing for me to follow.", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN\nA Liar and a Thief\nSHEHYN AND I RETURNED to the complex of stone buildings to find Tempi standing outside, shifting nervously from foot to foot. That confirmed my suspicion. He hadn\u2019t sent Shehyn to test me. She had found me on her own.\nWhen we came close enough, Tempi held his sword out in his right hand, point down. His left hand gestured elaborate respect. \u201cShehyn,\u201d he said, \u201cI \u2014\u201d\nShehyn motioned for him to follow as she entered the low stone building. She motioned to a young boy. \u201cFetch Carceret.\u201d The boy took off running.\nCuriosity. I gestured to Tempi.\nHe didn\u2019t look at me. Profound seriousness. Attend. It didn\u2019t reassure me that these were the same gestures he had made on the road to Crosson when he thought we were walking into an ambush. His hands, I noticed, were shaking slightly.\nShehyn led us to an open doorway where a woman in mercenary reds joined us. I recognized the thin scars on her eyebrow and jaw. This was Carceret, the mercenary we had met while heading to Severen, the one who had pushed me.\nShehyn motioned the two mercenaries inside, but held up a hand to me. \u201cWait here. What Tempi has done is not good. I will listen. Then I will decide what is to be done with you.\u201d\nI nodded, and she closed the door behind her.\nI waited for an hour, then two. I strained my ears, but I couldn\u2019t hear anything from the other side of the door. A few people walked past in the hallway: two in mercenary reds, and another in simple grey homespun. Each\n \nof them looked at my hair, though none of them stared.\nInstead of smiling and nodding as would have been sociable among\nbarbarians, I kept my face blank, returned their small gestures of greeting, and avoided touching eyes.\nSomewhere past the third hour, the door opened and Shehyn waved me inside.\nIt was a well-lit room with walls of finished stone. It was the size of a large bedroom at an inn, but seemed even larger due to the lack of any significant furniture. There was a small iron stove radiating gentle heat near one wall, and four chairs facing each other in a rough circle. Tempi, Shehyn, and Carceret filled three of them. At a gesture from Shehyn, I took the fourth.\n\u201cHow many have you killed?\u201d Shehyn asked. Her tone was different than before. Peremptory. It was the same tone Tempi used during our discussions of the Lethani.\n\u201cMany.\u201d I responded without any hesitation. I might be thick at times, but I know when I\u2019m being tested.\n\u201cHow many is many?\u201d Not a request for clarification. It was a new question.\n\u201cIn killing men, one is many.\u201d\nShe nodded slightly. \u201cHave you killed men outside of the Lethani?\u201d \u201cPerhaps.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you not say yes or no?\u201d\n\u201cBecause the Lethani has not always been clear to me.\u201d\n\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d\n\u201cBecause the Lethani is not always clear.\u201d\n\u201cWhat makes the Lethani clear?\u201d\nI hesitated, though I knew it wasn\u2019t the right thing to do. \u201cThe words of a\nteacher.\u201d\n\u201cCan one teach the Lethani?\u201d\nI began to gesture uncertainty, then remembered hand-talk wasn\u2019t\nappropriate. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d I said. \u201cI cannot.\u201d\nTempi shifted slightly in his chair. This wasn\u2019t going well. For lack of any\nother ideas, I took a deep breath, relaxed, and tipped my mind gently into Spinning Leaf.\n\u201cWho knows the Lethani?\u201d Shehyn asked.\n\u201cThe windblown leaf,\u201d I responded, though I cannot honestly say what I meant by it.", "\u201cWhere does the Lethani come from?\u201d\n\u201cThe same place as laughing.\u201d\nShehyn hesitated slightly, then said, \u201cHow do you follow the Lethani?\u201d \u201cHow do you follow the moon?\u201d\nMy time with Tempi had taught me to appreciate the different sorts of\npauses that can punctuate a conversation. Ademic is a language that says as much with silence as with words. There is a pregnant pause. A polite pause. A confused pause. There is a pause that implies much, a pause that apologizes, a pause that adds emphasis....\nThis pause was a sudden gape in the conversation. It was the empty space of an indrawn breath. I sensed I had said something very clever or something very stupid.\nShehyn shifted in her seat, and the air of formality evaporated. Sensing we were moving on, I let my mind settle out of Spinning Leaf.\nShehyn turned to look at Carceret. \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d\nCarceret had sat like a statue through all of this, expressionless and still. \u201cI say as I have said before. Tempi has netinad us all. He should be cut away. This is the reason we have laws. To ignore a law is to erase it.\u201d\n\u201cTo blindly follow law is to be a slave,\u201d Tempi said quickly.\nShehyn gestured sharp rebuke, and Tempi flushed with embarrassment. \u201cAs for this.\u201d Carceret gestured at me. Dismissal. \u201cHe is not of Ademre. At\nbest he is a fool. At worst a liar and a thief.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what he said today?\u201d Shehyn asked.\n\u201cA dog can bark three times without counting.\u201d\nShehyn turned to Tempi. \u201cBy speaking out of turn you refuse your turn to\nspeak.\u201d Tempi flushed again, his lips growing pale as he struggled to maintain his composure.\nShehyn drew a deep breath and let it out slowly. \u201cThe Ketan and the Lethani are what make us Ademre,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no way a barbarian can know of the Ketan.\u201d Both Tempi and Carceret stirred, but she held up a hand. \u201cAt the same time, to destroy one who has understanding of the Lethani is not correct. The Lethani does not destroy itself.\u201d\nShe said \u201cdestroy\u201d very casually. I hoped I might be mistaken as to the true meaning of the Ademic word.\nShehyn continued. \u201cThere are those who might say, \u2018This one has enough. Do not teach him the Lethani, because whoever has knowledge of the Lethani overcomes all things.\u2019 \u201d", "Shehyn gave a severe look to Carceret. \u201cBut I am not one who would say that. I think the world would be better if more were of the Lethani. For while it brings power, the Lethani also brings wisdom in the use of power.\u201d\nThere was a long pause. My stomach knotted itself as I tried to maintain a calm appearance. \u201cI think,\u201d Shehyn said at last, \u201cit is possible Tempi did not make a mistake.\u201d\nThis seemed a long way from a ringing endorsement, but from the sudden stiffness in Carceret\u2019s back and Tempi\u2019s slow, relieved exhalation, I guessed it was the news we were hoping for.\n\u201cI will give him to Vashet,\u201d Shehyn said.\nTempi went motionless. Carceret made a gesture of approval wide as a madman\u2019s smile.\nTempi\u2019s voice was strained. \u201cYou will give him to the Hammer?\u201d His hand flickered. Respect. Negation. Respect.\nShehyn got to her feet, signaling an end to the discussion. \u201cWho better? The Hammer will show if he is iron worth striking.\u201d\nWith this, Shehyn pulled Tempi aside and spoke to him for a brief moment. Her hands brushed his arms lightly. Her voice was too soft for even my finely tuned eavesdropper\u2019s ears.\nI stood politely near my chair. All the fight seemed to have left Tempi, and his gestures were a steady rhythm of agreement and respect.\nCarceret stood apart from them as well, staring at me. Her expression was composed, but her eyes were angry. At her side, out of sight of the other two, she made several small gestures. The only one I understood was disgust, but I could guess the general meaning of the others.\nIn return, I made a gesture that was not Ademic. By the narrowing of her eyes, I suspected she managed to glean my meaning fairly well.\nThere was the high sound of a bell ringing three times. A moment later, Tempi kissed Shehyn\u2019s hands, the peak of her forehead, and her mouth. Then he turned and motioned for me to follow.\nTogether we walked to a large, low-ceilinged room filled with people and the smell of food. It was a dining hall, full of long tables and dark wooden benches worn smooth with time.\nI followed Tempi, gathering food onto a wide wooden plate. Only then did I realize how terribly hungry I was.\nDespite my expectations, this dining hall didn\u2019t resemble the Mess at the University in the least. It was quieter for one thing, and the food was far", "better. There was fresh milk and lean tender meat that I suspected was goat. There was hard, sharp cheese and soft, creamy cheese and two kinds of bread still warm from the oven. There were apples and strawberries for the taking. Saltboxes sat open on all the tables, and everyone could take as much as they liked.\nIt was strange being in a room full of Adem talking. They spoke so softly I couldn\u2019t make out any words, but I could see their hands flickering. I could only understand one gesture in ten, but it was odd being able to see all the flickering emotions around me: Amusement. Anger. Embarrassment. Negation. Disgust. I wondered how much of it was about me, the barbarian among them.\nThere were more women than I\u2019d expected, and more young children. There were a handful of the familiar blood-red mercenaries, but more wore the simple grey I\u2019d seen during my walk with Shehyn. I saw a white shirt as well, and was surprised to see it was Shehyn herself, eating elbow to elbow with the rest of us.\nNone of them stared at me, but they were looking. A lot of attention was being paid to my hair, which was understandable. There were fifty sandy heads in the room, a few darker, a few lighter or grey with age. I stood out like a single burning candle.\nI tried to draw Tempi into a conversation, but he would have none of it and focused on his food instead. He hadn\u2019t loaded his plate nearly as full as mine and ate only a fraction of what he took.\nWith no conversation to slow things, I finished quickly. When my plate was empty, Tempi quit pretending to eat and led us away. I could feel dozens of eyes on my back as we left the room.\nHe took me down a series of passages until we came to a door. Tempi opened it, revealing a small room with a window and a bed. My lute and travelsack were there. My sword was not.\n\u201cYou are to have another teacher,\u201d Tempi spoke at last. \u201cDo your best. Be civilized. Your teacher will decide much.\u201d Regret. \u201cYou will not see me.\u201d\nHe was obviously troubled, but I couldn\u2019t think of anything to say that might reassure him. Instead I gave him a comforting hug, which he seemed to appreciate. Then he turned and left without another word.\nInside my room, I undressed and lay on the bed. It seems like I should say I tossed and turned, nervous about what was to come. But the simple truth is that I was exhausted and slept like a happy baby at his mother\u2019s breast.", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWELVE": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWELVE\nThe Hammer\nI SAT IN A TINY park composed of nothing more than two smooth stone benches, a handful of trees, and a small path running through the long grass. You could walk from one edge to the other in a minute. There were cliffs close on two sides, sheltering it from the wind. Not out of the wind, mind you. There didn\u2019t seem to be anywhere in all of Haert entirely out of the wind.\nAs Vashet approached, the first thing I noticed was that she didn\u2019t wear her sword on her hip. Instead she slung it over her shoulder, just as I carried my lute. She walked with the most subtle, solid confidence I have ever seen, as if she knew she ought to swagger, but couldn\u2019t quite be bothered.\nShe had the same moderate build I\u2019d come to expect from the Adem along with the pale, creamy complexion and grey eyes. Her hair was lighter than Tempi\u2019s by a fine shade, and she wore it pulled back into a horsetail. When she came closer, I could see her nose had been broken at some point, and while it wasn\u2019t crooked, the slight crimp looked strangely incongruous on her otherwise delicate face.\nVashet smiled at me, a wide pink smile that showed her white teeth. \u201cSo,\u201d she said in flawless Aturan. \u201cYou are mine now.\u201d\n\u201cYou speak Aturan,\u201d I said stupidly.\n\u201cMost of us do,\u201d she said. There were a few lines around the mouth and the corners of her eyes, so I guessed she was perhaps ten years older than me. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to make your way in the world if you don\u2019t have a good grip on the language. Hard to do business.\u201d\nI remembered myself too late. Formal. Respect. \u201cAm I correct in assuming you are Vashet?\u201d\nThe smile tugged back onto her mouth. Vashet returned my gesture broadly, exaggerating it so I couldn\u2019t help but feel I was being mocked. \u201cI am. I am to be your teacher.\u201d\n\u201cWhat of Shehyn? I understood she was the teacher here.\u201d", "Vashet arched an eyebrow at me, the extravagant expression startling on an Adem face. \u201cIn a general sense that is true. But in a more practical sense, Shehyn is far too important to be spending her time with someone like you.\u201d\nI gestured, polite. \u201cI was quite happy with Tempi,\u201d I said.\n\u201cAnd if your happiness were our goal, that might matter,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, Tempi is closer to being a sailboat than a teacher.\u201d\nI bristled a little at that. \u201cHe is my friend, you realize.\u201d\nHer eyes narrowed. \u201cThen as his friend you may fail to realize his faults. He is a competent fighter, but no more than that. He barely speaks your language, has little experience with the real world, and, to be completely frank, he is not terribly bright.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. Regret. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to offend you.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t show me humility unless you mean it,\u201d she said, still looking me over with narrow eyes. \u201cEven when you make your face a mask, your eyes are like glittering windows.\u201d\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d I said earnestly. Apology. \u201cI\u2019d hoped to make a good first impression.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cI would rather you thought well of me.\u201d\n\u201cI would rather have reason to think well of you.\u201d\nI decided to take another tack, hoping to steer the conversation into safer\nwater. \u201cTempi called you the Hammer. Why is that?\u201d\n\u201cThat is my name. Vashet. The Hammer. The Clay. The Spinning Wheel.\u201d\nShe pronounced her name three separate ways, each with its own cadence. \u201cI am that which shapes and sharpens, or destroys.\u201d\n\u201cWhy the clay?\u201d\n\u201cThat is also what I am,\u201d Vashet said. \u201cOnly that which bends can teach.\u201d I felt a growing excitement as she spoke, \u201cI will admit,\u201d I said. \u201cIt will be\npleasant to share a language with my teacher. There are a thousand questions I have not asked because I knew Tempi could not understand. Or even if he did, I wouldn\u2019t be able to make sense of his answers.\u201d\nVashet nodded and sat down on one of the benches. \u201cKnowing how to communicate is also the way of a teacher,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, go find a long piece of wood and bring it back to me. Then we will begin the lesson.\u201d\nI headed off into the trees. Her request had a ritual air about it, so I didn\u2019t want to run back with any odd branch I found on the ground. Eventually I found a willow tree and snapped off a supple branch longer than my arm and", "big around as my little finger.\nI returned to where Vashet sat on the bench. I handed her the willow\nbranch, and she pulled her sword over her shoulder and began to trim the smaller nubs of the remaining branches away.\n\u201cYou said only that which bends can teach,\u201d I said. \u201cSo I thought this would be appropriate.\u201d\n\u201cIt will serve for today\u2019s lesson,\u201d she said as she stripped the last of the bark away, leaving nothing but a slender white rod. She wiped her sword on her shirt, sheathed it, and came to her feet.\nHolding the willow branch in one hand, Vashet swung it back and forth, making a low whop whop noise as it skimmed through the air.\nNow that she was closer to me, I noticed that while Vashet wore the familiar mercenary reds, unlike Tempi and many of the others, her clothes weren\u2019t held tight with leather straps. Her shirt and pants were bound snugly to her arms and legs and chest by bands of blood-red silk instead.\nShe met my eye. \u201cI am going to hit you now,\u201d she said seriously. \u201cStand still.\u201d\nVashet began to walk around me in a slow circle, still swinging the willow rod. Whop whop. She moved behind me, and not being able to see her was worse. Whop whop. She swung the rod faster and the noise changed. Viiiip. Viiiip. I didn\u2019t flinch.\nShe circled again, moved behind me, then hit me twice. Once on each arm just below the shoulder. Viiiip. Viiiip. At first it merely felt like she\u2019d tapped me, then pain blossomed across my arms, blazing like fire.\nThen, before I could react, she struck me across the back so hard I felt the impact in my teeth. The only reason the rod didn\u2019t break is because it was supple green willow.\nI didn\u2019t cry out, but only because she had caught me between breaths. I gasped though, sucking in air so quickly I choked and coughed. My back screamed with pain as if it had been set afire.\nShe came around to the front of me again, giving me that same serious look. \u201cHere is your lesson,\u201d she said matter-of-factly. \u201cI do not think well of you. You are a barbarian. You are not clever. You are not welcome. You do not belong here. You are a thief of our secrets. Your presence is an embarrassment and a complication this school does not need.\u201d\nVashet contemplated the end of the willow rod, then turned her eyes back to me. \u201cWe will meet here again, an hour after lunch. You will pick another", "stick, and I will try to teach you this lesson again.\u201d She gave me a pointed look. \u201cIf the stick you bring me does not please me, I will choose my own.\n\u201cWe will do the same after dinner. Then the same the next day. This is the only lesson I have to teach you. When you learn it, you will leave Haert and never return.\u201d She looked at me, her face cool. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d\n\u201cWhat will\u2014\u201d Her hand flicked out, and the tip of the rod caught me on the cheek. This time I had the breath for it, and I gave a high, startled yelp.\nVashet looked at me. I\u2019d never thought anything so simple as eye contact could be so intimidating. But her pale grey eyes were hard as ice. \u201cSay to me, \u2018Yes, Vashet. I understand.\u2019 \u201d\nI glared. \u201cYes, Vashet. I understand.\u201d The right side of my upper lip felt huge and unwieldy as I spoke.\nShe searched my face, as if trying to decide something, then shrugged and tossed the stick aside.\nOnly then did I risk speaking again. \u201cWhat would happen to Tempi if I were to leave?\u201d\n\u201cWhen you leave,\u201d she said, stressing the first word. \u201cThe few that doubt it will know he was wrong to teach you. Doubly wrong to bring you here.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what will . . .\u201d I paused and backtracked. \u201cWhat would become of him in that case?\u201d\nShe shrugged and turned away. \u201cThat is not for me to decide,\u201d she said, and walked away.\nI touched my cheek and lip, then looked at my hand. No blood, but I could feel the red welt rising on my skin, plain as a brand for anyone to see.\nNot sure what else I should do, I returned to the school for lunch. After making my way to the dining hall, I looked around but didn\u2019t see Tempi among the blood-red mercenaries there. I was glad for that. As much as I would have enjoyed some friendly company, I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of him knowing how badly things had gone. I wouldn\u2019t even need to tell him. The mark on my face said it plainly for everyone in the room to see.\nI kept my face impassive and my eyes low as I moved through the line and filled my plate. Then I chose an empty section of table, not wanting to force my company on anyone.\n \nI have been alone for most of my life. But rarely have I felt it so much as at that moment. I knew one person within four hundred miles, and he\u2019d been ordered to keep away from me. I was unfamiliar with the culture, barely competent with the language, and the burning all across my back and face was a constant reminder of how much I was unwelcome.\nThe food was good though. Roasted chicken, crisp longbeans, and a slice of sweet molasses pudding. Better fare than I could usually afford for myself at the University, and hotter than the food at the Maer\u2019s estate. I wasn\u2019t particularly hungry, but I\u2019ve been hungry enough in my life that I have a hard time walking away from an easy meal.\nThere was a shadow of movement on the edge of my vision as someone sat down across the table from me. I felt my mood lighten. At least one person was brave enough to visit the barbarian. Someone was kind enough to comfort me, or at least curious enough to come and talk.\nLifting my head I saw Carceret\u2019s lean, scarred face. She set her wide wooden plate down across from me.\n\u201cHow do you like our town?\u201d she said quietly, her left hand resting on the surface of the table. Her gestures were different, as we were sitting, but I could still recognize curious and polite. To anyone watching, it would seem like we were having a pleasant conversation. \u201cHow do you like your new teacher? She thinks as I think. That you do not belong.\u201d\nI chewed another mouthful of chicken and swallowed mechanically, not looking up.\nConcern. \u201cI heard you cry out,\u201d she continued softly. She spoke slower now, as if talking to a child. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was meant as an insult, or to ensure I understood her. \u201cIt was like a tiny bird.\u201d\nI took a drink of warm goat\u2019s milk and wiped my mouth. The motion of my arm pulled my shirt across the welt on my back, stinging like a hundred wasps.\n\u201cWas it a cry of love?\u201d she asked, making a gesture I didn\u2019t recognize. \u201cDid Vashet embrace you? Does your cheek bear the mark of her tongue?\u201d\nI took a bit of pudding. It wasn\u2019t as sweet as I remembered.\nCarceret took a bite of her own pudding. \u201cEveryone gambles on when you will leave,\u201d she continued, still speaking slow and low, for my ears only. \u201cI have two talents wagered that you will not last a second day. If you leave in the night, as I hope, I win silver. If I am wrong and you stay, I win in bruises and listening to your cries.\u201d Entreaty. \u201cStay.\u201d", "I looked up at her. \u201cYou speak as a dog barks,\u201d I said. \u201cWith no end. With no sense.\u201d\nI spoke quietly enough to be polite. But not so quietly that my voice didn\u2019t reach the ears of everyone sitting close to us. I know how to make a soft voice carry. We Ruh invented the stage whisper.\nI saw her face flush, making the pale scars on her jaw and eyebrow stand out.\nI looked down and continued to eat, the very picture of calm unconcern. It\u2019s tricky, insulting someone from a different culture. But I\u2019d chosen my words carefully, based on things I\u2019d heard Tempi say. If she responded in any way, it would only seem to prove my point.\nI finished the rest of my meal slowly and methodically, imagining I could feel the rage rolling off her like waves of heat. This small battle, at least, I could win. It was a hollow victory, of course. But sometimes you have to take what you can get.\nWhen Vashet returned to the small park, I was already sitting on one of the stone benches, waiting for her.\nShe stood before me and sighed gustily. \u201cLovely. A slow learner,\u201d she said in her perfect Aturan. \u201cGo fetch your stick then. We\u2019ll see if I can make my point more clearly this time.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve already found my stick,\u201d I said. I reached behind the bench and brought out a wooden training sword I\u2019d borrowed from the school.\nIt was old, oiled wood, worn smooth by countless hands, hard and heavy as a bar of iron. If she used this to strike my shoulders as she had with the willow rod, it would break bones. If she struck my face, it would shatter my jaw.\nI set it on the bench beside me. The wood didn\u2019t clatter against the stone. It was so hard it almost rang like a bell.\nAfter I set down the training sword, I began to pull my shirt up over my head, sucking a breath through my teeth when it dragged against the hot welt on my back.\n\u201cAre you hoping to sway me with the offer of your tender young body?\u201d Vashet asked. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty, but not so pretty as that.\u201d\n \nI laid my shirt carefully on the bench. \u201cI just thought it would be best if I showed you something.\u201d I turned so she could see my back.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been whipped,\u201d she said. \u201cI cannot say I\u2019m surprised. I already knew you to be a thief.\u201d\n\u201cThese are not from thieving,\u201d I said. \u201cThese are from the University. I was brought up on charges and sentenced to be whipped. When this happens, many students simply leave and take their education elsewhere. I decided to stay. It was only three lashes, after all.\u201d\nI waited, still facing away. After a moment she took the bait. \u201cThere are more scars here than three lashes can account for.\u201d\n\u201cSome time after that,\u201d I said, \u201cI was brought up on charges again. Six lashes this time. Still I stayed.\u201d I turned back to face her. \u201cI stayed because there was no other place I could learn what I desired. Mere whipping could not keep me away from it.\u201d\nI picked up the heavy wooden sword from the bench. \u201cI thought it only fair that you should know this. I cannot be frightened away with the threat of pain. I will not abandon Tempi after the trust he has shown me. There are things I desire to learn, and I can only learn them here.\u201d\nI handed her the hard, dark piece of wood. \u201cIf you want me to leave, you must do worse than welts.\u201d\nI stepped back and let my hands hang at my sides. I closed my eyes.", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTEEN": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTEEN\nBarbarian Tongue\nI\u2019D LIKE TO SAY I kept my eyes closed, but that wouldn\u2019t be the truth. I heard the gritty sound of dirt beneath the soles of Vashet\u2019s shoes and couldn\u2019t help but open them.\nI didn\u2019t peek. That would only make me seem childish. I simply opened my eyes and looked at her. She stared back, making more eye contact than I would get from Tempi in a span of days. Her pale grey eyes were hard in her delicate face. Her broken nose no longer looked out of place. It was a grim warning to the world.\nThe wind swirled between us, raising gooseflesh on my naked arms.\nVashet drew a resigned breath and shrugged, then flipped the wooden rod to grip the handle end. She hefted it thoughtfully with both hands, getting a feel for its weight. Then she brought it up to her shoulder and swung.\nExcept she didn\u2019t.\n\u201cFine!\u201d she said, exasperated, throwing up her hands. \u201cYou twiggy little skeeth. Fine! Shit and onions. Put your shirt back on. You\u2019re making me cold.\u201d\nI sank down until I was sitting on the bench. \u201cThank God,\u201d I said. I started to put my shirt back on, but it was difficult, as my hands were shaking. It wasn\u2019t from the cold.\nVashet saw. \u201cI knew it!\u201d she said triumphantly, pointing a finger at me. \u201cYou standing there like you\u2019re ready to be hanged. I knew you were ready to run like a rabbit!\u201d She stamped her foot in frustration. \u201cI knew I should have taken a swing at you!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t,\u201d I said. I managed to get my shirt on, then realized it was inside out. I decided to leave it rather than drag it across my stinging back again.\n\u201cWhat gave me away?\u201d she demanded.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d I said. \u201cIt was a masterful performance.\u201d\n\u201cThen how\u2019d you know I wasn\u2019t going to crack your skull open?\u201d", "\u201cI thought it through,\u201d I said. \u201cIf Shehyn had really wanted me driven off, she could have just sent me packing. If she wanted me dead, she could have done that too.\u201d\nI rubbed my sweaty hands on my pants. \u201cThat meant you were really meant to be my teacher. So there were only three sensible options.\u201d I held up a finger. \u201cThis was a ritual initiation.\u201d A second finger. \u201cIt was test of my resolve . . .\u201d\n\u201cOr I was really trying to run you off,\u201d Vashet finished as she sat on the bench opposite me. \u201cWhat if I\u2019d been telling the truth and thumped you bloody?\u201d\nI shrugged. \u201cAt least I\u2019d have known. But it seemed like long odds that Shehyn would choose someone like that. If she\u2019d wanted me beaten she could have let Carceret do it.\u201d I cocked my head. \u201cOut of curiosity, which was it? Initiation or test of resolve? Does everyone go through this?\u201d\nShe shook her head. \u201cResolve. I needed to make sure of you. I wasn\u2019t going to waste my time teaching a coward or someone afraid of a little smack or two. I also needed to know you were dedicated.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cThat seemed the most likely. I thought I\u2019d save myself several days of welts and force the issue.\u201d\nVashet gave me a long look, curiosity plain on her face. \u201cI will admit, I\u2019ve never had a student offer himself up for a vicious beating in order to prove he\u2019s worth my time.\u201d\n\u201cThis was nothing,\u201d I said nonchalantly. \u201cOnce I jumped off a roof.\u201d\nWe spent an hour talking about small things, letting the tension between us slowly bleed away. She asked how exactly I\u2019d come to be whipped, and I gave her the bones of the story, glad to have the chance to explain myself. I didn\u2019t want her thinking of me as a criminal.\nVashet examined my scars more closely afterward. \u201cWhoever tended to you certainly knew their physic,\u201d she said admiringly. \u201cThis is very clean work. As good as any I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll pass along your compliments,\u201d I said.\nHer hand brushed gently along the edge of the hot welt that ran across the whole length of my back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for this, by the way.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt hurts worse than the whipping ever did, I\u2019ll tell you that for free.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be gone in a day or two,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich isn\u2019t to say you won\u2019t be sleeping on your stomach tonight.\u201d She helped me settle my shirt, then moved back to the other bench, facing me.\nI hesitated before saying, \u201cNo offense, Vashet. But you seem different from the other Adem I\u2019ve met. Not that I\u2019ve met many, mind you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re just hungry for familiar body language,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThere is that,\u201d I said. \u201cBut you seem more . . . expressive than the other Adem I\u2019ve seen.\u201d I pointed at my face.\nVashet shrugged. \u201cWhere I\u2019m from, we grow up speaking your language. And I spent four years as bodyguard and captain for a poet in the Small Kingdoms who also happened to be a king. I probably speak Aturan better than anyone in Haert. Including you.\u201d\nI ignored the last. \u201cYou didn\u2019t grow up here?\u201d\nShe shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m from Feant, a town farther north. We\u2019re more . . . cosmopolitan. Haert only has the one school, and everyone is tied very tightly to it. The sword tree is one of the old paths, too. Rather formal. I grew up following the path of joy.\u201d\n\u201cThere are other schools?\u201d\nVashet nodded. \u201cThis is one of the many schools that follow the Latantha, the path of the sword tree. It\u2019s one of the oldest, behind the Aethe and Aratan. There are other paths, maybe three dozen. But some of those are very small, with only one or two schools teaching their Ketan.\u201d\n\u201cIs that why your sword is different?\u201d I asked. \u201cDid you bring it from your other school?\u201d\nVashet gave me a narrow look. \u201cWhat do you know of my sword?\u201d\n\u201cYou brought it out to trim the willow switch,\u201d I said. \u201cTempi\u2019s sword was well-made, but yours is different. The handle is worn, but the blade looks new.\u201d\nShe gave me a curious look. \u201cWell you certainly have your eyes open, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nI shrugged.\n\u201cStrictly speaking, it\u2019s not my sword,\u201d Vashet said. \u201cIt\u2019s merely in my keeping. It is an old sword, and the blade is the oldest part of it. It was given to me by Shehyn herself.\u201d\n\u201cIs that why you came to this school?\u201d\nVashet shook her head. \u201cNo. Shehyn gave me the sword much later.\u201d She", "reached back and touched the hilt fondly. \u201cNo. I came here because while the Latantha might be rather formal, they excel in the use of the sword. I had learned as much as I could from the path of joy. Three other schools refused me before Shehyn brought me in. She is a clever woman and realized there was something to be gained in teaching me.\u201d\n\u201cI guess we\u2019re both lucky she has an open mind,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou more than me,\u201d Vashet said. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain amount of one- upsmanship among the different paths. When I joined the Latantha, it was a bit of a feather in Shehyn\u2019s cap.\u201d\n\u201cIt must have been hard,\u201d I said. \u201cComing here and being the stranger to everyone.\u201d\nVashet shrugged, making her sword rise and fall on her shoulder. \u201cAt first,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut they recognize talent, and I have that to spare. Among those who study the path of joy, I was viewed as rather stiff and stodgy. But here I\u2019m seen as somewhat wild.\u201d She grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s pleasant, like having a new set of clothes to wear.\u201d\n\u201cDoes the path of joy also teach the Lethani?\u201d I asked.\nVashet laughed. \u201cThat is a matter of some considerable debate. The simple answer is yes. All Adem study the Lethani to some degree. Those in the schools especially. That said, the Lethani is open to a broad interpretation. What some schools cling to, others spurn.\u201d\nShe gave me a thoughtful look. \u201cIs it true you said the Lethani comes from the same place as laughing?\u201d\nI nodded.\n\u201cThat is a good answer,\u201d she said. \u201cMy teacher in the path of joy once said that very thing to me.\u201d Vashet frowned. \u201cYou look pensive when I say that. Why?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d tell you,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want you to think less of me.\u201d\n\u201cI think less of you for keeping something from your teacher,\u201d she said seriously. \u201cThere must be trust between us.\u201d\nI sighed. \u201cI am glad you like my answer. But honestly, I don\u2019t know what it means.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you what it means,\u201d she said easily.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a nonsense answer,\u201d I said. \u201cI know you all place great stock in the Lethani, but I don\u2019t really understand it. I\u2019ve just found a way to fake it.\u201d\nVashet smiled indulgently. \u201cThere is no pretending to understand the Lethani,\u201d she said confidently. \u201cIt is like swimming. It is obvious to anyone", "watching if you really know the way of it.\u201d\n\u201cA person can pretend to swim too,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cI\u2019ve simply been\nmoving my arms and walking on the bottom of the river.\u201d\nShe gave me a curious look. \u201cVery well then. How have you managed to\nfool us?\u201d\nI explained Spinning Leaf to her. How I had learned to tip my thoughts\ninto a light, empty, floating place where the answers to their questions came easily.\n\u201cSo you have stolen the answers from yourself,\u201d she said with mock seriousness. \u201cYou have cleverly fooled us by pulling the answers from your own mind.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d I said, growing irritated. \u201cI don\u2019t have the slightest idea what the Lethani really is! It\u2019s not a path, but it helps choose a path. It\u2019s the simplest way, but it is not easy to see. Honestly, you people sound like drunk cartographers.\u201d\nI regretted saying it as soon as it was out of my mouth, but Vashet merely laughed. \u201cThere are many drunks who are quite conversant with the Lethani,\u201d she said. \u201cSeveral legendarily so.\u201d\nSeeing I was still agitated, she made a motion to calm me. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the Lethani either, not in a way that can be explained to another. The teaching of the Lethani is an art I do not possess. If Tempi has managed to instill the Lethani in you, it is a great mark in his favor.\u201d\nVashet leaned forward seriously. \u201cPart of the problem is with your language,\u201d she said. \u201cAturan is very explicit. It is very precise and direct. Our language is rich with implication, so it is easier for us to accept the existence of things that cannot be explained. The Lethani is the greatest of these.\u201d\n\u201cCan you give me an example of one other than the Lethani?\u201d I asked. \u201cAnd please don\u2019t say \u2018blue,\u2019 or I might go absolutely mad right here on this bench.\u201d\nShe thought for a moment. \u201cLove is such a thing.You have knowledge of what it is, but it defies careful explication.\u201d\n\u201cLove is a subtle concept,\u201d I admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s elusive, like justice, but it can be defined.\u201d\nHer eyes sparkled. \u201cDo so then, my clever student. Tell me of love.\u201d\nI thought for a quick moment, then for a long moment.\nVashet grinned. \u201cYou see how easy it will be for me to pick holes in any\ndefinition you give.\u201d", "\u201cLove is the willingness to do anything for someone,\u201d I said. \u201cEven at detriment to yourself.\u201d\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d she said. \u201cHow is love different from duty or loyalty?\u201d \u201cIt is also combined with a physical attraction,\u201d I said.\n\u201cEven a mother\u2019s love?\u201d Vashet asked.\n\u201cCombined with an extreme fondness then,\u201d I amended.\n\u201cAnd what exactly do you mean by \u2018fondness\u2019?\u201d she asked with a maddening calm.\n\u201cIt is . . .\u201d I trailed off, racking my brain to think how I could describe love without resorting to other, equally abstract terms.\n\u201cThis is the nature of love.\u201d Vashet said. \u201cTo attempt to describe it will drive a woman mad. That is what keeps poets scribbling endlessly away. If one could pin it to the paper all complete, the others would lay down their pens. But it cannot be done.\u201d\nShe held up a finger. \u201cBut only a fool claims there is no such thing as love. When you see two young ones staring at each other with dewy eyes, there it is. So thick you can spread it on your bread and eat it. When you see a mother with her child, you see love. When you feel it roil in your belly, you know what it is. Even if you cannot give voice to it in words.\u201d\nVashet made a triumphant gesture. \u201cThus also is the Lethani. But as it is greater, it is more difficult to point toward. That is the purpose of the questions. Asking them is like asking a young girl about the boy she fancies. Her answers may not use the word, but they reveal love or the lack of it within her heart.\u201d\n\u201cHow can my answers reveal a knowledge of the Lethani when I don\u2019t truly know what it is?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cYou obviously understand the Lethani,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is rooted deep inside you. Too deep for you to see. Sometimes it is the same with love.\u201d\nVashet reached out and tapped me on the forehead. \u201cAs for this Spinning Leaf. I have heard of similar things practiced by other paths. There is no Aturan word for it that I know. It is like a Ketan for your mind. A motion you make with your thoughts, to train them.\u201d\nShe made a dismissive gesture. \u201cEither way, it is not cheating. It is a way of revealing that which is hidden in the deep waters of your mind. The fact that you found it on your own is quite remarkable.\u201d\nI nodded to her. \u201cI bow to your wisdom, Vashet.\u201d \u201cYou bow to the fact that I am unarguably correct.\u201d", "She clapped her hands together. \u201cNow, I have much to teach you. However, as you are still welted and flinching, let us forbear the Ketan. Show me your Ademic instead. I want to hear you wound my lovely language with your rough barbarian tongue.\u201d\nI learned a great deal about Ademic over the next several hours. It was refreshing to be able to ask detailed questions and receive clear, specific answers in return. After a month of dancing about and drawing in the dirt, learning from Vashet was so easy it felt dishonest.\nOn the other hand, Vashet made it clear that my hand-language was embarrassingly crude. I could get my point across, but what I was doing was, at best, baby talk. At worst, it resembled the rantings of a deranged maniac.\n\u201cRight now you speak like this.\u201d She got to her feet, waved both hands over her head, and pointed to herself with both thumbs. \u201cI want to make good fight.\u201d She gave a wide, insipid grin. \u201cWith sword!\u201d She thumped her chest with both fists, then jumped into the air like an excited child.\n\u201cCome now,\u201d I said, embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019m not that bad.\u201d\n\u201cYou are close,\u201d Vashet said seriously as she sat back down on the bench. \u201cIf you were my son, I would not let you leave the house. As my student, it is only tolerable because you are a barbarian. It\u2019s as if Tempi brought home a dog that can whistle. The fact that you are out of tune stands quite beside the point.\u201d\nVashet made as if she would get to her feet. \u201cThat said, if you are happy speaking like a simpleton, just say the word and we can move to other things. . . .\u201d\nI reassured her I wanted to learn.\n\u201cFirst, you say too much, and you speak too loudly,\u201d she said. \u201cThe heart of Adem is stillness and silence. Our language reflects this.\n\u201cSecond, you must be much more careful with your gestures,\u201d she said. \u201cWith their placement and timing. They modify specific words and thoughts. They do not always reinforce what you say, sometimes they run purposely counter to your surface meaning.\u201d\nShe made seven or eight different gestures in quick succession. All of them said amusement, but each of them was slightly different. \u201cYou must also\n \ncome to understand the fine shades of meaning. The difference between slim and slender, as my poet king used to say. Right now you only have one smile, and that cannot help but make a person look a fool.\u201d\nWe worked for several hours, and Vashet made clear something Tempi could only hint at. Aturan was like a wide, shallow pool; it had many words, all very specific and precise. Ademic was like a deep well. There were fewer words, but they each had many meanings. A well-spoken sentence in Aturan is a straight line pointing. A well-spoken sentence in Adem is like a spiderweb, each strand with a meaning of its own, a piece of something greater, more complex.\nI arrived in the dining hall for supper in a considerably better mood than before. My welts still stung, but my fingers told me the swelling on my cheek was much reduced. I still sat alone, but I didn\u2019t keep my head down as I had before. Instead I watched the hands of everyone around me, trying to note the subtle shades of difference between excitement and interest, between denial and refusal.\nAfter supper, Vashet brought a small pot of salve which she smeared liberally across my back and upper arms, then more sparingly on my face. It tingled at first, then burned, then settled down to a dull, numb heat. Only after the pain along my back faded did I realize how tense my entire body had been.\n\u201cThere,\u201d Vashet said, twisting the stopper back into the bottle. \u201cHow is that?\u201d\n\u201cI could kiss you,\u201d I said gratefully.\n\u201cYou could,\u201d she said. \u201cBut your lip is swollen, and you would doubtless make a mess of it. Instead, show me your Ketan.\u201d\nI hadn\u2019t stretched, but not wanting to make excuses, I fell into Open Hands and began to move slowly through the rest.\nAs I\u2019ve already mentioned, Tempi usually stopped me when I made the slightest mistake in the Ketan. So when I reached the twelfth position without interruption, I felt rather smug. Then I misplaced my foot badly in Grandmother Gathers. When Vashet said nothing, I realized she was merely watching and withholding judgment until the end. I began to sweat, and\n \ndidn\u2019t stop until I reached the end of the Ketan ten minutes later.\nAfter I\u2019d finished, Vashet stood stroking her chin. \u201cWell,\u201d she said slowly.\n\u201cIt certainly could be worse . . .\u201d I felt a flicker of pride until she continued. \u201cYou could, for instance, be missing a leg.\u201d\nThen she walked in a circle around me, looking me up and down. She reached out to prod at my chest and stomach. She gripped at my upper arm and the thick muscle above my leg. I felt like a suckling pig brought to market.\nLastly she took hold of my hands, turning them over to examine them. She looked pleasantly surprised. \u201cYou never fought before Tempi taught you?\u201d she asked.\nI shook my head.\n\u201cYou have good hands,\u201d she said, her fingers running up my forearms, feeling at the muscles there. \u201cHalf of you barbarians have soft, weak hands from doing nothing. The other half have strong, stiff hands from cutting wood or working behind a plow.\u201d She turned my hands over in her own. \u201cBut you have strong, clever hands with good motion in your wrists.\u201d She looked up at me questioningly. \u201cWhat do you do for a living?\u201d\n\u201cI am a student at the University where I work with fine tools, shaping metal and stone.\u201d I explained. \u201cBut I\u2019m also a musician. I play the lute.\u201d\nVashet looked startled, then burst into laughter. She let my hands fall and shook her head in dismay. \u201cA musician on top of everything else,\u201d she said. \u201cPerfect. Does anyone else know?\u201d\n\u201cWhat does it matter?\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of who I am.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course you\u2019re not. That\u2019s part of the problem.\u201d She drew in a deep breath and let it out again. \u201cOkay. You should know about this as soon as possible. It will save us both trouble in the long run.\u201d She looked me in the eye. \u201cYou\u2019re a whore.\u201d\nI blinked. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cPay attention for a moment. You\u2019re not thick. You must have realized there are huge cultural differences between here and where you grew up in . . .\u201d\n\u201cThe Commonwealth,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re right. The cultural divide between Tempi and myself was huge compared to the other mercenaries from Vintas.\u201d\nShe nodded. \u201cPart of that is because Tempi has fewer wits than tits,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he is as fresh as a baby chick when it comes to making his way in", "the world.\u201d She waved a hand. \u201cAll that aside, you\u2019re right. There are huge differences.\u201d\n\u201cI noticed,\u201d I said. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to have a nudity taboo for one thing. Either that or Tempi is a bit of an exhibitionist.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d be curious how you found that out,\u201d she chuckled. \u201cBut you\u2019re right. Strange as it may seem to you, we have no particular fear of a naked body.\u201d\nVashet looked thoughtful for a moment, then seemed to reach some kind of decision. \u201cHere. It will be simpler to show you. Watch.\u201d\nI watched the familiar Adem impassivity slide over her face, leaving her face blank as new paper. Her voice lost most of its inflection at the same time, shedding its emotional content. \u201cTell me what I mean when I do this,\u201d she said.\nVashet stepped close, making no eye contact. Her hand said, respect. \u201cYou fight like a tiger.\u201d Her face was expressionless, her voice flat and calm. She grabbed hold of the top of my shoulder with one hand, and gripped my arm with the other, giving it a squeeze.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a compliment,\u201d I said.\nVashet nodded and stepped back. Then she changed. Her face grew animated. She smiled and met my eyes. She stepped close to me. \u201cYou fight like a tiger,\u201d she said, her voice glowing with admiration. One of her hands rested on the top of my shoulder while the other slipped around my biceps. She squeezed.\nI was suddenly embarrassed at how close we were standing. \u201cIt\u2019s a sexual advance,\u201d I said.\nVashet stepped away and nodded. \u201cYour folk view certain things as intimate. Naked skin. Physical contact. The nearness of a body. Loveplay. To the Adem, these are nothing remarkable.\u201d\nShe looked me in the eye. \u201cCan you think of a single time you have heard one of us shout? Raise our voice? Or even speak loudly enough we can be overheard?\u201d\nI thought for a moment, then shook my head.\n\u201cThat is because for us, speaking is private. Intimate. Facial expression too. And this . . .\u201d She pressed her fingers to her throat. \u201cThe warmth a voice can make. The emotion it reveals. That is a very private thing.\u201d\n\u201cAnd nothing carries more emotion than music,\u201d I said, understanding. It was a thought too strange for me to cope with all at once.\nVashet nodded gravely. \u201cA family might sing together if they are close. A", "mother might sing to her child. A woman might sing to her man.\u201d A slight flush rose on Vashet\u2019s cheeks as she said this. \u201cBut only if they are very much in love, and very much alone.\n\u201cBut you?\u201d She gestured to me. \u201cA musician? You do this to a whole room full of people. All at once. And for what? A few pennies? The price of a meal?\u201d She gave me a grave look. \u201cAnd you do it again and again. Night after night. With anyone.\u201d\nVashet shook her head in dismay and shuddered a bit, while her left hand unconsciously clenched in rough gestures: Horror, disgust, rebuke. It was rather intimidating getting both sets of emotional signals from her at the same time.\nI fought off the mental image of standing naked on the stage of the Eolian, then moving through the crowd, pressing my body to everyone there. Young and old. Fat and thin. Rich noble and penniless commoner. It was a sobering thought.\n\u201cBut Play Lute is the thirty-eighth position in the Ketan,\u201d I protested. I was grasping at straws and I knew it.\n\u201cAnd Sleeping Bear is twelfth.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cBut you will find no bears here, or lions, or lutes. Some names reveal. The names in the Ketan are meant to hide the truth, that we may speak of it without spilling its secrets to the open air.\u201d\n\u201cI understand,\u201d I said at last. \u201cBut many of you have been out in the world. You yourself speak Aturan beautifully and with much warmth in your voice. Surely you know there is nothing inherently wrong with a person singing.\u201d\n\u201cYou have been out in the world as well,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cAnd surely you know there is nothing inherently wrong with having sex with three people in a row on the broad hearth of a busy inn.\u201d She looked me in the eye pointedly.\n\u201cI imagine the stone would be rather rough. . . .\u201d I said.\nShe chuckled. \u201cVery well, assume they had use of a blanket too. What would you call that person?\u201d\nIf she\u2019d asked me two span ago, when I\u2019d been fresh out of the Fae, I might not have understood her. If I\u2019d stayed with Felurian any longer, it\u2019s entirely possible that having sex on the hearth wouldn\u2019t have seemed odd to me. But I\u2019d been back in the mortal world for a while now....\nA whore, I thought silently to myself. And a cheap and shameless whore to boot. I was glad I hadn\u2019t mentioned Tempi\u2019s desire to learn the lute to", "anyone. How ashamed he must have felt for such an innocent impulse. I thought of a young Tempi wanting to make music but never telling anyone because he knew it was dirty. It broke my heart.\nMy face must have given away quite a bit, because Vashet reached out to grip my hand gently. \u201cI know this is hard for you folk to understand. So much harder because you have never even entertained the possibility of thinking otherwise.\u201d Caution.\nI struggled with everything this implied. \u201cHow do you get your news?\u201d I asked. \u201cWith no troupers wandering from town to town, how do you keep in touch with the outside world?\u201d\nVashet smirked a bit at this, and made a gesture to the windswept landscape. \u201cDoes this seem to be a place that concerns itself overmuch with the turning of the world?\u201d She dropped her arm. \u201cBut it is not so bad as you think. Traveling peddlers are more welcome here than in most places. Tinkers doubly so. And we ourselves travel quite a bit. Those who take the red come and go, bringing news with them.\u201d\nShe laid a reassuring hand on my shoulder. \u201cAnd, occasionally, a rare singer or musician will travel through. But they do not play for a whole town at once. They will visit a single family. Even then, they perform while sitting behind a screen so they cannot be seen. You can tell an Adem musician because when they travel they carry their tall screens on their backs.\u201d Her mouth pursed a bit. \u201cBut even these are not viewed in an entirely favorable light. It is a valuable occupation, but not a respectable one.\u201d\nI relaxed a bit. The thought of a place where no performer was welcome struck me as profoundly wrong, sick even. But a place with strange customs I could understand. Adapting to fit your audience is common as changing costumes to the Edema Ruh.\nVashet continued. \u201cThis is the way of things, and you would do well to accept it sooner rather than later. I say this as a well-traveled woman. I have spent eight years among the barbarians. I have even listened to music in a group of people.\u201d She said this proudly, with a defiant tilt to her head. \u201cI have done it more than once.\u201d\n\u201cHave you ever sung in public?\u201d I asked.\nVashet\u2019s face went stony. \u201cThat is not a polite question to ask,\u201d she said, stiffly. \u201cAnd you will make no friends with it here.\u201d\n\u201cAll I mean,\u201d I said quickly, \u201cis that if you tried it, you might find it is nothing shameful. It is a great joy to everyone.\u201d", "Vashet gave me a severe look and made a hard gesture of refusal and finality. \u201cKvothe, I have traveled much and seen much. Many of the Adem here are worldly. We know of musicians. And, to be completely forthright, many of us have a secret, guilty fascination with them. Much the same way your folk are enamored with the skill of the Modegan courtesans.\u201d\nShe gave me a hard look. \u201cBut for all that, I would not want my daughter to bring one home, if you catch my meaning. Neither would it improve anyone\u2019s opinion of Tempi if others knew he had shared the Ketan with such as you. Keep it to yourself. You have enough to overcome without all Ademre knowing you are a musician on top of everything.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FOURTEEN": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FOURTEEN\nHis Sharp and Single Arrow\nRELUCTANTLY, I TOOK VASHET\u2019S advice. And though my fingers itched for it, I did not bring out my lute that night and fill my small corner of the school with music. I even went so far as to slide my lute case underneath my bed, lest the mere sight of it fill the school with rumor.\nFor several days I did little but study under Vashet. I ate alone and made no attempt to speak with anyone, as I was suddenly self-conscious of my language. Carceret kept her distance, but she was always there, watching me, her eyes flat and angry as a snake\u2019s.\nI took advantage of Vashet\u2019s excellent Aturan and asked a thousand questions that would have been too subtle for Tempi to understand.\nI waited three entire days until I asked her the question that had been slowly smoldering inside me since I\u2019d climbed the foothill of the Stormwal. Personally, I thought this showed exceptional restraint.\n\u201cVashet,\u201d I asked. \u201cDo your people have stories of the Chandrian?\u201d\nShe looked at me, her normally expressive face gone suddenly impassive. \u201cAnd what does this have to do with your hand-talk?\u201d Her hand flickered through several different variations of the gesture that indicated disapproval and reproach.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d I said.\n\u201cDoes it have something to do with your fighting, then?\u201d she asked. \u201cNo,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSurely it relates to the Ketan?\u201d Vashet said. \u201cOr to the Lethani? Or\nperhaps it touches on some subtle shade of meaning you have difficulty grasping in Ademic.\u201d\n\u201cI am merely curious.\u201d\nVashet sighed. \u201cCan I persuade you to focus your curiosity on more pressing matters?\u201d She asked, gesturing exasperated. Firm rebuke.\nI quickly let the matter drop. Not only was Vashet my teacher, she was my only companion. The last thing I wanted to do was irritate her, or give the", "impression that I was less than attentive to her lessons.\nWith that one disappointing exception, Vashet was a sparkling font of\ninformation. She answered my endless questions quickly and clearly. As a result, I couldn\u2019t help but feel that my skill in speaking and fighting was progressing in great leaps and bounds.\nVashet did not share my enthusiasm, and was not bashful about saying so. Eloquently. In two languages.\nVashet and I were down in the hidden valley that contained the sword tree. We had been practicing our hand fighting for about an hour, and were now sitting in the long grass, catching our breath.\nRather, I was catching my breath. Vashet was not winded at all. Fighting me was nothing to her, and there was no time when she couldn\u2019t chide me for sloppiness by reaching lazily past my defenses to cuff me on the side of the head.\n\u201cVashet,\u201d I said, mustering the courage to ask a question that had been bothering me for some time. \u201cMay I ask a question that is perhaps presumptuous?\u201d\n\u201cI prefer a presumptuous student,\u201d she said. \u201cI had hoped we were beyond the point of worrying about such things.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is the purpose of all of this?\u201d I gestured between the two of us.\n\u201cThe purpose of this,\u201d she mimicked my gesture, \u201cis to teach you enough so that you no longer fight like a little boy, drunk on his mother\u2019s wine.\u201d\nToday her sandy hair was tied in two short braids that hung down her back on either side of her neck. This made her look oddly girlish, and had not done wonders for my self-esteem over the last hour as she had repeatedly thrown me to the ground, forced me into submission, and struck me with countless solid but generously pulled punches and kicks.\nAnd once, laughing, she had stepped easily behind me and slapped me firmly on the ass, as if she were a lecherous taproom drunk and I some low- bodiced serving girl.\n\u201cBut why?\u201d I asked. \u201cTo what purpose are you teaching me? If Tempi was wrong to teach me, why continue to teach me more?\u201d\nVashet nodded approvingly. \u201cI\u2019ve been wondering how long it would take\n \nyou to ask that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt should have been one of your first questions.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been told I ask too many questions,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to step\na little more carefully here.\u201d\nVashet sat forward, suddenly businesslike. \u201cYou know things you should\nnot. Shehyn does not mind that you know of the Lethani, though others feel differently. But there is agreement on the subject of our Ketan. It is not for barbarians. It is only for the Adem, and only for those who follow the path of the sword tree.\u201d\nVashet continued, \u201cShehyn\u2019s thought is thus. If you were part of the school, you would be part of Ademre. If you are part of Ademre, you are no longer a barbarian. And if you are no longer a barbarian, it would not be wrong for you to know these things.\u201d\nIt had a certain convoluted logic to it. \u201cThat also means Tempi would not be wrong for teaching me.\u201d\nShe nodded. \u201cExactly. Instead of bringing home an unwanted puppy, it would be as if he had returned a lost lamb to the fold.\u201d\n\u201cMust I be a lamb or a puppy?\u201d I sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s undignified.\u201d\n\u201cYou fight as a puppy fights,\u201d she said. \u201cEager and clumsy.\u201d\n\u201cBut aren\u2019t I already part of the school?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou are teaching me,\nafter all.\u201d\nVashet shook her head. \u201cYou sleep in the school and eat our food, but that\ndoes not make you a student. Many children study the Ketan with hopes of entering the school and someday wearing the red. They live and study with us. They are in the school, but not of the school, if you follow me.\u201d\n\u201cIt seems odd to me that so many want to become mercenaries,\u201d I said as gently as possible.\n\u201cYou seem eager enough,\u201d she said with an edge to her voice.\n\u201cI am eager to learn,\u201d I said, \u201cnot take the life of a mercenary. I mean no offense.\u201d\nVashet stretched her neck, working out some stiffness. \u201cIt is your language getting in the way. In the barbarian lands, mercenaries are the lowest rung of society. No matter how thick or useless a man might be, he can carry a cudgel and earn a ha\u2019penny a day guarding a caravan. Am I right?\u201d\n\u201cThe lifestyle does tend to attract a rough sort of person,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWe are not mercenaries of that kind. We are paid, but we choose which jobs we take.\u201d She paused. \u201cIf you fight for your purse, you are a mercenary. What are you called if you fight out of duty for your country?\u201d", "\u201cA soldier.\u201d\n\u201cIf you fight for the law?\u201d\n\u201cA constable or a bailiff.\u201d\n\u201cIf you fight for your reputation?\u201d\nI had to think a bit on that one. \u201cA duelist, perhaps?\u201d\n\u201cIf you fight for the good of others?\u201d\n\u201cAn Amyr,\u201d I said without thinking.\nShe cocked her head at me. \u201cThat is an interesting choice,\u201d she said. Vashet held up her arm, displaying the red sleeve proudly. \u201cWe Adem are\npaid to guard, to hunt, to protect. We fight for our land and our school and our reputations. And we fight for the Lethani. With the Lethani. In the Lethani. All of these things together. The Adem word for one who takes the red is Cethan.\u201d She looked up at me. \u201cAnd it is a very proud thing.\u201d\n\u201cSo becoming a mercenary is quite high on the Adem social ladder,\u201d I said.\nShe nodded. \u201cBut barbarians do not know this word, and wouldn\u2019t understand even if they did. So \u2018mercenary\u2019 must suffice.\u201d\nVashet pulled two long strands of grass from the ground and began to twist them together into a cord. \u201cThis is why Shehyn\u2019s decision is not an easy one to make. She must balance what is right against what is best for her school. All the while taking into consideration the good of the entire path of the sword tree. Rather than make a rash decision, she is playing a more patient game. Personally, I think she\u2019s hoping the problem will take care of itself.\u201d\n\u201cHow would this take care of itself?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cYou could have run off,\u201d she said simply. \u201cMany assumed you would. If I\u2019d decided you were not worth teaching, that would have taken it out of her hands as well. Or you could die during your training, or become crippled.\u201d\nI stared at her.\nShe shrugged. \u201cAccidents happen. Not often, but sometimes. If Carceret had been your teacher . . .\u201d\nI grimaced. \u201cSo how does one officially become a member of the school? Is there some sort of test?\u201d\nShe shook her head, \u201cFirst, someone must stand on your behalf, saying you are worthy of joining the school.\u201d\n\u201cTempi?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cSomeone of consequence,\u201d she clarified.\n\u201cSo that would be you,\u201d I said slowly.\nVashet grinned, tapping the side of her crimped nose, then pointing at me.", "\u201cOnly took you two guesses. If you ever progress to the point I feel you won\u2019t embarrass me, I\u2019ll stand on your behalf and you can take the test.\u201d\nShe continued to twist the blades of grass together, her hands moving in a steady, complicated pattern. I\u2019d never seen another Adem idly toy with something like this while talking. They couldn\u2019t, of course. They needed one hand free to talk. \u201cIf you pass this test, you are no longer a barbarian. Tempi is vindicated, and everyone goes home happy. Except for those who aren\u2019t, of course.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t pass this test?\u201d I asked. \u201cOr what if you decide I\u2019m not good enough to take it?\u201d\n\u201cThen things grow complicated.\u201d She came to her feet. \u201cCome, Shehyn has asked to speak with you today. It would not be polite of us to be late.\u201d\nVashet led the way back to the small cluster of low stone buildings. When I\u2019d first seen them I\u2019d assumed they were the town itself. Now I knew they composed the school. The group of buildings was like a tiny University, except there was none of the scheduled regimen I was used to.\nThere was no formal ranking system, either. Those with their reds were treated with deference, and Shehyn was obviously in charge. Other than that, all I had was a vague impression of a social pecking order. Tempi was obviously rather low and not well-thought-of. Vashet was rather high and respected.\nWhen we arrived for our meeting, Shehyn was midway through performing the Ketan. I watched silently as she moved at the speed of honey spreading on a tabletop. The Ketan grows more difficult the slower it is done, but she performed it flawlessly.\nIt took her half an hour to finish, after which she opened a window. A curl of wind brought in the sweet smell of summer grass and the sound of leaves.\nShehyn sat. She wasn\u2019t breathing hard, though a sheen of sweat covered her skin. \u201cDid Tempi tell you of the nine-and-ninety tales?\u201d she asked without preamble. \u201cOf Aethe and the beginning of the Adem?\u201d\nI shook my head.\n\u201cGood,\u201d Shehyn said. \u201cIt is not his place to do such a thing, and he could not do it properly.\u201d She looked at Vashet. \u201cHow is language coming?\u201d\n \n\u201cQuickly, as these things go,\u201d she said. However.\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Shehyn said, switching to precise, slightly accented Aturan. \u201cI will tell it like this, so there will be less interruption, and less room for misunderstanding.\u201d\nI did my best to gesture respectful gratitude.\n\u201cThis is a story of years ago,\u201d Shehyn said formally. \u201cBefore this school. Before the path of the sword tree. Before any Adem knew of the Lethani. This is a story of the beginning of such things.\n\u201cThe first Adem school was not a school that taught sword-work. Surprisingly, it was founded by a man named Aethe who sought mastery over the arrow and the bow.\u201d\nShehyn paused in her tale and gave a word of explanation. \u201cYou should know that in those days, use of the bow was very common. The skill of it was much prized. We were shepherds, and much set on by our enemies, and the bow was the best tool we had to defend ourselves.\u201d\nShehyn leaned back in her chair and continued. \u201cAethe did not set out to found a school. There were no schools in those days. He merely sought to improve his skill. All his will he bent upon this, until he could shoot an apple from a tree one hundred feet away. Then he strove until he could shoot the wick of a burning candle. Soon the only target that challenged him was a piece of hanging silk blowing in the wind. Aethe strove until he could anticipate the turning of the wind, and once he had mastered this thing, he could not miss.\n\u201cStories of his talent spread, and others came to him. Among them was a young woman named Rethe. At first Aethe doubted she possessed the strength to draw the bow. But she was soon regarded as his finest student.\n\u201cAs I have said, this was long years and distant miles from where we sit. In those days, the Adem did not have the Lethani to guide us, and so it was a rough and bloody time. In those days it was not uncommon for one Adem to kill another out of pride, or from an argument, or as a proof of skill.\n\u201cSince Aethe was the greatest of archers, many challenged him. But a body is nothing of a target when one can strike silk blowing in the wind. Aethe slew them easily as cutting wheat. He took only a single arrow with him to a duel, and claimed if that single arrow was not enough, he deserved to be struck down.\n\u201cAethe grew older, and his fame spread. He put down roots and began the first of the Adem schools. Years passed, and he trained many Adem to be", "deadly as knives. It became well known that if you gave Aethe\u2019s students three arrows and three coins, your three worst enemies would never bother you again.\n\u201cSo the school grew rich and famous and proud. And so did Aethe.\n\u201cIt was then that Rethe came to him. Rethe, his best student. Rethe who stood nearest his ear and closest to his heart.\n\u201cRethe spoke to Aethe, and they disagreed. Then they argued. Then they shouted loud enough that all the school could hear it through the thick stone walls.\n\u201cAnd at the end of it, Rethe challenged Aethe to a duel. Aethe accepted, and it was known that the winner would control the school from that day forth.\n\u201cAs the challenged, Aethe chose his place first. He chose to stand among a grove of young and swaying trees that gave him shifting cover. Normally he would not bother with precautions such as this, but Rethe was his finest student, and she could read the wind just as well as he. He took with him his bow of horn. He took with him his sharp and single arrow.\n\u201cThen Rethe chose her place to stand. She walked to the top of a high hill, her outline clear against the naked sky. She carried neither bow nor arrow. And when she reached the top of the hill, she sat calmly on the ground. This was perhaps the oddest thing of all, as Aethe was known to sometimes strike a foe through the leg rather than kill them.\n\u201cAethe saw his student do this, and he was filled with anger. Aethe took his single arrow and fitted it to his bow. Aethe drew the string against his ear. The string Rethe had made for him, woven from the long, strong strands of her own hair.\u201d\nShehyn met my eye. \u201cFull of anger, Aethe shot his arrow. It struck Rethe like a thunderbolt. Here.\u201d She pointed with two fingers at the inner curve of her left breast.\n\u201cStill seated, arrow sprouting from her chest, Rethe drew a long ribbon of white silk from beneath her shirt. She took a white feather from the arrow\u2019s fletching, dipped it in her blood, and wrote four lines of poetry.\n\u201cThen Rethe held the ribbon aloft for a long moment, waiting as the wind pulled first one way, then another. Then Rethe loosed it, the silk twisting through the air, rising and falling on the breeze. The ribbon twisted in the wind, wove its way through the trees, and pressed itself firmly against Aethe\u2019s chest.", "\u201cIt read:\nAethe, near my heart. Without vanity, the ribbon. Without duty, the wind. Without blood, the victory.\nI heard a low noise and looked over to see Vashet weeping quietly to herself. Her head was lowered, and tears ran down her face to drip deeper spots of red onto the front of her shirt.\nShehyn continued. \u201cOnly after Aethe read these lines did he recognize the deep wisdom his student possessed. He hurried to tend Rethe\u2019s wounds, but the head of the arrow was lodged too close to her heart to be removed.\n\u201cRethe lived only three days after that, with the grief-stricken Aethe tending her. He gave her control of the school, and listened to her words, all the while the head of the arrow riding close to her heart.\n\u201cDuring those days, Rethe dictated nine-and-ninety stories, and Aethe wrote them down. These tales were the beginning of our understanding of the Lethani. They are the root of all Ademre.\n\u201cLate in the third day Rethe finished telling the ninety-ninth story to Aethe, who now held himself to be his student\u2019s student. After Aethe finished writing, Rethe said to him, \u2018There is one final story, more important than all the rest, and that one shall be known when I awake.\u2019\n\u201cThen Rethe closed her eyes and slept. And sleeping, she died.\n\u201cAethe lived forty years after that, and it is said he never killed again. In the years that followed, he was often heard to say, \u2018I won the only duel I ever lost.\u2019\n\u201cHe continued to run the school and train his students to be masters of the bow. But now he also trained them to be wise. He told them the nine-and- ninety tales, and thus it was the Lethani first came to be known by all Ademre. And that is how we came to be that which we are.\u201d\nThere was a long pause.\n\u201cI thank you, Shehyn,\u201d I said doing my best to gesture respectful gratitude.\u201cI would very much like to hear these nine-and-ninety stories.\u201d\n\u201cThey are not for barbarians,\u201d she said. But she didn\u2019t seem offended at my request, gesturing a combination of reproach and regret. She changed the subject. \u201cHow is your Ketan coming?\u201d", "\u201cI struggle to improve, Shehyn.\u201d\nShe turned to Vashet. \u201cDoes he?\u201d\n\u201cThere is certainly struggle,\u201d Vashet said, her eyes still red with tears. Wry\namusement. \u201cBut there is improvement, too.\u201d\nShehyn nodded. Reserved approval. \u201cSeveral of us will be fighting\ntomorrow. Perhaps you could bring him to watch.\u201d\nVashet made an elegant motion that made me appreciate how little I knew\nof the subtleties of hand-language: Gracious thankful slightly submissive acceptance.\n\u201cYou should be flattered,\u201d Vashet said cheerfully. \u201cA conversation with Shehyn and an invitation to watch her fight.\u201d\nWe were making our way back to a sheltered box valley where we typically practiced the Ketan and our hand fighting.\nHowever, my mind kept spinning back to several unavoidable and unpleasant thoughts. I was thinking about secrets and how people longed to keep them. I wondered what Kilvin would do if I brought someone into the Fishery and showed them the sygaldry for blood and bone and hair.\nThe thought of the big artificer\u2019s anger was enough to make me shiver. I knew the sort of trouble I would face. That was clearly laid out in the University\u2019s laws. But what would he do to the person I had taught these things to?\nVashet slapped my chest with the back of her hand to get my attention. \u201cI said you should be flattered,\u201d she repeated.\n\u201cI am,\u201d I said.\nShe took hold of my shoulder, turning me to face her. \u201cYou\u2019ve gone all pensive on me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat will be done with Tempi if all of this ends badly?\u201d I asked bluntly.\nHer cheerful expression faded. \u201cHis reds will be taken away, and his sword, and his name, and he will be cut away from the Latantha.\u201d She drew a slow breath. \u201cIt is unlikely any other school would take him after such a thing, so this would effectively exile him from all Ademre.\u201d\n\u201cBut exile won\u2019t work for me,\u201d I said. \u201cForcing me back into the world would only make the problem worse, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\n \nVashet didn\u2019t say anything.\n\u201cWhen all of this started,\u201d I said. \u201cYou encouraged me to leave. If I had run, would I have been allowed to go?\u201d\nThere was a long silence that told me the truth of it. But she said it aloud, too. \u201cNo.\u201d\nI appreciated not being lied to about it. \u201cAnd what is my punishment to be?\u201d I asked. \u201cImprisonment?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cNo. It\u2019s not practical to keep me locked up here for years.\u201d I looked up at her. \u201cSo what?\u201d\n\u201cPunishment is not our concern,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are a barbarian, after all. You did not know you were doing anything wrong. The main concern is to prevent you from teaching others what you have stolen, to keep you from using it to your own profit.\u201d\nShe hadn\u2019t answered my question. I gave her a long look.\n\u201cSome say killing you would be the best way,\u201d she said frankly. \u201cBut most believe killing is not in keeping with the Lethani. Shehyn is among these. As am I.\u201d\nI relaxed slightly, that was something at least. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t suppose a promise on my part would reassure anyone?\u201d\nShe gave me a sympathetic smile. \u201cIt speaks well of you that you came back with Tempi. And you stayed when I tried to drive you away. But the promise of a barbarian amounts for little in this.\u201d\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d I asked, suspecting the answer and knowing I wasn\u2019t going to like it.\nShe took a deep breath. \u201cYou could be prevented from teaching by removing your tongue or putting out your eyes,\u201d she said frankly. \u201cTo keep you from using the Ketan you might be hobbled. Your ankle tendon cut, or the knee of your favored leg lamed.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cBut one can still be a good fighter even with a damaged leg. So it would be more effective to remove the two smallest fingers from your right hand. This would be . . .\u201d\nVashet kept speaking in her matter-of-fact tone. I think she intended it to be reassuring, calming. But it had the opposite effect. All I could think of was her cutting off my fingers as calmly as you would pare away a piece of apple. Everything grew bright around the edges of my vision, and the vivid mental picture made my stomach roll over. I thought for a moment I might be sick.\nThe light-headedness and nausea passed. As I came to my senses, I realized Vashet had finished talking and was staring at me.\nBefore I could say anything, she waved a hand dismissively. \u201cI see I will", "get no more use of you today. Take the rest of the evening for yourself. Get your thoughts in order or practice the Ketan. Go watch the sword tree. Tomorrow we will continue.\u201d\nI walked aimlessly for a while, trying not to think about my fingers being cut away. Then, coming over a hill, I stumbled almost literally onto a naked Adem couple tucked away in a grove of trees.\nThey didn\u2019t scramble for their clothes when I burst out of the trees, and rather than try to apologize with my poor language and fuddled wits, I simply turned and left, face burning with embarrassment.\nI tried to practice the Ketan but couldn\u2019t keep my mind on it. I went to watch the sword tree, and for a while the sight of it moving gracefully in the wind calmed me. Then my mind drifted and I was confronted with the image of Vashet paring off my fingers again.\nI heard the three high bells and went to dinner. I was standing in line, half stupid with the mental effort of not thinking of someone maiming my hands, when I noticed the Adem standing nearby were staring at me.A young girl of about ten wore an expression of open amazement on her face, and a man in his mercenary reds looked at me as if he had just seen me wipe my ass with a piece of bread and eat it.\nOnly then did I realize I was humming. Not loud, exactly, but loud enough for those nearby to hear. I couldn\u2019t have been doing it for long, as I was only six lines into \u201cLeave the Town, Tinker.\u201d\nI stopped, then lowered my eyes, took my food, and spent ten minutes trying to eat. I managed a few bites, but that was all. Eventually I gave up and headed to my room.\nI lay in bed, running through the options in my mind. How far could I run? Could I lose myself in the surrounding countryside? Could I steal a horse? Had I even seen a horse since I\u2019d been in Haert?\nI brought out my lute and practiced my chording a bit, all five of my clever fingers flicking up and down the long neck of the lute. But my right hand ached to strum and pick notes from the strings. It was as frustrating as trying to kiss someone using only one lip, and I soon gave up.\nAt last I brought out my shaed and wrapped it around myself. It was warm\n \nand comforting. I drew the hood over my head as far as it would go and thought of the dark piece of Fae where Felurian had gathered its shadows.\nI thought of the University, of Wil and Sim. Of Auri and Devi and Fela. I had never been popular at the University, and my circle of friends had never seemed particularly large. But the truth was I\u2019d simply forgotten what it was like to be truly alone.\nI thought of my family then. I thought of the Chandrian, of Cinder. His fluid grace. His sword held easy in his hand like a piece of winter ice. I thought of killing him.\nI thought of Denna and what the Cthaeh had told me. I thought of her patron and the things I had said during our fight. I thought about the time she had slipped on the road and I had caught her, how the gentle curve above her hip had felt against my hand. I thought about the shape of her mouth, the sound of her voice, the smell of her hair.\nAnd, eventually, I stepped softly through the doors of sleep.", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN\nStorm and Stone\nI WOKE THE NEXT MORNING knowing the truth. My only way out of this situation was through the school. I needed to prove myself. That meant I needed everything Vashet could teach me as quickly as possible.\nSo the next morning I rose in the pale blue light of dawn. And when Vashet emerged from her small stone house I was waiting for her. I was not particularly bright-eyed or bushy-tailed, as my sleep had been filled with troubling dreams, but I was ready to learn.\nI realize now that I may have given an inaccurate impression of Haert.\nIt was no thriving metropolis, obviously. And it couldn\u2019t be considered a\ncity by any stretch of the imagination. In some ways it was barely a town. I do not say this disparagingly. I spent the majority of my young life\ntraveling with my troupe, moving from small town to small town. Half the world is made of tiny communities that have grown up around nothing more than a crossroads market, or a good clay pit, or a bend of river strong enough to turn a mill wheel.\nSometimes these towns are prosperous. Some have rich soil and generous weather. Some thrive on the trade moving through them. The wealth of these places is obvious. The houses are large and well-mended. People are friendly and generous. The children are fat and happy. There are luxuries for sale: pepper and cinnamon and chocolate. There is coffee and good wine and music at the local inn.\nThen there are the other sort of towns. Towns where the soil is thin and tired. Towns where the mill burned down, or the clay was mined out years ago. In these places the houses are small and badly patched. The people are lean and suspicious, and wealth is measured in small, practical ways. Cords\n \nof firewood. A second pig. Five jars of blackberry preserve.\nAt first glance, Haert seemed to be this sort of town. It was little more than\ntiny homes, broken stone, and the occasional penned goat.\nIn most parts of the Commonwealth, or anywhere in the Four Corners for\nthat matter, a family living in a small cottage with only a few sticks of furniture would be viewed as unfortunate. One step away from paupers.\nBut while most of the Adem homes I had seen were relatively small, they weren\u2019t the same sort you would find in a desperate Aturan town, made of sod and logs chinked with mud.\nThe Adem homes were all snug stone, fit together as cunningly as anything I had ever seen. There were no cracks letting in the endless wind. No leaking roofs. No cracking leather hinges on the doors. The windows weren\u2019t oiled sheepskin or empty holes with wooden shutters. They were fitted glass, tight as any you\u2019d find in a banker\u2019s manor.\nI never saw a fireplace in all my time in Haert. Don\u2019t get me wrong, fireplaces are better than freezing to death by a long step. But most of the rough ones folk can build for themselves out of loose fieldstone or cinder- brick are drafty, dirty, and inefficient. They fill your house with soot and your lungs with smoke.\nInstead of fireplaces, each Adem home had its own iron stove. The sort of stove that weighs hundreds of pounds. The sort of stove made of thick drop- iron so you can stoke it until it glows with heat. The sort of stove that lasts a century and costs more than a farmer earns from an entire year of hard harvesting. Some of these stoves were small, good for heating and cooking. But I saw more than a few that were larger and could be used for baking too. One of these treasures was tucked away in a low stone house of only three rooms.\nThe rugs on the Adem floors were mostly simple, but they were of thick, soft wool, deeply dyed. The floors beneath those rugs were smooth-sanded wood, not dirt. There were no guttering tallow tapers or reedlights. There were beeswax candles or lamps that burned a clean white oil. And once, through a distant window, I recognized the unwavering red light of a sympathy lamp.\nIt was this last that made me realize the truth. This was not a scattered handful of desperate folk, scratching out a lean existence on the bare mountainside. They were not living hand-to-mouth, eating cabbage soup and living in fear of winter. This community was comfortably, quietly", "prosperous.\nMore than that. Despite the lack of glittering banquet halls and fancy\ngowns, despite the absence of servants and statuary, each of these homes was like a tiny manor house. They were each of them wealthy in a quiet, practical way.\n\u201cWhat did you think?\u201d Vashet said, laughing at me. \u201cThat a handful of us win our reds and run off to lives of mad luxury while our families drink their own bathwater and die of scurvy?\u201d\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t though of it at all, really,\u201d I said, looking around. Vashet was beginning to show me how to use a sword. We had been at it for two hours, and she had done little more than explain the different ways of holding it. As if it were a baby and not a piece of steel.\nNow that I knew what to look for, I could see dozens of the Adem houses worked cunningly into the landscape. Heavy wooden doors were dug into bluffs. Others looked like little more than tumbles of stone. Some had grass growing on their roofs and could only be recognized by the stovepipes peeping out. A fat nanny goat grazed atop one of these, her udder swinging as she stretched out her neck to crop a mouthful of grass.\n\u201cLook at the land around you,\u201d she said, spinning in a slow circle to take in the landscape. \u201cThe ground is too thin for the plow, too jagged for horses. The summer too wet for wheat, too harsh for fruit. Some mountains hold iron, or coal, or gold. But not these mountains. In winter the snow will pile higher than your head. In spring the storms will push you from your feet.\u201d\nShe looked back at me. \u201cThis is our land because no one else wants it.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cOr rather, it became ours for that reason.\u201d\nVashet adjusted her sword on her shoulder, then eyed me speculatively. \u201cSit and listen,\u201d she said formally. \u201cAnd I will tell a story of a time long gone.\u201d\nI sat on the grass, and Vashet took her place on a nearby stone. \u201cLong ago,\u201d she said, \u201cthe Adem were upheaved from our rightful place. Something we cannot remember drove us out. Someone stole our land, or ruined it, or made us flee in fear. We were forced to wander endlessly. Our whole nation mendicant, like beggars. We would find a place, and settle, and rest our\n \nflocks. Then those who lived nearby would drive us off.\n\u201cThe Adem were fierce back then. If we had not been fierce, there would\nbe none of us left today. But we were few, so we were always driven forth. Finally we found this thin and windy place, unwanted by the world. We dug our roots deep into the stone and made it ours.\u201d\nVashet\u2019s eyes wandered the landscape. \u201cBut this land had little to give us, a place for our flocks to graze, stone, and endless wind. We could not find a way to sell the wind, so we sold our fierceness to the world. So we lived, and slowly we sharpened ourselves into the thing we are today. No longer only fierce, but dangerous and proud. Unceasing as the wind and strong as stone.\u201d\nI waited a moment to make sure she was finished. \u201cMy people are wanderers too,\u201d I said. \u201cIt is our way. Nowhere and everywhere is where we live.\u201d\nShe shrugged, smiling. \u201cIt is a story, mind you. And an old one. Take from it what you will.\u201d\n\u201cI am fond of stories,\u201d I said.\n\u201cA story is like a nut,\u201d Vashet said. \u201cA fool will swallow it whole and choke. A fool will throw it away, thinking it of little worth.\u201d She smiled. \u201cBut a wise woman finds a way to crack the shell and eat the meat inside.\u201d\nI got to my feet and walked to where she was sitting. I kissed her hands and her forehead and her mouth. \u201cVashet,\u201d I said. \u201cI am glad Shehyn gave me to you.\u201d\n\u201cYou are a foolish boy.\u201d She looked down, but I could see a faint blush rising on her face as she spoke. \u201cCome. We should go. You do not want to miss the chance to see Shehyn fight.\u201d\nVashet led me to an unmarked piece of meadow where the thick grass had been grazed close to the ground. A few other Adem already stood nearby, waiting. Some folk had brought small stools or rolled pieces of log to use as benches. Vashet simply sat on the ground. I joined her.\nA crowd slowly gathered. Only thirty people or so, but it was the most Adem I\u2019d ever seen together other than in the dining hall. They gathered in twos and threes, moving from one conversation to another. Rarely did a group of five coalesce for any length of time.\n \nThough there were a dozen conversations all within a stone\u2019s throw of me, I couldn\u2019t hear more than a murmur. The speakers stood close enough to touch, and the wind in the grass made more noise than their voices.\nBut I could tell the tone of each conversation from where I sat. Two months ago this gathering would have seemed eerily subdued. A gathering of fidgety, emotionless, near-mutes. But now I could plainly see one pair of Adem were teacher and student by how far apart they stood, by the deference in the younger woman\u2019s hands. The cluster of three red-shirted men were friends, easy and joking as they jostled at each other. That man and woman were fighting. She was angry. He was trying to explain.\nI suddenly wondered how I ever could have thought of these people as restless or fidgety. Every motion was to a purpose. Every shifting of the feet implied a change in attitude. Every gesture spoke volumes.\nVashet and I sat close to each other and kept our voices low, continuing our discussion in Aturan. She explained how each school had standing accounts with the Cealdish moneylenders. That meant far-flung mercenaries could deposit the school\u2019s share of their earnings anywhere people used Cealdish currency, which meant anywhere in the entire civilized world. That money was then tallied to the appropriate account so the school could make use of it.\n\u201cHow much does a mercenary send back to the school?\u201d I asked, curious. \u201cEighty percent,\u201d she said.\n\u201cEight percent?\u201d I asked, holding up all my fingers but two, sure I had\nmisheard.\n\u201cEighty,\u201d Vashet said firmly. \u201cThat is the proper amount, though many\npride themselves on giving more. The same would be true for you,\u201d she said dismissively, \u201cif you stood a fiddler\u2019s chance in hell of ever wearing the red.\u201d Seeing my astonishment, she explained. \u201cIt is not so much, when you think\nof it. For years, the school feeds and clothes you. It gives you a place to sleep. It gives you your sword, your training. After this investment, the mercenary supports the school. The school supports the village. The village produces children who hope to someday take the red.\u201d She made a circle with her finger. \u201cThus all Ademre thrives.\u201d\nVashet gave me a grave look. \u201cKnowing this, perhaps you can begin to understand what you have stolen,\u201d she said. \u201cNot just a secret but the major export of the Adem. You have stolen the key to this entire town\u2019s survival.\u201d\nIt was a sobering thought. Suddenly Carceret\u2019s anger made much better", "sense.\nI caught a glimpse of Shehyn\u2019s white shirt and roughly knitted yellow cap\nthrough the crowd. The scattered conversations grew still, and everyone began to gather into a large, loose circle.\nIt wasn\u2019t just Shehyn fighting today, apparently. The first to fight were two boys a few years younger than myself, neither of them wearing red. They circled each other warily, then fell on each other in a flurry of blows.\nIt was too fast for my eye to follow, and I saw a dozen half-formed pieces of the Ketan scattered and discarded. It finally ended when one boy caught the other\u2019s wrist and shoulder in Sleeping Bear. It was only when I saw the boy twist his opponent\u2019s arm and force him to the ground that I recognized it as the grip Tempi had used in the bar fight in Crosson.\nThe boys separated, and two red-shirted mercenaries came out to talk to them, presumably their teachers.\nVashet leaned her head close to mine. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re very quick,\u201d I said.\nShe looked at me. \u201cBut ...\u201d\n\u201cThey seem rather sloppy,\u201d I said, being careful to speak quietly. \u201cNot at\nfirst, but after they started.\u201d I pointed at one. \u201cHis feet were too close together. And the other kept leaning forward so his balance was off. That\u2019s how he got caught in Sleeping Bear.\u201d\nVashet nodded, pleased. \u201cThey fight like puppies. They are young, and boys. They are full of anger and impatience. Women have less trouble with these things. It\u2019s part of what makes us better fighters.\u201d\nI was more than slightly surprised to hear her say that. \u201cWomen are better fighters?\u201d I asked carefully, not wanting to contradict her.\n\u201cGenerally speaking,\u201d she said matter-of-factly. \u201cThere are exceptions, of course, but as a whole women are better.\u201d\n\u201cBut men are stronger,\u201d I said. \u201cTaller. They have better reach.\u201d\nShe turned to look at me, slightly amused. \u201cAre you stronger and taller than me then?\u201d\nI smiled. \u201cObviously not. But as a whole, you have to admit, men are bigger and stronger.\u201d\nVashet shrugged. \u201cAnd that would matter if fighting were the same as splitting wood or hauling hay. That is like saying a sword is better the longer and heavier it is. Foolishness. Perhaps for thugs this is true. But after taking the red, the key is knowing when to fight. Men are full of anger, so they have", "trouble with this. Women less so.\u201d\nI opened my mouth, then thought of Dedan and closed it.\nA shadow fell over us, and I looked up to see a tall man in his reds\nstanding at a polite distance. He held his hand poised near the hilt of his sword. Invitation.\nVashet gestured back. Gentle regret and refusal.\nI watched as he walked away. \u201cWon\u2019t they think less of you for not fighting?\u201d\nVashet sniffed disdainfully. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to fight,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would only embarrass him and waste my time. He merely wanted to show he was brave enough to fight me.\u201d She sighed and gave me a pointed look. \u201cIt is that sort of foolishness that leads men from the Lethani.\u201d\nThe next match was between two red-shirted mercenaries, and the difference was obvious. Everything was much cleaner and crisper. The two boys had been frantic as sparrows flapping in the dust, but the fights that followed were elegant as dances.\nMany of the bouts were hand fighting. These lasted until one person submitted or was visibly stunned by a blow.\nOne fight stopped immediately when a man bloodied his opponent\u2019s nose. Vashet rolled her eyes at this, though I couldn\u2019t tell if she thought less of the woman for allowing herself to be struck, or the man for being reckless enough to hurt her.\nThere were several bouts with wooden swords, too. These tended to go more quickly, as even a light touch was considered enough for a victory.\n\u201cWho won that one?\u201d I asked. After a quick exchange of clacking swordplay ended with both women scoring hits at the same time.\n\u201cNeither,\u201d she said, frowning.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t they fight again if it was a tie?\u201d I asked.\nVashet frowned at me. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a tie, strictly speaking. Drenn would have\ndied in minutes, struck through the lung. Lasrel would have died in days when the wound in her gut soured.\u201d\n\u201cSo Lasrel won?\u201d\nVashet gave me a look of withering contempt and turned her attention back to the next fight.\nThe tall Adem man who had asked Vashet to fight was bouting with a thin whip of a woman. Strangely, he used a wooden sword while she was barehanded. He won by a narrow margin after catching two solid kicks to the", "ribs.\n\u201cWho won there?\u201d Vashet asked me.\nI could tell she wasn\u2019t looking for the obvious answer. \u201cIt\u2019s not much of a\nvictory,\u201d I said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t even have a sword.\u201d\n\u201cShe is of the third stone and far outstrips him as a fighter. It was the only\nway for things to be balanced between them unless he were to bring a companion to fight by his side,\u201d Vashet pointed out. \u201cSo I ask again. Who won?\u201d\n\u201cHe won the bout,\u201d I said. \u201cBut he\u2019ll have some impressive bruises tomorrow. Also, his swings seemed somewhat reckless.\u201d\nVashet turned to look at me. \u201cSo who won?\u201d\nI thought about it for a moment. \u201cNeither,\u201d I decided.\nShe nodded. Formal approval. The gesture warmed me, as everyone facing\nus could see it.\nAt long last, Shehyn stepped into the circle. She had removed her lopsided\nyellow hat, and her greying hair swirled about in the wind. Seeing her among the other Adem, I realized how small she was. She carried herself with such confidence that I had come to think of her as taller, but she barely came up to the shoulder of some of the taller Adem.\nShe carried a straight wooden sword with her. Nothing ornate, but it was carved to have the shape of a hilt and blade. Many of the other practice swords I had seen were barely more than smoothed sticks that gave the impression of being swords. Her white shirt and pants were tied tightly to her body with thin white chords.\nAlongside Shehyn came a much younger woman. She was shorter than Shehyn by an inch or so. Her frame was more delicate, too, her small face and shoulders making her look almost childlike. But the pronounced curve of her high breasts and round hips beneath her tight mercenary reds made it obvious she was no child.\nHer wooden sword was also carved. It was curved slightly, unlike most of the others I had seen. Her sandy hair was braided into a long, narrow plait that hung down to the small of her back.\nThe two of them raised their swords and began to circle each other.\nThe young woman was amazing. She struck so fast I could barely see the motion of her hand, let alone the blade of her sword. But Shehyn brushed it away casually with Drifting Snow, taking half a step in retreat. Then, before Shehyn could respond with an attack of her own, the young woman spun", "away, her long braid swinging.\n\u201cWho is she?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cPenthe,\u201d Vashet said admiringly. \u201cShe is a fury, is she not? Like one of\nour old ancestors.\u201d\nPenthe closed with Shehyn again, feinting and thrusting. She darted in, low\nto the ground. Impossibly low. Her back leg thrust out for balance, not even touching the ground. Her sword arm licked out in front of her, her knee bent so deeply that her entire body was below the level of my head, even though I was sitting cross-legged on the ground.\nPenthe unfurled all this sinuous motion as quickly you can snap your fingers. The tip of her sword came in low under Shehyn\u2019s guard and angled up toward her knee.\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d I asked softly, not even expecting an answer. \u201cYou never showed me that.\u201d But it was just astonished noise. Never in a hundred years could my body do that.\nBut Shehyn somehow avoided the attack. Not leaping away with any sudden motion. Not darting out of reach. She was quick, but that was not the heart of how she moved. Instead she was deliberate and perfect. She was already halfway gone before Penthe\u2019s sword had begun to flick toward her leg. The tip of Penthe\u2019s sword must have come within an inch of her knee. But it was not a close thing. Shehyn had only moved as much as was needed, no more.\nThis time Shehyn did manage to counterattack, stepping forward with Sparrow Strikes the Hawk. Penthe rolled sideways, touched the grass briefly, then pushed herself up off the ground. No, she threw herself away from the ground using only her left hand. Her body snapped like a steel spring, arcing away while her sword licked out twice, driving Shehyn back.\nPenthe was full of passion and fury. Shehyn was calm and steady. Penthe was a storm. Shehyn a stone. Penthe was a tiger and Shehyn a bird. Penthe danced and wove madly. Shehyn turned and took one single perfect step.\nPenthe slashed and spun and whirled and struck and struck and struck....\nAnd then they stopped, the tip of Penthe\u2019s wooden sword pressed to Shehyn\u2019s white shirt.\nI gasped, though not loudly enough to draw any attention. Only then did I realize my heart was racing. My entire body was covered in sweat.\nShehyn lowered her sword, gesturing irritation, admiration, and a mingling of other things I couldn\u2019t identify. She bared her teeth a little in a", "grimace and used her hand to chafe roughly at her ribs where Penthe had struck her. The same way you rub your shin when you bark it against a chair. Horrified, I turned to Vashet. \u201cWill she be the new leader of the school?\u201d I\nasked.\nVashet looked at me, puzzled.\nI gestured to the open circle in front of us where the two women stood\ntalking. \u201cThis Penthe. She\u2019s beaten Shehyn . . .\u201d\nVashet looked at me for a moment, uncomprehending, then burst out in a\nlong, delighted laugh. \u201cShehyn is old,\u201d she said. \u201cShe is a grandmother.You cannot expect her to always win against a limber young thing like Penthe, all full of fire and fresh wind.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d I said. \u201cI see. I thought . . .\u201d\nVashet was kind enough not to laugh at me again. \u201cShehyn is not the head of the school because no one can beat her. What an odd notion. What chaos that would be, everything tipping this way and that, changing with the luck of one fight or another.\u201d\nShe shook her head. \u201cShehyn is the head because she is a marvelous teacher, and because her understanding of the Lethani is deep. She is the head because she is wise in the ways of the world, and because she is clever at dealing with troublesome problems.\u201d She tapped me pointedly on the chest with two fingers.\nThen Vashet made a conciliatory gesture. \u201cShe is also an excellent fighter, of course. We would not have a leader who could not fight. Shehyn\u2019s Ketan is without equal. But a leader is not a muscle. A leader is a mind.\u201d\nI looked up in time to see Shehyn approaching. One of the cords holding her sleeve in place had come loose during the fight, and the cloth was fluttering in the wind like a luffing sail. She had donned her lopsided yellow cap again and gestured formal greeting to both of us.\nThen Shehyn turned to me. \u201cAt the end,\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy was I struck?\u201d Curiosity.\nFrantically, I thought back to the final moments of the fight, looking them over in my mind\u2019s eye.\nI tried to gesture with the subtlety Vashet had been teaching me: respectful uncertainty. \u201cYou misplaced your heel slightly,\u201d I said. \u201cYour left heel.\u201d\nShehyn nodded. \u201cGood.\u201d She gestured pleased approval widely enough so anyone who happened to be watching could see it. And, of course, everyone was.", "Giddy with praise, but conscious of the fact I was being watched, I kept my face locked in the proper impassivity as Shehyn walked away with Penthe in tow.\nI leaned my head close to Vashet\u2019s. \u201cI like Shehyn\u2019s little hat,\u201d I said.\nVashet shook her head and sighed. \u201cCome.\u201d She jostled my shoulder with her own and got to her feet. \u201cWe should leave before you spoil the good impression you have made today.\u201d\nThat night at supper, I sat in my customary place at the corner of one table by the wall farthest from the food. Since no one was willing to sit within ten feet of me, there was no sense my taking up space where people might actually want to sit.\nMy good mood still buoyed me, so I was not surprised when I saw a flicker of red slide into the seat across from me. Carceret again. Once or twice a day she made a point to come close enough to hiss a few words at me. She was overdue.\nBut looking up, I was surprised. Vashet sat across from me. She nodded, her impassive face staring into my astonished one. Then I composed myself, nodded back, and we ate for a while in companionable silence. After we were finished eating, we passed some time pleasantly, speaking softly of small things.\nWe left the dining hall together, and when we stepped into the evening air, I switched back into Aturan so I could properly articulate something I\u2019d been thinking for several hours.\n\u201cVashet,\u201d I said. \u201cIt occurs to me it would be nice to fight someone whose ability is somewhat closer to my own.\u201d\nVashet laughed, shaking her head. \u201cThat is like throwing two virgins into a bed. Enthusiasm, passion, and ignorance are not a good combination. Someone is likely to get hurt.\u201d\n\u201cI hardly think it\u2019s fair to call my fighting virginal,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not near your level, but you yourself said my Ketan is remarkably good.\u201d\n\u201cI said your Ketan was remarkably good considering the amount of time you have been studying,\u201d she corrected me. \u201cWhich is less than two months. Which is no time at all.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating,\u201d I admitted. \u201cIf I strike a blow against you, it\u2019s because you let me. There is no substance to it. You\u2019ve given it to me. I haven\u2019t earned it for myself.\u201d\n\u201cAny strike or throw you make against me is earned,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if I offer it to you. But I understand. There is something to be said for honest competition.\u201d\nI started to say something else, but she put her hand over my mouth. \u201cI\u2019ve said I understand. Stop fighting after you have won.\u201d Hand still over my mouth, she tapped a finger thoughtfully. \u201cVery well. Continue your progress and I will find you someone at your own level to fight.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN\nHeight\nI WAS ALMOST BEGINNING TO feel comfortable in Haert. My language was improving and I felt less isolated now that I was able to exchange brief pleasantries with others. Vashet occasionally shared meals with me, helping me feel like slightly less of a pariah.\nWe had done sword-work this morning, which meant an easy start to the day. Vashet was still showing me how the sword was incorporated into the Ketan, and the moments we fought were few and far between. After a few hours of this, we worked on my Ademic, then more sword-work.\nAfter lunch, we moved on to hand fighting. I couldn\u2019t help but feel that here, at least, I was progressing well. After half an hour, not only was Vashet breathing harder, but she began to sweat a bit. I was still no sort of challenge to her, of course, but after days of humiliating nonchalance on her part, she was finally having to put forth a shred of effort to keep ahead of me.\nSo we continued to fight, and I noticed that\u2014How can I say this delicately ? She smelled wonderful. Not like perfume or flowers or anything like that. She smelled like clean sweat and oiled metal and crushed grass from when I\u2019d thrown her to the ground some time before. It was a good smell. She . . .\nI can\u2019t describe this delicately, I suppose. What I mean to say is that she smelled like sex. Not as if she\u2019d been having it, as if she was made of it. When she came in close to grapple me, the smell of her combined with her body pressing against mine ... For a second it was like someone had thrown a switch in my head. All I could think of was kissing her mouth, biting the soft skin of her neck, tearing at her clothes and licking the sweat off her\u2014\nI did none of these things, of course. But at the moment I wanted nothing more. This is embarrassing to look back on, but I will not bother defending myself except to point out that I was in the full flower of my youth, fit and healthy. And she was quite an attractive woman, though ten years my senior.\nAdd to this the simple fact that I had gone from the loving arms of Felurian, to the eager arms of Losine, and from thence to a long, barren", "stretch of training with Tempi as we traveled to Haert. That meant for three span, I had been constantly exhausted, anxious, confused, and terrified by turns.\nNow I was none of these things. Vashet was a good teacher and made sure I was well-rested and relaxed as possible. I was growing more confident in my abilities and more comfortable around her.\nGiven all of this, it\u2019s no great surprise I had the reaction I did.\nAt the time, however, I was startled and embarrassed as only a young man can be. I stepped away from Vashet, blushing and fumbling an apology. I tried to hide my obvious arousal, and in doing so only drew more attention to it.\nVashet looked down at what my hands were trying vainly to conceal. \u201cWell then, I suppose I will take that as a compliment and not a curious new avenue of attack.\u201d\nIf a person could die from shame, I would have.\n\u201cWould you like to take care of it yourself?\u201d Vashet asked easily. \u201cOr would you prefer a partner?\u201d\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d I said stupidly.\n\u201cCome now.\u201d She gestured to my hands. \u201cEven if you could keep your mind away from that, it would doubtless throw your balance off.\u201d She gave a low, throaty chuckle. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to tend to it before we continue your lessons. I can leave you to it, or we can find a soft spot and see who can pin the other best two of three.\u201d\nThe casual tone of her voice convinced me I\u2019d misunderstood her. Then she gave me a knowing smirk, and I realized I\u2019d understood her perfectly well.\n\u201cWhere I come from, a teacher and a student would never . . .\u201d I stumbled, trying to think of a polite way to defuse the situation.\nVashet rolled her eyes at me, the exasperated expression looking odd on an Adem face. \u201cDo your teachers and students also never fight? Never talk? Never eat together?\u201d\n\u201cBut this,\u201d I said, \u201cThis . . .\u201d\nShe sighed. \u201cKvothe, you need to remember. You come from a barbarous place. Much of what you grew up thinking is quite wrongheaded and foolish. None of it as much as the strange customs you barbarians have built around your sexplay.\u201d\n\u201cVashet,\u201d I said. \u201cI . . .\u201d", "She cut me off with a sharp gesture. \u201cWhatever you are about to say, I have doubtless heard before from my poet king. But there are only so many hours of light in the day. So I ask you this: are you desirous of sex?\u201d\nI gave a helpless shrug, knowing it would be pointless to deny it. \u201cWould you like to have sex with me?\u201d\nI could still smell her. At that moment, I wanted it more than anything.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cAre you free of disease?\u201d she asked seriously.\nI nodded, too off balance to be startled by the frankness of the question. \u201cVery well then. If I remember correctly, there is a nice patch of moss out\nof the wind not too far from here.\u201d She began to walk up a nearby hill, her fingers working the buckle that fastened her sword\u2019s scabbard over her shoulder. \u201cCome with me.\u201d\nHer memory did serve her well. Two trees arched their branches over a thick bed of soft moss that was snugged up against a small stony bluff, sheltered from the wind by some convenient bushes.\nIt quickly became obvious that what Vashet had in mind was not an afternoon of twining idly in the shade. To say she was businesslike would be a great disservice to her, as Vashet\u2019s laughter always ran very close to the surface. But she was not flirtatious or coy.\nShe stripped off her mercenary reds without the least fanfare or teasing, revealing a few scars, and a body hard and lean and corded with muscle. Which isn\u2019t to say that she wasn\u2019t also round and soft as well. Then she teased me for staring as if I\u2019d never seen a naked woman before, when the truth was I\u2019d simply never seen one standing full naked in the sunlight.\nWhen I didn\u2019t undress fast enough to suit her, Vashet laughed and mocked my bashfulness. Stepping close, she stripped me naked as a plucked chicken, then kissed me on the mouth, her warm skin pressing against the entire front of my body.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never kissed a woman my own height before,\u201d I mused when we stopped for a breath. \u201cIt\u2019s a different experience.\u201d\n\u201cSee how I continue to be your teacher in all things?\u201d she said. \u201cYour next lesson is this: all women are the same height lying down. The same cannot be said for your sort, of course. Too much depends on a man\u2019s mood and his natural gifts.\u201d\nVashet took my hand and brought us both to lie on the soft moss. \u201cThere,\u201d she said. \u201cAs I suspected. Now you are taller than me. Does this set you at", "your ease?\u201d It did.\nI was prepared for things to be awkward after Vashet and I returned from the bushes, and was surprised to find they were nothing of the sort. She did not suddenly grow flirtatious, which I wouldn\u2019t have known how to cope with. Neither did she feel obliged to treat me with any newfound tenderness. This became clear somewhere around the fifth time she managed to lure me off my guard, catch me with Thunder Upward, and throw me roughly to the ground.\nIn all, she acted as if nothing odd at all had happened. Which meant either nothing odd had happened or something very odd had happened and she was pointedly ignoring it.\nWhich meant that everything was lovely, or everything was going terribly wrong.\nLater, as I ate supper alone, I rolled what I knew of the Adem around in my head. No nudity taboo. They didn\u2019t consider physical contact particularly intimate. Vashet had been very casual both before, during, and after our encounter.\nI thought back to the naked couple I had stumbled onto several days ago. They had been startled, but not embarrassed.\nSex was viewed differently here, obviously. But I didn\u2019t know any of the specific differences. That meant I didn\u2019t have the first idea of how to conduct myself properly. And that meant what I was doing was dangerous as walking around blind. More like running blind, really.\nNormally if I had a question about the Adem culture, I asked Vashet. She was my touchstone. But I could imagine too many ways for that conversation to go astray, and her goodwill was all that stood between me and the loss of my fingers.\nBy the time I finished eating, I\u2019d decided it would be best to simply follow Vashet\u2019s lead. She was my teacher, after all.\n \n"], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN\nBarbarian Cunning\nTHE DAYS PASSED QUICKLY, as days tend to do when there is much to fill them. Vashet continued to teach me, and I turned the whole of my attention toward being a clever and attentive student.\nOur amorous encounters continued, punctuating my training. I never initiated them directly, but Vashet could tell when I was unproductively distracted and was quick to pull me down into the bushes. \u201cIn order to clear your foolish barbarian head,\u201d as she said.\nBefore and afterward I still found these encounters troubling. During, however, I was far from anxious. Vashet seemed to enjoy herself as well.\nThat said, she didn\u2019t seem the least interested in much of what I had learned from Felurian. She had no interest in playing ivy, and while she did enjoy thousand hands, she had little patience for it, and it usually ended up being more like seventy-five hands. Generally speaking, as soon as we had caught our breath, Vashet was tying on her mercenary reds and reminding me that if I kept forgetting to turn my heel out, I would never be able to hit any harder than a boy of six.\nNot all my time was spent training with Vashet. When she was busy, she set me to practice the Ketan, consider the Lethani, or watch the other students spar.\nThere were a few afternoons or evenings when Vashet simply sent me on my way. So I explored the surrounding town and discovered Haert was much larger than I\u2019d originally assumed. The difference was that all its houses and shops weren\u2019t huddled together in a knot. They were scattered over several square miles of rocky hillside.\nI found the baths early on. By which I mean, I was pointedly directed there\n \nby Vashet with instructions to wash off my barbarian stink.\nThey were a marvel. A sprawling stone building built on the top of what I\nguessed was either a natural hot spring or some marvelously engineered plumbing. There were large rooms full of water and small rooms full of steam. Rooms with deep pools for soaking, and rooms with great brass tubs for scrubbing. There was even one room with a pool big enough for swimming.\nAll through the building, the Adem mingled without any regard for age, gender, or state of undress. This didn\u2019t surprise me nearly as much as it would have a month ago, but it still took a great deal of getting used to.\nAt first I found it hard not to stare at the breasts of the naked women. Then, when some of that novelty faded, I found it hard not to stare at the scars that crossed the bodies of mercenaries. It was easy to tell who had taken the red even when their clothes were off.\nRather than fight my urge to gawk, I found it easier to go early in the morning or late at night when the baths were largely empty. Coming and going at odd hours wasn\u2019t difficult, as there was no lock on the door. It was open at all hours for anyone to use. Soap and candles and towels were available for the taking. The baths, Vashet told me, were maintained by the school.\nI found the smithy by following the noise of ringing iron. The man working there was pleasantly talkative. He was glad to show me his tools and tell me the names for them in Ademic.\nOnce I knew to look, I saw there were signs above the doors of the stores. Pieces of wood carved or painted to show what was sold inside: bread, herbs, barrel staves.... None of the signs had words, which was fortunate for me, as I had no idea how to read Ademic.\nI visited an apothecary where I was told I was not welcome, and a tailor where I was greeted warmly. I spent some of the three royals I\u2019d stolen to buy two new sets of clothes, as those I had with me were showing their miles. I bought shirts and pants in muted colors after the local fashion, hoping they might help me fit in just a little better.\nI also spent many hours watching the sword tree. At first I did this under Vashet\u2019s direction, but before long I found myself drawn back when I had time of my own to spend. Its motions were hypnotic, comforting. At times it seemed the branches wrote against the sky, spelling the name of the wind.", " True to her word, Vashet found me a sparring partner.\n\u201cHer name is Celean,\u201d Vashet told me over breakfast. \u201cYour first meeting\nwill be at the sword tree at midday. You should take this morning to prepare yourself however you think is best.\u201d\nAt last. A chance to prove myself. A chance to match wits with someone at my own level of skill. A real contest.\nI was at the sword tree early, of course, and when I first saw them approaching, I had a moment of confused panic when I thought the small figure at Vashet\u2019s side was Penthe, the woman who had beaten Shehyn.\nThen I realized it couldn\u2019t be Penthe. The figure approaching with Vashet was short, but the wind revealed a straight, lean body with none of Penthe\u2019s curves. What\u2019s more, the figure wore a shirt of bright cornsilk yellow, not mercenary red.\nI fought down a stab of disappointment, even though I knew it was foolish. Vashet had said she had found a fair fight for me. Obviously it couldn\u2019t be someone who had already taken the red.\nThey came closer still, and my excitement guttered and died.\nIt was a little girl. Not even a young girl of fourteen or so. It was a little girl, no more than ten by my best guess. She was skinny as a twig and so short her head barely made it up to my breastbone. Her grey eyes were huge in her tiny face.\nI was humiliated. The only thing that kept me from crying out in protest was the fact that I knew Vashet would find it unspeakably rude.\n\u201cCelean, this is Kvothe,\u201d Vashet said in Ademic.\nThis young girl looked me up and down appraisingly, then took an unconscious half-step closer. A compliment. She considered me enough of a threat that she wanted to be close enough to strike at me if necessary. It was closer than an adult would have stood, because she was shorter.\nPolite greeting, I gestured.\nCelean returned my gesture. It might have been my imagination, but it seemed the angle of her hands implied polite nonsubordinate greeting.\nIf Vashet saw it, she made no comment. \u201cIt is my desire that the two of you fight.\u201d\nCelean looked me over again, her narrow face set in the typical Adem impassivity. The wind blew at her hair, and I could see a half-healed cut", "running from above her eyebrow up into her hairline.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d the girl asked calmly. She didn\u2019t seem afraid. It sounded more as\nif she couldn\u2019t think of the least reason she would want to fight me. \u201cBecause there are things you can learn from each other,\u201d Vashet said.\n\u201cAnd because I say you will.\u201d\nVashet gestured to me: Attend. \u201cCelean\u2019s Ketan is quite exceptional. She\nhas years of experience, and is easily the match of any two girls her size.\u201d Vashet tapped Celean on the shoulder twice. Caution. \u201cKvothe, on the\nother hand, is new to the Ketan and has much to learn. But he is stronger than you, and taller, with a better reach. He also possesses a barbarian\u2019s cunning.\u201d\nI looked at Vashet, unsure if she were poking fun at me or not.\n\u201cAlso,\u201d Vashet continued to Celean, \u201cyou will very likely have your mother\u2019s height when you are grown, so you should practice fighting those larger than yourself.\u201d Attend. \u201cLastly, he is new to our language, and for this you will not mock him.\u201d\nThe girl nodded. I noticed Vashet hadn\u2019t specified I couldn\u2019t be mocked for other reasons.\nVashet straightened and spoke formally. \u201cNothing with the intention to injure.\u201d She held up fingers, marking the rules she had taught me when we started hand fighting. \u201cYou may strike hard, but not viciously. Be careful of the head and neck, and nothing at all toward the eyes. You are each responsible for the other\u2019s safety. If one of you gains a solid submission against the other, do not attempt to break it. Signal fairly and count it the end of the bout.\u201d\n\u201cI know this,\u201d Celean said. Irritation.\n\u201cIt bears repeating,\u201d Vashet said. Stern rebuke. \u201cLosing a fight is forgivable. Losing your temper is not. This is why I have brought you here instead of some little boy. Did I choose wrongly?\u201d\nCelean looked down. Apologetic regret. Embarrassed acceptance.\nVashet addressed us both. \u201cInjuring another through carelessness is not of the Lethani.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t see how my beating up a ten-year-old girl was of the Lethani either, but I knew better than to say so.\nAnd with that, Vashet left us alone, walking to a stone bench some forty feet away where another woman in mercenary reds was sitting. Celean made a complicated gesture I didn\u2019t recognize toward Vashet\u2019s back.\nThen the young girl turned to face me, looking me up and down. \u201cYou are", "the first barbarian I have fought,\u201d she said after a long moment. \u201cAre you all red?\u201d She lifted her hand to her own hair to clarify her meaning.\nI shook my head. \u201cNot many of us.\u201d\nShe hesitated, then reached out her hand. \u201cCan I touch it?\u201d\nI almost smiled at this, but caught myself. I ducked my head a bit and bent\ndown so she could reach.\nCelean ran her hand through my hair, then rubbed some between her\nthumb and forefinger. \u201cIt\u2019s soft.\u201d She gave a little laugh. \u201cBut it looks like metal.\u201d\nShe let go of my hair and stepped back to a formal distance again. She gestured polite thanks, then brought up her hands. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d\nI nodded uncertainly, bringing up my own hands.\nI wasn\u2019t ready. Celean darted forward, catching me flat-footed. Her arm drove out in a punch straight toward my groin. Raw instinct made me crouch so it struck my stomach instead.\nLuckily, by this point I knew how to take a punch, and a month of hard training had made my stomach a sheet of muscle. Still, it felt like someone had thrown a rock at me, and I knew I\u2019d have a bruise by dinner.\nI got my feet under me and flicked an exploratory kick at her. I wanted to see how skittish she was, and hoped to make her back away so I could get my balance settled and make better use of my longer reach.\nIt turned out Celean wasn\u2019t skittish at all. She didn\u2019t back away. Instead she slipped alongside my leg and struck me squarely in the thick knot of muscle directly above the knee.\nBecause of this I couldn\u2019t help but stagger when my foot came back down, leaving me off balance with Celean close enough to climb me if she wanted. She set her hands together, braced her feet, and struck me with Threshing Wheat. The force of it knocked me over backward.\nGiven the thick grass, it wasn\u2019t a hard landing. I rolled to get some distance and came back to my feet. Celean chased me and made Thrown Lightning. She was fast, but I had longer legs, and managed to back away or block everything she threw. She faked a kick and I fell for it, giving her the opportunity to hit me right above the knee in the same place as before.\nIt hurt, but I didn\u2019t stagger this time, instead stepping sideways and away. Still she followed me, relentless and overeager. And in her haste she left an opening.\nBut despite the bruises and the fall she\u2019d already given me, I couldn\u2019t bring", "myself to throw a punch at such a tiny girl. I knew how solidly I could hit Tempi or Vashet. But Celean was such a tiny twig of a thing. I worried I would hurt her. Hadn\u2019t Vashet said we were responsible for each other\u2019s safety?\nSo instead I grabbed her with Climbing Iron. My left hand missed, but the long, strong fingers of my right hand wrapped all the way around her slender wrist. I didn\u2019t have her in the proper submission, but now it was a game of strength, and I couldn\u2019t help but win. I already had her wrist, all that remained was to grip her shoulder and I\u2019d have her in Sleeping Bear before\u2014\nCelean made Break Lion. But it wasn\u2019t the version I had learned. Hers used both hands, striking and twisting so quickly that my hand was stinging and empty before I could think. Then she grabbed my wrist and pulled, lashing out to kick my leg in a fluid motion. I leaned, buckled, and she stretched me out flat above the ground.\nThis landing wasn\u2019t soft, more a jarring flop onto the grass. It didn\u2019t completely stun me, but that didn\u2019t matter because Celean simply reached out and tapped my head twice. Signaling that if she\u2019d wanted to, she could easily have knocked me unconscious.\nI rolled into a sitting position, aching in several places and with a sprained pride. It wasn\u2019t badly sprained though. My time with Tempi and Vashet had taught me to appreciate skill, and Celean\u2019s Ketan truly was excellent.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen that version of Break Lion before,\u201d I said.\nCelean grinned. It was only a small grin, but it still showed a glimpse of her white teeth. In the world of Adem impassivity, it was like the sun coming from behind a cloud. \u201cThat is mine,\u201d she said. Extreme pride. \u201cI made it. I am not strong enough to use regular Break Lion against my mother or anyone your size.\u201d\n\u201cWould you show it to me?\u201d I asked.\nCelean hesitated, then nodded and stepped forward, holding out her hand. \u201cGrab my wrist.\u201d\nI took hold of it, gripping firmly but not fiercely.\nShe did it again, like a magic trick. Both of her hands moved in a flurry of motion, and I was left with a stinging, empty hand.\nI reached out again. Amusement. \u201cI have slow barbarian eyes. Could you make it again so I can learn it?\u201d\nCelean stepped back, shrugging. Indifference. \u201cAm I your teacher? Should I give something of mine to a barbarian who cannot even strike me in a", "fight?\u201d She lifted her chin and looked off toward the spinning sword tree, but her eyes darted back to me, playfully.\nI chuckled and came to my feet, bringing up my hands again.\nShe laughed and turned to face me. \u201cGo!\u201d\nThis time I was ready, and I knew what Celean was capable of. She was no\nsort of delicate flower. She was quick and fearless and aggressive.\nSo I went on the offensive, taking advantage of my long arms and legs. I\nstruck out with Dancing Maiden, but she skipped away. No. It would be better to say she slid away from me, never compromising her balance in the least, her feet weaving smoothly through the long grass.\nThen she changed directions suddenly, catching me between steps and slightly off my stride. She feigned a punch at my groin, then pushed me slightly off balance with Turning Millstone. I staggered but managed to keep my feet beneath me.\nI tried to regain my balance, but she brushed me again with Turning Millstone, then again. And again. Each time only shoving me a few inches, but it kept me in a helpless stumbling retreat until she managed to plant her foot behind mine, tripping me and sending me flat onto my back.\nBefore I\u2019d finished striking the ground she already had hold of my wrist, and soon had my arm tangled firmly in Ivy on the Oak. This pressed my face into the grass while putting uncomfortable pressure against my wrist and shoulder.\nFor a second I considered trying to struggle free, but only for a second. I was stronger than she was, but the whole point of positions like Ivy on the Oak and Sleeping Bear is to put pressure on the fragile parts of the body. You did not need a great deal of strength to attack the branch.\n\u201cI submit,\u201d I said. This is easier to say in Ademic: Veh. An easy noise to make when you are winded, tired, or in pain. I\u2019d become rather used to saying it lately.\nCelean let go of me and stepped away, watching as I sat up.\n\u201cYou really aren\u2019t very good,\u201d she said with brutal honesty.\n\u201cI am not used to striking young girls,\u201d I said.\n\u201cHow could you become used to it?\u201d She laughed. \u201cTo grow used to a\nthing, you must do it over and again. I expect you have never struck a woman even once.\u201d\nCelean extended a hand. I took it in what I hoped was a gracious manner, and she helped pull me to my feet. \u201cI mean where I come from, it is not right", "to fight with women.\u201d\n\u201cI do not understand,\u201d she said. \u201cDo they not let the men fight in the same\nplace as the women?\u201d\n\u201cI mean, for the most part, our women do not fight,\u201d I explained.\nCelean rolled her wrist over, opening and closing her hand as if there were\nsome dirt on the palm and she was absentmindedly trying to rub it off. It was the hand-talk equivalent of puzzlement, a confused frown of sorts. \u201cHow do they improve their Ketan if they do not practice?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cWhere I come from, the women have no Ketan at all.\u201d\nHer eyes narrowed, then brightened. \u201cYou mean to say they have a secret Ketan,\u201d she said, using the Aturan word for \u201csecret.\u201d Though her face was composed, her body vibrated with excitement. \u201cA Ketan only they know, that the men are not allowed to see.\u201d\nCelean pointed over to the bench where our teachers sat ignoring us. \u201cVashet has such a thing. I have asked her to show it to me many times, but she will not.\u201d\n\u201cVashet knows another Ketan?\u201d I asked.\nCelean nodded. \u201cShe was schooled in the path of joy before she came to us.\u201d She looked over at her, her face serious, as if she would pull the secret out of the other woman by sheer force of will. \u201cSomeday I will go there and learn it. I will go everywhere, and I will learn all the Ketans there are. I will learn the hidden ways of the ribbon and the chain and of the moving pool. I will learn the paths of joy and passion and restraint. I will have all of them.\u201d\nWhen she spoke, Celean didn\u2019t say this in a tone of childish fancy, as if she were daydreaming of eating an entire cake. Neither was she boastful, as if she were describing a plan she had put together on her own and thought very clever.\nCelean said it with a quiet intensity. It was almost as if she were simply explaining who she was. Not to me. She was telling herself.\nShe turned back to look at me. \u201cI will go to your land too,\u201d she said. Absolute . \u201cAnd I will learn the barbarian Ketan your women keep secret from you.\u201d\n\u201cYou will be disappointed,\u201d I said. \u201cI did not misspeak. I know the word for secret. What I meant to say is that where I come from, many women do not fight.\u201d\nCelean rolled her wrist again in puzzlement, and I knew I had to be more clear. \u201cWhere I come from, most women spend their whole lives without", "holding a sword. Most grow up not knowing how to strike another with a fist or the blade of their hand. They know nothing of any sort of Ketan. They do not fight at all.\u201d I stressed the last two words with strong negation.\nThat finally seemed to get the point across to her. I had half expected her to look horrified, but instead she simply stood there blankly, hands motionless, as if at a loss for what to think. It was as if I\u2019d just explained to her that the women where I came from didn\u2019t have any heads.\n\u201cThey do not fight?\u201d she asked dubiously. \u201cNot with the men or with each other or with anyone at all?\u201d\nI nodded.\nThere was a long, long pause. Her brow furrowed and I could actually see her struggling to come to grips with this idea. Confusion. Dismay. \u201cThen what do they do?\u201d she said at last.\nI thought of the women I knew: Mola, Fela, Devi. \u201cMany things,\u201d I said, having to improvise around the words I didn\u2019t know. \u201cThey make pictures out of stones. They buy and sell money. They write in books.\u201d\nCelean seemed to relax as I recited this list, as if relieved to hear these foreign women, empty of any Ketan, weren\u2019t strewn around the countryside like boneless corpses.\n\u201cThey heal the sick and mend wounds. They play ...\u201d I almost said play music and sing songs, but caught myself in time. \u201cThey play games and plant wheat and make bread.\u201d\nCelean thought for a long moment. \u201cI would rather do those things and fight as well,\u201d she said decisively.\n\u201cSome women do, but for many it is considered not of the Lethani.\u201d I used the phrase \u201cof the Lethani\u201d because I could not think of how to say \u201cproper behavior\u201d in Ademic.\nCelean gestured sharp disdain and reproach. I was amazed how much more it stung coming from this young girl in her bright yellow shirt than it ever had from Tempi or Vashet. \u201cThe Lethani is the same everywhere,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cIt is not like the wind, changing from place to place.\u201d\n\u201cThe Lethani is like water,\u201d I responded without thinking. \u201cIt is itself unchanging, but it shapes itself to fit all places. It is both the river and the rain.\u201d\nShe glared at me. It was not a furious glare, but coming from one of the Adem, it had the same effect. \u201cWho are you to say the Lethani is like one thing and not another?\u201d", "\u201cWho are you to do the same?\u201d\nCelean looked at me for a moment, the hint of a serious line between her pale eyebrows. Then she laughed brightly and brought up her hands. \u201cI am Celean,\u201d she proclaimed. \u201cMy mother is of the third stone. I am Adem born, and I am the one who will throw you to the ground.\u201d\nShe was as good as her word.", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN\nPurpose\nVASHET AND I FOUGHT, moving back and forth across the foothills of Ademre.\nAfter all this time, I barely noticed the wind anymore. It was as much a part of the landscape as the uneven ground beneath my feet. Some days it was gentle, and did little more than make patterns in the grass or flick my hair into my eyes. Other days it was strong enough to make the loose fabric of my clothes crack and snap against my skin. It could come at you from unexpected directions without a moment\u2019s warning, pushing you as firmly as a hand between your shoulder blades.\n\u201cWhy do we spend so much time on my hand fighting?\u201d I asked Vashet as I made Picking Clover.\n\u201cBecause your hand fighting is sloppy,\u201d Vashet said, blocking me with Fan Water. \u201cBecause you embarrass me every time we fight. And because three times of four you lose to a child half your size.\u201d\n\u201cBut my sword fighting is even worse,\u201d I said as I circled, looking for an opening.\n\u201cIt is worse,\u201d she acknowledged. \u201cThat is why I do not let you fight anyone but me. You are too wild. You could hurt someone.\u201d\nI smiled. \u201cI thought that was the point of this.\u201d\nVashet frowned, then reached out casually to grip my wrist and shoulder, twisting me into Sleeping Bear. Her right hand held my wrist over my head, stretching my arm at an awkward angle, while her left pressed firmly against my shoulder. Helpless, I was forced to bend at the waist, staring at the ground.\n\u201cVeh,\u201d I said in submission.\nBut Vashet didn\u2019t release me. She twisted, and the pressure against my shoulder increased. The small bones of my wrist began to ache.\n\u201cVeh,\u201d I said a little louder, thinking she hadn\u2019t heard me. But still she held me, twisting a little harder at my wrist. \u201cVashet?\u201d I tried to turn my head", "to look at her, but from this angle all I could see was her leg.\n\u201cIf the point of this is to hurt someone,\u201d she said, \u201cwhy should I let you\ngo?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant . . .\u201d Vashet pushed down harder, and I stopped\ntalking.\n\u201cWhat is the purpose of Sleeping Bear?\u201d she asked calmly.\n\u201cTo incapacitate your opponent,\u201d I said.\n\u201cVery well.\u201d Vashet began to bear down with the slow, relentless force of\na glacier. Dull pain began to build in my shoulder as well as my wrist. \u201cSoon your arm will be twisted from the cup of your shoulder. Your tendons will stretch and pull free of the bone. Your muscles will tear and your arm will hang like a wet rag at your side. Then will Sleeping Bear have served its purpose?\u201d\nI struggled a bit out of pure animal instinct. But it only turned the burning pain into something sharper, and I stopped. Over the course of my training, I had been put into inescapable positions before. Every time I had been helpless, but this was the first time I had truly felt that way.\n\u201cThe purpose of Sleeping Bear is control,\u201d Vashet said calmly. \u201cRight now, you are mine to do with as I wish. I can move you, or break you, or let you free.\u201d\n\u201cI would prefer free,\u201d I said, trying to sound more hopeful than desperate.\nThere was a pause. Then she asked, calmly, \u201cWhat is the purpose of Sleeping Bear?\u201d\n\u201cControl.\u201d\nI felt her hands release me, and I stood, slowly rolling my shoulder to ease the ache.\nVashet stood there, frowning at me. \u201cThe point of all of this is control. First you must have control of yourself. Then you can gain control of your surroundings. Then you gain control of whoever stands against you. This is the Lethani.\u201d\nAfter the better part of a month in Haert, I could not help but feel that things were going well. Vashet acknowledged that my language was improving, congratulating me by saying I sounded like a child, rather than just an\n \nimbecile.\nI continued to meet with Celean in the grassy field next to the sword tree. I\nlooked forward to these encounters despite the fact that she thrashed me with cheerful ruthlessness every time we fought. It took three days before I finally managed to beat her.\nThat\u2019s an interesting verse to add to the long story of my life, isn\u2019t it?\nCome listen all, and I will tell\nA tale of brave and daring deeds.\nOf wonders Kvothe the Bloodless wrought, And of the time he bravely fought\nA twigling girl no more than ten.\nAnd listen how it came to pass,\nThe mighty blow he bravely dealt\nThat knocked her sprawling to the grass, And of the glow of joy he felt.\nAwful as it might sound, I was proud. And justifiably so. Celean herself congratulated me when it happened, seeming more than a little surprised that I had managed it. There, in the long shadow of the sword tree, she showed me her two-handed variant of Breaking Lion as a reward, flattering me with the familiarity of an impish grin.\nThat same day we finished our prescribed number of bouts early. I went to sit on a nearby lump of stone that had been smoothed into a comfortable seat. I nursed my dozen small hurts from the fight and prepared to watch the sword tree until Vashet returned to fetch me.\nCelean, however, was not the sort to sit and wait. She skipped over to the sword tree, standing only a few feet from where the longest branches bobbed and danced in the wind, sending the round, razor-sharp leaves turning in wild circles.\nThen she lowered her shoulders and darted under the canopy, in among the thousand madly spinning leaves.\nI was too startled to cry out, but I did come halfway to my feet before I heard her laughing. I watched as she darted and jigged and spun, her tiny body dodging out of the way of the wind-tossed leaves as if she were playing tag. She made it halfway to the trunk and stopped. She ducked her head, reached out, and swatted away a leaf that otherwise would have cut her.", "No. She didn\u2019t just lash out. She used Drifting Snow. Then I watched her move even closer to the trunk, weaving back and forth and protecting herself. First she used Maiden Combs Her Hair, then Dance Backwards.\nThen she skipped to one side, the Ketan abandoned. She crouched and sprinted through a gap in the leaves and made her way to the trunk of the tree, slapping it with one hand.\nAnd she was back among the leaves. She made Pressing Cider, ducked and spun and ran until she was clear of the canopy. She didn\u2019t shout out in triumph as a Commonwealth child might have, but she jumped into the air, hands raised in victory. Then, still laughing, she did a cartwheel.\nBreathless, I watched Celean play her game again and again, moving in and out of the tree\u2019s dancing leaves. She didn\u2019t always make it to the trunk. Twice she scampered back out of the reach of the leaves without making it, and it was obvious even from where I sat that she was angry. Once she slipped and was forced to crawl out under the reach of the leaves.\nBut she made it to the trunk and back four times, each time celebrating her escape with upraised hands, laughter, and a single perfect cartwheel.\nShe only stopped when Vashet returned. I watched from a distance as Vashet stormed over and gave the girl a stern telling off. I couldn\u2019t hear what was said, but their body language spoke volumes. Celean looked down and shuffled her feet. Vashet shook a finger and cuffed the young girl on the side of her head. It was the same scolding any child receives. Stay out of the neighbor\u2019s garden. Don\u2019t tease the Bentons\u2019 sheep. Don\u2019t play tag among the thousand spinning knives of your people\u2019s sacred tree.", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN\nHands\nONCE VASHET JUDGED MY language only moderately embarrassing, she arranged for me to talk with an odd handful of people scattered around Haert.\nThere was a garrulous old man who spun silk thread while chattering endlessly, telling strange, pointless, half-delirious stories. There was a story of a boy who put shoes on his head to keep a cat from being killed, another where a family swore to eat a mountain stone by stone. I could never make any sense of them, but I listened politely and drank the sweet beer he offered me.\nI met with twin sisters who made candles and showed me the steps of strange dances. I spent an afternoon with a woodcutter who spoke for hours of nothing but splitting wood.\nAt first I thought these were important members of the community. I thought Vashet might be parading me in front of them in order to show how civilized I had become.\nIt wasn\u2019t until I spent the morning with Two-fingers that I realized she sent me to each of these people with the hope I would learn something.\nTwo-fingers was not his real name. I\u2019d merely come to think of him as that. He was a cook at the school, and I saw him at every meal. His left hand was whole, but his right was viciously crippled, with only his thumb and forefinger remaining.\nVashet sent me to him in the morning, and together we prepared lunch and talked. His name was Naden. He told me he had spent ten years among the barbarians. What\u2019s more, he had brought more than two hundred and thirty silver talents back into the school before he was injured and could no longer fight. He mentioned the last several times, and I could tell that it was a particular point of pride with him.\nThe bells rang and folk filtered into the dining hall. Naden ladled up the stew we\u2019d made, hot and thick with chunks of beef and carrot. I cut slices of warm white bread for those who wanted it. I exchanged nods and occasional", "polite gestures with those who moved through the line. I was careful to make only the briefest eye contact, and tried to convince myself it was just a coincidence so few people seemed interested in bread today.\nCarceret made a show of her feelings for everyone to see. First she made it to the front of the line, then made a widely visible gesture of abhorrent disgust before walking away, leaving her wooden plate behind.\nLater Naden and I tended to the washing up. \u201cVashet tells me your swordplay is progressing poorly,\u201d he said without preamble. \u201cShe says you fear too much for your hands, and this makes you hesitant.\u201d Firm reproach.\nI froze at the abruptness of it, fighting the urge to stare at his ruined hand. I nodded, not trusting myself to speak.\nHe turned from the iron pot he was scrubbing and held out his hand in front of him. It was a defiant gesture, and his face was hard. I looked then, as ignoring it would be rude. Only his thumb and forefinger remained, enough to grip at things, but not enough for any delicate work. The half of his hand that remained was a mass of puckered scar.\nI kept my face even, but it was hard. In some ways I was looking at my worst fear. I felt very self-conscious of my uninjured hands and fought the urge to make a fist or hide them behind my back.\n\u201cIt has been a dozen years since this hand held a sword,\u201d Naden said. Proud anger. Regret. \u201cI have thought long on that fight where my fingers were lost. I did not even lose them to a skilled opponent. They fell to some barbarian whose hands were better suited to a shovel than the sword.\u201d\nHe flexed his two fingers. In some ways, he was lucky. There were other Adem in Haert who were missing entire hands, or eyes, or limbs to the elbow or knee.\n\u201cI have thought a long time. How could I have saved my hand? I have thought about my contract, protecting a baron whose lands were in rebellion. I think: What if I had not taken that contract? I think: What if I had lost my left hand? I could not talk, but I could hold a sword.\u201d He let his hand drop to his side. \u201cBut holding a sword is not enough. A proper mercenary requires two hands. I could never make Lover out the Window or Sleeping Bear with only one. . . .\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cIt is the luxury of looking backward. You can do it forever, and it is useless. I took the red proudly. I brought over two hundred and thirty talents to the school. I was of the second stone, and I would have made the third in time.\u201d", "Naden held up his ruined hand again. \u201cI could have gained none of these things if I had lived in fear of losing my hand. If I flinched and cringed, I would never have been accepted into the Latantha. Never made the second stone. I would be whole, but I would be less than I am now.\u201d\nHe turned back and began to scrub the pots again. After a moment I joined him.\n\u201cIs it bad?\u201d I asked quietly, unable to help myself.\nNaden didn\u2019t answer for a long moment. \u201cWhen it first happened, I thought to myself it was not so bad. Others have had worse wounds. Others have died. I was luckier than them.\u201d\nHe drew in a deep breath, then let it out slowly. \u201cI tried to think it was not bad. My life would continue on. But no. Life stops. Much is lost. Everything is lost.\u201d\nThen he said, \u201cWhen I dream, I have two hands.\u201d\nWe finished the dishes together, sharing silence between us. Sometimes that is all you can share.\nCelean had a lesson of her own to teach me. Namely that there are opponents who will not hesitate to punch, kick, or elbow a man directly in his genitals.\nNever hard enough to permanently injure me, mind you. She\u2019d been fighting her entire young life and had the control Vashet valued so highly. But that meant she knew exactly how hard to strike to leave me stunned and reeling, making her victory utterly unquestionable.\nSo I sat on the grass, feeling grey and nauseous. After incapacitating me, Celean had given me a comforting pat on the shoulder before skipping blithely away. No doubt going to dance among the wind-tossed branches of the sword tree again.\n\u201cYou were doing well until the end,\u201d Vashet said, lowering herself onto the ground across from me.\nI said nothing. Like a child playing find-and-catch, it was my sincere hope that if I closed my eyes and remained perfectly still, the pain wouldn\u2019t be able to find me.\n\u201cCome now, I saw her kick,\u201d Vashet said dismissively. \u201cIt was not so hard as that.\u201d I heard her sigh. \u201cStill, if you need someone to look at them and\n \nmake sure they are still intact. . . .\u201d\nI chuckled slightly. It was a mistake. Unbelievable pain uncoiled in my\ngroin, radiating down to my knee and up to my sternum. Nausea rolled over me, and I opened my eyes to steady myself.\n\u201cShe will grow out of it,\u201d Vashet said.\n\u201cI should hope so,\u201d I said through gritted teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s a noxious habit.\u201d \u201cThat is not what I meant,\u201d Vashet said. \u201cI mean she will grow taller.\nHopefully then she will distribute her attentions more evenly across the body. Right now she attacks the groin too regularly. It makes her easy to predict and defend against.\u201d She gave me a pointed look. \u201cTo anyone with a shred of wit.\u201d\nI closed my eyes again. \u201cNo lessons right now, Vashet,\u201d I begged. \u201cI\u2019m ready to vomit up yesterday\u2019s breakfast.\u201d\nShe climbed to her feet. \u201cIt sounds like the perfect time for a lesson. Stand up. You should learn how to fight while wounded. This is an invaluable skill Celean has given you the chance to practice. You should thank her.\u201d\nKnowing it was pointless to argue, I climbed to my feet and began to walk gingerly toward my training sword.\nVashet caught me by the shoulder. \u201cNo. Hands only.\u201d\nI sighed. \u201cMust we, Vashet?\u201d\nShe raised an eyebrow at me. \u201cMust we what?\u201d\n\u201cMust we focus always on hand fighting?\u201d I said. \u201cMy swordplay is falling\nfarther and farther behind.\u201d\n\u201cAm I not your teacher?\u201d she asked. \u201cWho are you to say what is best?\u201d \u201cI am the one who will have to use these skills out in the world,\u201d I said\npointedly. \u201cAnd out in the world, I would rather fight with a sword than a fist.\u201d\nVashet lowered her hands, her expression blank. \u201cAnd why is that?\u201d\n\u201cBecause other people have swords,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd if I\u2019m in a fight, I intend to win.\u201d\n\u201cIs winning a fight easier with a sword?\u201d she asked.\nVashet\u2019s outward calm should have warned me I was stepping onto thin conversational ice, but I was distracted by the nauseating pain radiating from my groin. Though honestly, even if I hadn\u2019t been distracted, it\u2019s possible I wouldn\u2019t have noticed. I had grown comfortable with Vashet, too comfortable to be properly careful.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy else carry a sword?\u201d", "\u201cThat is a good question,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy does one carry a sword?\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you carry anything? So you can use it.\u201d\nVashet gave me a look of raw disgust. \u201cWhy do we bother to work on your\nlanguage, then?\u201d She asked angrily, reaching out to grab my jaw, pinching my cheeks and forcing my mouth open as if I were a patient in the Medica refusing my medicine. \u201cWhy do you need this tongue if a sword will do? Tell me that?\u201d\nI tried to pull away, but she was stronger than me. I tried to push her away, but she shrugged my flailing hands away as if I were a child.\nVashet let go of my face, then caught my wrist, jerking my hand up in front of my face. \u201cWhy do you have hands at all and not knives at the ends of your arms?\u201d\nThen she let go of my wrist and struck me hard across the face with the flat of her hand.\nIf I say she slapped me, you will take the wrong impression. This wasn\u2019t the dramatic slap of the sort you see on a stage. Neither was it the offended, stinging slap a lady-in-waiting makes against the smooth skin of a too- familiar nobleman. It wasn\u2019t even the more professional slap of a serving girl defending herself from the unwelcome attention of a grabby drunk.\nNo. This was hardly any sort of slap at all. A slap is made with the fingers or the palm. It stings or startles. Vashet struck me with her open hand, but behind that was the strength of her arm. Behind that was her shoulder. Behind that was the complex machinery of her pivoting hips, her strong legs braced against the ground, and the ground itself beneath her. It was like the whole of creation striking me through the flat of her hand, and the only reason it didn\u2019t cripple me is that even in the middle of her fury, Vashet was always perfectly in control.\nBecause she was in control, Vashet didn\u2019t dislocate my jaw or knock me unconscious. But it made my teeth rattle and my ears ring. It made my eyes roll in my head and my legs go loose and shaky. I would have fallen if Vashet hadn\u2019t gripped me by the shoulder.\n\u201cDo you think I am teaching you the secrets of the sword so you can go out and use them?\u201d she demanded. I dimly realized she was shouting. It was the first time I had ever heard one of the Adem raise their voice. \u201cIs that what you think we are doing here?\u201d\nAs I lolled in her grip, stupefied, she struck me again. This time her hand caught more of my nose. The pain of it was amazing, as if someone had", "driven a sliver of ice directly into my brain. It jolted me out of my daze so I was fully alert when she hit me the third time.\nVashet held me for a moment while the world spun, then let go. I took one unsteady step and crumpled to the ground like a puppet with its strings cut. Not unconscious, but profoundly dazed.\nIt took me a long time to collect myself. When I was finally able to sit up, my body felt loose and unwieldy, as if it had been taken apart and put back together again in a slightly different way.\nBy the time I gathered my wits enough to look around, I was alone.", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY\nKindness\nTWO HOURS LATER I sat alone in the dining hall. My head ached, and the side of my face was hot and swollen. I\u2019d bitten my tongue at some point, so it hurt to eat and everything tasted of blood. My mood was exactly what you might imagine, except worse.\nWhen I saw a red form slide onto the bench across from me, I dreaded looking up. If it was Carceret, it would be bad. But Vashet would be even worse. I had waited until the dining hall was almost empty before coming to eat, hoping to avoid them both.\nBut glancing up, I saw it was Penthe, the fierce young woman who had beaten Shehyn.\n\u201cHello,\u201d she said in lightly accented Aturan.\nI gestured, polite formal greeting. Considering the way my day was going, I thought it best to be as careful as possible. Vashet\u2019s comments led me to believe Penthe was a high-ranking and well-respected member of the school.\nFor all that, she wasn\u2019t very old. Perhaps it was her small frame or her heart-shaped face, but she didn\u2019t look much more than twenty.\n\u201cCould we speak your language?\u201d she asked in Aturan. \u201cIt would be a kindness. I am in need of practice with my talking.\u201d\n\u201cI will gladly join you,\u201d I said in Aturan. \u201cYou speak very well. I am jealous. When I speak Ademic, I feel I am a great bear of a man, stomping around in heavy boots.\u201d\nPenthe gave a small, shy smile, then covered her mouth with her hand, blushing slightly. \u201cIs that correct, to smile?\u201d\n\u201cIt is correct, and polite. A smile such as that shows a small amusement. Which is perfect, as mine was a very small joke.\u201d\nPenthe removed her hand and repeated the shy smile. She was charming as spring flowers. It eased my heart to look at her.\n\u201cNormally,\u201d I said, \u201cI would smile in answer to yours. But here, I worry others would view it as impolite.\u201d", "\u201cPlease,\u201d she said, making a series of gestures wide enough for anyone to see. Bold invitation. Imploring entreaty. Familiar welcome. \u201cI must practice.\u201d\nI smiled, though not quite as widely as I would have ordinarily. Partly out of caution, and partly because my face hurt. \u201cIt feels good to smile again,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI have anxiousness about my smiling.\u201d She started to gesture and stopped herself. Her expression shifted, her eyes narrowing a bit, as if she were irritated.\n\u201cThis?\u201d I asked, gesturing mild worry.\nShe nodded. \u201cHow do you make that with the face?\u201d\n\u201cIt is like this,\u201d I drew my brows together slightly. \u201cAlso, as a woman, you\nwould do this,\u201d I pursed my lips slightly. \u201cI would do this, as I am a man.\u201d I drew my lips down into a small frown instead.\nPenthe looked at me blankly. Aghast. \u201cIt is different for men and women?\u201d she asked, disbelief creeping into her tone.\n\u201cOnly some,\u201d I reassured her. \u201cAnd only small things.\u201d\n\u201cThere is so much,\u201d she said, allowing a note of despair into her voice. \u201cWith one\u2019s family one knows what every small movement of face means. You grow up watching. You know the all of what is in them. Those friends you are young with, before you know better than to grin at everything. It is easy with them. But this . . .\u201d She shook her head. \u201cHow can one possibly remember when to correctly show one\u2019s teeth? How often am I supposed to touch eyes?\u201d\n\u201cI understand,\u201d I said. \u201cI am very good at speaking in my language. I can make the cleverest meanings. But here that is useless.\u201d I sighed. \u201cKeeping my face still is very hard. I feel I am always holding my breath.\u201d\n\u201cNot always,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not always still of the face. When you are with . . .\u201d She trailed off, then quickly gestured, apology.\n\u201cI have none I am close to,\u201d I said. Gentle regret. \u201cI had hoped I was growing close to Vashet, but I fear I ruined that today.\u201d\nPenthe nodded. \u201cI saw.\u201d She reached out and ran her thumb along the side of my face. It felt cool against the swelling. \u201cYou must have angered her very.\u201d\n\u201cI can tell that by the ringing of my ears,\u201d I said.\nPenthe shook her head. \u201cNo. Your marks.\u201d She gestured to her own face this time. \u201cWith another, it might be a mistake, but Vashet would not leave such if she did not wish everyone to see.\u201d", "The bottom dropped out of my stomach and my hand went unconsciously to my face. Of course. This wasn\u2019t mere punishment. It was a message to all of Ademre.\n\u201cFool that I am,\u201d I said softly. \u201cI did not realize this until now.\u201d\nWe ate quietly for several minutes, before I asked, \u201cWhy did you come to sit with me today?\u201d\n\u201cWhen I saw you today, I thought I had heard many people speak about you. But I knew nothing of you from personal knowing.\u201d A pause.\n\u201cAnd what do others say?\u201d I said with a small, wry smile.\nShe reached out to touch the corner of my mouth with her fingertips. \u201cThat,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is the bent smile?\u201d\nGentle mocking, I gestured in explanation. \u201cBut of myself, not you. I can guess what they say.\u201d\n\u201cNot all is bad,\u201d she said gently.\nPenthe looked up at me and met my eyes then. They were huge in her small face, slightly darker grey than usual. They were so bright and clear that when she smiled, the sight of it almost broke my heart. I felt tears well up in my eyes and I quickly looked down, embarrassed.\n\u201cOh!\u201d she said softly, and gestured a hurried distressed apology. \u201cNo. I am wrong with my smiling and eye touching. I meant this.\u201d Kind encouragement.\n\u201cYou are right with your smiling,\u201d I said without looking up, blinking furiously in an attempt to clear the tears away. \u201cIt is an unexpected kindness on a day when I do not deserve such a thing. You are the first to speak with me from your own desire. And there is a sweetness in your face that hurts my heart.\u201d I made gratitude with my left hand, glad that I didn\u2019t need to meet her eyes to show her how I felt.\nHer left hand crossed the table and caught hold of mine. Then she turned my hand face up and pressed comfort softly into my palm.\nI looked up and gave her what I hoped was a reassuring smile.\nShe mirrored it almost exactly, then covered her mouth again. \u201cI maintain anxiousness about my smiling.\u201d\n\u201cYou should not. You have the perfect mouth for smiling.\u201d\nPenthe looked up at me again, her eyes meeting mine for a heartbeat before darting away. \u201cTrue?\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cIn my own language, it is a mouth I would write a\u2014\u201d I brought myself up short, sweating a bit when I realized I\u2019d almost said \u201csong.\u201d", "\u201cPoem?\u201d she suggested helpfully.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cIt is a smile worthy of a poem.\u201d\n\u201cMake one then,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my language.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cIt would be a bear\u2019s poem. Too clumsy for you.\u201d This just seemed to spur her on, and her eyes grew eager. \u201cDo. If it is\nclumsy, it will make me feel better of my own stumbling.\u201d\n\u201cIf I do,\u201d I threatened, \u201cyou must, too. In my language.\u201d\nI\u2019d thought this would scare her away, but after only a moment\u2019s hesitation\nshe nodded.\nI thought of the only Ademic poetry I had heard: a few snippets from the\nold silk spinner and the piece from the story Shehyn had told about the archer. It wasn\u2019t much to go on.\nI thought of the words I knew, the sounds of them. I felt the absence of my lute sharply here. This is why we have music, after all. Words cannot always do the work we need them to. Music is there for when words fail us.\nFinally I looked around nervously, glad there were only a scattered handful of people left in the dining hall. I leaned toward her and said:\nDouble-weaponed Penthe\nNo sword in hand,\nHer flower-mouth curves,\nAnd cuts a heart a dozen steps away.\nShe gave the smile again, and it was just as I said. I felt the sharpness of it in my chest. Felurian had had a beautiful smile, but it was old and knowing. Penthe\u2019s smile was bright as a new penny. It was like cool water on my dry, tired heart.\nThe sweet smile of a young woman. There is nothing better in the world. It is worth more than salt. Something in us sickens and dies without it. I am sure of this. Such a simple thing. How strange. How wonderful and strange.\nPenthe closed her eyes for a moment, her mouth moving silently as she chose the words of her own poem.\nThen she opened her eyes and spoke in Aturan.\nBurning as a branch,\nKvothe speaks.\nBut the mouth that threatens boots", "reveals a dancing bear.\nI smiled wide enough to make my face hurt. \u201cIt is lovely,\u201d I said honestly. \u201cIt is the first poem anyone has ever made for me.\u201d\nAfter my conversation with Penthe, I felt considerably better. I was uncertain as to whether or not we had been flirting, but that hardly mattered. It was enough for me to know there was at least one person in Haert who didn\u2019t want me dead.\nI walked to Vashet\u2019s house as I usually did after meals. Half of me hoped she would greet me, smiling and sarcastic, the morning\u2019s unpleasantness put wordlessly behind us. The other half of me feared she would refuse to speak with me at all.\nAs I came over the rise, I saw her sitting on a wooden bench outside her door. She leaned against the rough stone wall of her house, as if she were merely enjoying the afternoon sun. I drew a deep breath and let it out, feeling myself relax.\nBut as I came closer, I saw her face. She was not smiling. Neither did she wear the impassive Adem mask. She watched me approach, her expression hangman grim.\nI spoke as soon as I came close enough. \u201cVashet,\u201d I said earnestly. \u201cI\u2019m \u2014\u201d\nStill sitting, Vashet held up her hand, and I stopped speaking as quickly as if she had struck me across the mouth. \u201cApology now is of little consequence,\u201d she said, her voice flat and chill as slate. \u201cAnything you say at this point cannot be trusted. You know I am well and truly angry, so you are in the grip of fear.\n\u201cThis means I cannot trust any word you say, as it comes from fear. You are clever, and charming, and a liar. I know you can bend the world with your words. So I will not listen.\u201d\nShe shifted her position on the bench, then continued. \u201cEarly on I noticed a gentleness in you. It is a rare thing in one so young, and it was a large piece of what convinced me you were worth teaching. But as the days pass, I glimpse something else. Some other face that is far from gentle. I have\n \ndismissed these as flickers of false light, thinking them the brags of a young man or the odd jokes of a barbarian.\n\u201cBut today as you spoke, it came to me that the gentleness was the mask. And this other half-seen face, this dark and ruthless thing, that is the true face hiding underneath.\u201d\nVashet gave me a long look. \u201cThere is something troubling inside you. Shehyn has seen it in your conversations. It is not a lack of the Lethani. But this makes my unease more, not less. That means there is something in you deeper than the Lethani. Something the Lethani cannot mend.\u201d\nShe met my eye. \u201cIf this is the case, then I have been wrong to teach you. If you have been clever enough to show me a false face for so long, then you are a danger to more than just the school. If this is the case, then Carceret is right, and you should be killed swiftly for the safety of everyone involved.\u201d\nVashet came to her feet, moving as if she were very tired. \u201cThis I have thought today. And I will continue to think for long hours tonight. Tomorrow I will have decided. Take this time to order your thoughts and make whatever preparations seem best to you.\u201d\nThen, without meeting my eye, she turned and went into her house, closing the door silently behind her.\nFor a while, I wandered aimlessly. I went to watch the sword tree, hoping I might find Celean there, but she was nowhere to be seen. Watching the tree itself did nothing to soothe me. Not today.\nSo I went to the baths, where I soaked myself joylessly. Afterward, in one of the mirrors scattered through the smaller rooms, I caught the first glimpse of my face since Vashet had struck me. Half my face was red and swollen, with bruises beginning to mottle blue and yellow around my temple and the line of my jaw. I also had the raw beginnings of a profoundly blackened eye.\nAs I stared at myself in the mirror I felt a low anger flicker to life deep in my belly. I was, I decided, tired of waiting helplessly while others decided whether I could come or go. I had played their game, learned their language, been unfailingly polite, and in return I had been treated like a dog. I had been beaten, sneered at, and threatened with death and worse. I was finished with it.\n \nSo I made my way slowly around Haert. I visited the twin sisters, the talkative smithy, and the tailor where I had bought my clothes. I chatted amiably, passing the time, asking questions, and pretending I didn\u2019t look as if someone had beaten me unconscious a handful of hours ago.\nMy preparations took a long time. I missed dinner, and the sky was growing dark by the time I came back to the school. I went straight to my room and closed the door behind me.\nThen I emptied the contents of my pockets onto my bed, some purchased, some stolen. Two fine, soft beeswax candles. A long shard of brittle steel from a poorly forged sword. A spool of blood-red thread. A small stoppered bottle of water from the baths.\nI closed my fist tightly around the last. Most people don\u2019t understand how much heat water holds inside it. That is why it takes so long to boil. Despite the fact that the scalding-hot pool I had pulled this from was more than half a mile away, what I held in my hand was of better use to a sympathist than a glowing coal. This water had fire in it.\nI thought of Penthe with a twinge of regret. Then I picked up a candle and began to turn it in my hands, warming it with my skin, softening the wax and beginning to shape a doll of it.\nI sat in my room, thinking dark thoughts as the last of the light faded from the sky. I looked over the tools I had gathered and knew deep in my gut that sometimes a situation grows so tangled that words are useless. What other option did I have, now that words had failed me?\nWhat do any of us have when words fail us?", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-ONE": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-ONE\nWhen Words Fail\nIT WAS WELL INTO the dark hours of night when I approached Vashet\u2019s house, but there was candlelight flickering in her window. I didn\u2019t doubt she would have me killed or crippled for the good of all Ademre, but Vashet was nothing if not careful. She would give it a long night\u2019s thought beforehand.\nEmpty-handed, I knocked softly on her door. After a moment, she opened it. She still wore her mercenary reds, but she had removed most of the silk ties that held it tight to her body. Her eyes were tired.\nHer mouth thinned when she saw me standing there, and I knew if I spoke she would refuse to listen. So I gestured entreaty and stepped backward, out of the candlelight and into the dark. I knew her well enough by this point to be sure of her curiosity. Her eyes narrowed suspiciously as I stepped away, but after a moment\u2019s hesitation she followed me. She did not bring her sword.\nIt was a clear night, and we had a piece of moon to light our way. I led us up into the hills, away from the school, away from the scattered houses and shops of Haert.\nWe walked more than a mile before we came to the place I had chosen. A small grove of trees where a tall jumble of stone would keep any noise from carrying back toward the sleeping town.\nThe moonlight slanted in through the trees, revealing dark shapes in a tiny clear space tucked among the stones. There were two small wooden benches here. I took gentle hold of Vashet\u2019s arm and guided her to sit.\nMoving slowly, I reached into the deep leeward shadow of a nearby tree and brought out my shaed. I draped it carefully over a low-hanging branch so it hung like a dark curtain between us.\nThen I sat on the other bench, bent, and worked the clasps on my lute case. As each of them snapped open, the lute within made a familiar harmonic thrum, as if eager to be free.\nI brought it out and gently began to play.\nI had tucked a piece of cloth inside the bowl of the lute to soften the sound,", "not wanting it to carry over the rocky hills. And I had woven some of the red thread between the strings. Partly to keep them from ringing too brightly, and partly out of a desperate hope that it might bring me luck.\nI began with \u201cIn the Village Smithy.\u201d I did not sing, worried Vashet would be offended if I went that far. But even without the words, it is a song that sounds like weeping. It is music that speaks of empty rooms and a chill bed and the loss of love.\nWithout pausing, I moved on to \u201cViolet Bide,\u201d then \u201cHome Westward Wind.\u201d The last had been a favorite of my mother\u2019s, and as I played it I thought of her and began to cry.\nThen I played the song that hides in the center of me.That wordless music that moves through the secret places in my heart. I played it carefully, strumming it slow and low into the dark stillness of the night. I would like to say it is a happy song, that it is sweet and bright, but it is not.\nAnd, eventually, I stopped. The tips of my fingers burned and ached. It had been a month since I had played for any length of time, and they had lost their calluses.\nLooking up, I saw Vashet had pulled my shaed aside and was watching me. The moon hung behind her, and I could not see the expression on her face.\n\u201cThis is why I do not have knives instead of hands, Vashet,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cThis is what I am.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-TWO": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-TWO\nLeaving\nTHE NEXT MORNING I woke early, ate quickly, and was back in my room before most of the school was stirring in their beds.\nI shouldered my lute and travelsack. I wrapped my shaed around me, checking that everything I needed was properly stowed in my pockets: red string, wax mommet, brittle iron, vial of water. Then I drew up the hood of my shaed and left the school, making my way to Vashet\u2019s house.\nVashet opened the door between my second and third knock. She was shirtless, and stood bare-breasted in the doorway. She eyed me pointedly, taking note of my cloak, my travelsack, my lute.\n\u201cIt is a morning for visitors,\u201d she said. \u201cCome in. The wind is chill this early.\u201d\nI stepped inside and tripped on the threshold, stumbling so that I had to rest my hand on Vashet\u2019s shoulder to steady myself. My hand caught clumsily in her hair as I did so.\nVashet shook her head as she closed the door behind me. Unconcerned with her near-nakedness, she reached both her hands behind her head and began to plait half of her hanging hair into a short, tight braid.\n\u201cThe sun was barely in the sky this morning when Penthe knocked on my door,\u201d she said conversationally. \u201cShe knew I was angry with you. And though she did not know what you had done, she spoke on your behalf.\u201d\nHolding the braid with one hand, Vashet reached for a piece of red string and tied it off. \u201cThen, almost before my door had time to close, Carceret paid me a visit. She congratulated me on finally giving you the treatment you deserve.\u201d\nShe reached back to braid the other side of her hair, her fingers twisting nimbly. \u201cBoth of them irritated me. They had no place speaking to me about my student.\u201d\nVashet tied off the second braid. \u201cThen I thought to myself, whose opinion do I respect more?\u201d She looked at me, making it a question for me to answer.", "\u201cYou respect your own opinion more,\u201d I said.\nVashet smiled widely. \u201cYou are exactly right. But Penthe is not entirely a fool either. And Carceret can be angry as a man when the mood is on her.\u201d\nShe picked up a long piece of dark silk and wound it around her torso, over her shoulders and across her naked breasts, supporting and holding them close to her chest. Then she tucked the end of the cloth into itself and it somehow remained tightly secured. I had seen her do this several times before, but how it actually worked was still a mystery to me.\n\u201cAnd what have you decided?\u201d I asked.\nShe shrugged her blood-red shirt over her head. \u201cYou are still a puzzle,\u201d she said. \u201cGentle and troubling and clever and foolish.\u201d Her head emerged from the shirt and she gave me a serious look. \u201cBut someone who breaks a puzzle because they cannot solve it has left the Lethani. I am not such a one.\u201d\n\u201cI am glad,\u201d I said. \u201cI would not have enjoyed leaving Haert.\u201d\nVashet raised an eyebrow at that. \u201cI daresay you would not.\u201d She gestured at the lute case that hung over my shoulder. \u201cLeave that here, or people will talk. Leave your bag too. You can take them back to your room later.\u201d\nShe looked at me speculatively. \u201cBut bring the cloak. I will show you how to fight while wearing it. Such things can be useful, but only if you can avoid tripping over them.\u201d\nI went back to my training almost as if nothing had happened. Vashet showed me how to avoid tripping over my own cloak. How it could be used to bind a weapon or disarm the unwary. She commented on it being very fine, strong, and durable, but never seemed to note anything unusual about it.\nDays passed. I continued to spar with Celean and eventually learned to protect my precious manhood from all forms of uncouth attack. Slowly, I grew skilled enough that we were nearly even in our bouts, trading victories back and forth.\nThere were even a handful of conversations with Penthe at mealtimes, and I was glad to have one other person willing to occasionally smile in my direction.\nBut I was no longer at my ease in Haert. I had come too close to disaster. Whenever I spoke to Vashet I thought twice about every word. Some words I\n \nthought about three times.\nAnd while Vashet seemed to return to her familiar wry and smiling self, I\nwould catch her watching me from time to time, her face grim, her eyes intent.\nAs the days passed, the tension between us gradually wore away, fading as slowly as the bruises on my face. I like to think eventually it would have disappeared entirely. But we were not given enough time for that.\nIt came like lightning from the clear blue sky.\nVashet opened her door to my knock. But instead of coming outside, she\nstood in the doorway. \u201cTomorrow is your test,\u201d she said.\nFor a second, I didn\u2019t understand what she was talking about. I had been\nfocusing so intently on my sword practice, my sparring with Celean, the language, the Lethani. I had almost forgotten the purpose of it all.\nI felt a rush of excitement in my chest, followed by a chill knot in my stomach. \u201cTomorrow?\u201d I said stupidly.\nShe nodded, smiling faintly at my expression.\nHer subdued response did little to set me at my ease. \u201cSo soon?\u201d \u201cShehyn feels it would be best. If we wait another month, there could be\nearly snow, keeping you from going freely on your way.\u201d\nI hesitated, then said, \u201cYou aren\u2019t telling me the whole truth, Vashet.\u201d Another faint smile and a small shrug. \u201cYou\u2019re right in that, though\nShehyn does think waiting is unwise. You are charming, in your clumsy barbarian way. The longer you are here, the more folk will come to feel kindly toward you....\u201d\nI felt the chill settle deeper into my gut. \u201cAnd if I am to be mutilated, it would be better if it were done before more folk realize I\u2019m actually a real person and not some faceless barbarian,\u201d I said harshly, though not as harshly as I wanted to.\nVashet looked down, then nodded. \u201cYou would not have heard. But Penthe blackened Carceret\u2019s eye two days ago in an argument about you. Celean too, has grown fond of you, and talks to the other children. They watch you from the trees while you train.\u201d She was still for a moment. \u201cAnd there are others.\u201d\nI knew enough after all this time to read Vashet\u2019s small silence for what it\n \nreally meant. Suddenly her muted mood, her stillness made much better sense.\n\u201cShehyn must attend to the best interests of the school,\u201d Vashet said. \u201cShe must decide according to what is right. She cannot allow herself to be swayed by the fact that some few are fond of you. At the same time, if she makes a correct decision and many in the school resent it, that is not good either.\u201d Another shrug. \u201cSo.\u201d\n\u201cAm I ready?\u201d\nVashet was quiet for a long time. \u201cThat\u2019s not an easy question,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing invited to the school isn\u2019t merely a matter of skill. It is a test of fit, of suitability. If one of us fails, we can try again. Tempi took his test four times before he was admitted. For you there will only be one chance.\u201d She looked up at me. \u201cAnd ready or not, it is time.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-THREE": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-THREE\nThe Spinning Leaf\nTHE NEXT MORNING VASHET came to collect me just as I was finishing my breakfast. \u201cCome,\u201d she said. \u201cCarceret has been praying for a storm all night, but it\u2019s only gusting.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t know what that meant, but I didn\u2019t feel like asking either. I returned my wooden plate and turned around to find Penthe standing there, a slight yellowing bruise along her jawline.\nPenthe didn\u2019t say anything, merely gripped my arms in an open show of support. Then she hugged me tightly. I was surprised when her head only came up to my chest. I\u2019d forgotten how small she was. The dining room was even more quiet than normal, and while no one was staring, everyone was watching.\nVashet walked me to the tiny park where we had first met and began our usual limbering stretch. The routine of it relaxed me, lulling my anxiety to a dull rumble. When we were finished,Vashet led me down into the hidden valley of the sword tree. I wasn\u2019t surprised. Where else would the test take place?\nThere were a dozen people scattered in the open field around the tree. Most of them were dressed in mercenary reds, but I saw three wearing lighter clothes. I guessed they were important members of the community, or perhaps retired mercenaries still involved with the school.\nVashet pointed toward the tree. At first I thought she was drawing my attention to the motion of it. It was, as she had said, a rather blustery day, and the branches lashed wildly at the empty air. Then I saw a glint of metal against its trunk. Looking more closely, I could see a sword there, tied to the trunk of the tree.\nI thought of Celean dancing among the sharp leaves to slap the trunk of the tree. Of course.\n\u201cThere are several items around the base of the tree,\u201dVashet said. \u201cYour test is to go in, choose one, and bring it out again.\u201d", "\u201cThis is the test?\u201d I demanded. It came out a little sharper than I\u2019d planned. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ask?\u201d she countered dryly, then laid her hand gently on my arm. \u201cI would have,\u201d she said. \u201cEventually. But I knew if I told you too soon, you would try your hand at it and hurt yourself.\u201d\n\u201cWell thank God we saved that for today,\u201d I said, then sighed. Resigned apology . \u201cWhat happens if I go in there and get cut to ribbons?\u201d\n\u201cGetting cut is usually a given,\u201d she said and pulled aside the neck of her shirt, revealing a pair of familiar pale, thin scars on her shoulder. \u201cThe question is how much, and where, and how you behave.\u201d She shrugged her shirt back into place. \u201cThe leaves will not cut deep, but be careful of your face and neck. The places where vessels and tendons are close to the surface. A cut on your chest or arm can be mended easily. Less so a severed ear.\u201d\nI watched the tree as it caught a gust of wind, branches flailing madly. \u201cWhat keeps a person from crawling there on hands and knees?\u201d\n\u201cPride,\u201d she said, her eyes searching my face. \u201cWill you be known as the one who crawled during his test?\u201d\nI nodded. This was an issue for me especially. As a barbarian, I had twice as much to prove.\nI looked at the tree again. It was thirty feet from the edge of the lashing branches to the trunk. I thought back to the scars I\u2019d seen on Tempi\u2019s body, on Carceret\u2019s face. \u201cSo this is a test of nerve,\u201d I said. \u201cA test of pride.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a test of many things,\u201d Vashet said. \u201cYour behavior signifies a great deal. You could throw your arms over your face and rush ahead. The straightest line is quickest, after all. But what does that reveal of you? Are you a bull that charges blindly? Are you an animal without subtlety or grace?\u201d She shook her head, frowning. \u201cI expect better from a student of mine.\u201d\nI squinted my eyes, trying to see what other items were gathered around the tree. \u201cI suppose I\u2019m not allowed to ask what the proper choice is.\u201d\n\u201cThere are many proper choices, and many more improper ones. It is different for everyone. The item you bring back reveals much. What you do with the item afterward reveals much. How you comport yourself reveals much.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cAll these things Shehyn will consider before deciding if you are to be admitted into the school.\u201d\n\u201cIf Shehyn is the one to decide, why are all these others here?\u201d\nVashet forced a smile, and I saw anxiety lurking deep in her eyes. \u201cShehyn", "does not embody the entire school herself.\u201d She gestured to the distant Adem standing around the sword tree. \u201cLess does she represent the entirety of the path of the Latantha.\u201d\nI looked around and realized the handful of non-red shirts were not light, but white. These were the heads of other schools. They had traveled here to see the barbarian take his test.\n\u201cIs this usual?\u201d I asked.\nVashet shook her head. \u201cI could feign ignorance. But I suspect Carceret spread word.\u201d\n\u201cCan they overrule Shehyn\u2019s decision?\u201d I asked.\nVashet shook her head. \u201cNo. It is her school, her decision. No one would dispute her right to make it.\u201d At her side, her hand flicked. However.\n\u201cVery well,\u201d I said.\nVashet reached out and gripped my hand in both of hers, squeezed it, then let it fall.\nI walked to the sword tree. For a moment the wind eased, and the thick canopy of hanging branches reminded me of the tree where I had met the Cthaeh. It was not a comforting thought.\nI watched the spinning leaves, trying not to think of how sharp they were. How they would slice into the meat of me. How they could glide through the thin skin of my hands and slice through the delicate tendons underneath.\nFrom the edge of the canopy to the safety of the trunk couldn\u2019t be more than thirty feet. In some ways, not very far at all....\nI thought of Celean darting wildly through the leaves. I thought of her, jumping and swatting branches away. If she could do it, then certainly so could I.\nBut even as I thought it, I knew it simply wasn\u2019t true. Celean had played here all her life. She was skinny as a twig, quick as a cricket, and half my size. Compared to her, I was a lumbering bear.\nI saw a handful of Adem mercenaries on the far side of the tree. Two of the more intimidating white shirts were there as well. I could feel their eyes on me, and in a strange way, I was glad.\nWhen you\u2019re alone, it\u2019s easy to be afraid. It\u2019s easy to focus on what might be lurking in the dark at the bottom of the cellar steps. It\u2019s easy to obsess on unproductive things, like the madness of stepping into a storm of spinning knives. When you\u2019re alone it\u2019s easy to sweat, panic, fall apart . . .\nBut I wasn\u2019t alone. And it wasn\u2019t just Vashet and Shehyn watching me.", "There were a dozen mercenaries and the heads of other schools besides. I had an audience. I was onstage. And there is nowhere in the world I am more comfortable than on a stage.\nI waited just outside the reach of the longest branches, watching for a break in their motion. I hoped their random spinning would, just for a moment, open into a path I could dart through, striking away any leaves that came too close. I could use Fan Water to keep them away from my face.\nI stood at the edge of the canopy and watched, waiting for an opening, trying to anticipate the pattern. The motion of the tree lulled me like it had so many times before. It was beautiful, all circles and arcs.\nAs I watched, gently dazed by the motion of the tree, I felt my mind slip lightly into the clear, empty float of Spinning Leaf. I realized the motion of the tree wasn\u2019t random at all, really. It was actually a pattern made of endless changing patterns.\nAnd then, my mind open and empty, I saw the wind spread out before me. It was like frost forming on a blank sheet of window glass. One moment, nothing. The next, I could see the name of the wind as clearly as the back of my own hand.\nI looked around for a moment, marveling in it. I tasted the shape of it on my tongue and knew if desired I could stir it to a storm. I could hush it to a whisper, leaving the sword tree hanging empty and still.\nBut that seemed wrong. Instead I simply opened my eyes wide to the wind, watching where it would choose to push the branches. Watching where it would flick the leaves.\nThen I stepped under the canopy, calmly as you would walk through your own front door. I took two steps, then stopped as a pair of leaves sliced through the air in front of me. I stepped sideways and forward as the wind spun another branch through the space behind me.\nI moved through the dancing branches of the sword tree. Not running, not frantically batting them away with my hands. I stepped carefully, deliberately. It was, I realized, the way Shehyn moved when she fought. Not quickly, though sometimes she was quick. She moved perfectly, always where she needed to be.\nAlmost before I realized it, I was standing on the dark earth that circled the wide trunk of the sword tree. The spinning leaves could not reach here. Safe for the moment, I relaxed and focused on what was waiting there for me.\nThe sword I had seen from the edge of the clearing was bound to the tree", "with a white silk cord that ran around the trunk. The sword was half-drawn from its sheath, and I could see the blade was similar to Vashet\u2019s sword. The metal was an odd, burnished grey without mark or blemish.\nNext to the tree on a small table sat a familiar red shirt, folded neatly in half. There was an arrow with stark white fletching and a polished wooden cylinder of the sort that would hold a scroll.\nA bright glitter caught my eye, and I turned to see a thick gold bar nestled in the dark earth among the roots of the tree. Was it truly gold? I bent and touched it. It was chill under my fingers, and was too heavy for my single hand to pry up from the ground. How much did it weigh? Forty pounds? Fifty? Enough gold for me to stay at the University forever, no matter how viciously they raised my tuition.\nI slowly made my way around the trunk of the sword tree and saw a fluttering piece of silk hanging from a low branch. There was another sword of a more ordinary sort, hanging from the same white cord. There were three blue flowers tied with a blue ribbon. There was a tarnished Vintish halfpenny. There was a long, flat whetstone, dark with oil.\nThen I came to the other side of the tree and saw my lute case leaning casually against the trunk.\nSeeing it there, knowing someone had gone into my room and taken it from under my bed, filled me with a sudden, terrible rage. It was all the worse knowing what the Adem thought of musicians. It meant they knew I wasn\u2019t merely a barbarian, but a cheap and tawdry whore as well. It had been left there to taunt me.\nI had called the name of the wind in the grip of a terrible anger before, in Imre after Ambrose had broken my lute. And I had called it in terror and fury to defend myself against Felurian. But this time the knowledge of it hadn\u2019t come to me borne on the back of some strong emotion. I had slipped into it gently, the way you must reach out to catch a gently floating thistle seed.\nSo when I saw my lute, the welter of hot emotion brought me crashing out of Spinning Leaf like a sparrow struck with a stone. The name of the wind tattered to shreds, leaving me empty and blind. Looking around at the madly dancing leaves, I could see no pattern at all, only a thousand windblown razors slicing at the air.\nI finished my slow circuit of the tree with a knot of worry tightening my stomach. The presence of my lute made one thing clear. Any of these objects could be a trap someone had left for me.", "Vashet had said the test was more than what I brought back from the tree. It was also how I brought it, and what I did with it afterward. If I brought out the heavy bar of gold and gave it to Shehyn, would that show I was willing to bring money back to the school? Or it would signify that I would cling greedily to something heavy and unwieldy despite the fact that it put me in danger?\nThe same was true of any of these things. If I took the red shirt, I could be seen as either nobly striving for the right to wear it, or arrogantly presuming I was good enough to join their ranks. This was doubly true of the ancient sword that hung there. I didn\u2019t doubt that it was as precious to the Adem as a child.\nI made another slow circuit of the tree, pretending to consider my choices, but really just stalling for time. I nervously looked over the items a second time. There was a small book with a brass lock. There was a spindle of grey woolen thread. There was a smooth round stone sitting on a clean white cloth.\nAs I looked at them all, I realized any choice I made could be interpreted so many ways. I didn\u2019t know nearly enough about Adem culture to guess what my item might signify.\nEven if I did, without the name of the wind to guide me back through the canopy, I would be cut to ribbons leaving the tree. Probably not enough to maim me, but enough to make it clear I was a clumsy barbarian who obviously didn\u2019t belong.\nI looked at the gold bar again. If I chose that, at least the weight of it would give me an excuse for being awkward on my way out. Perhaps I could still make a good showing of it . . .\nNervously I made a third circuit of the tree. I felt the wind pick up, gusting and making the branches flail about more wildly than before. It pulled the sweat from my body, chilling me and making me shiver.\nIn the middle of that anxious moment, I was suddenly aware of nothing as much as the sudden, urgent pressure of my bladder. My biology cared nothing for the gravity of my situation, and I was seized with a powerful need to relieve myself.\nThus it was that in the center of a storm of knives, in the midst of my test that was also my trial, that I thought of urinating up against the side of the sacred sword tree while two dozen proud and deadly mercenaries watched me do it.\nIt was such a horrifying and inappropriate thought that I burst out laughing.", "And when the laugh rolled out of me, the tension knotting my stomach and clawing at the muscles of my back melted away. Whatever choice I made, it would have to be better than pissing on the Latantha.\nAt that moment, no longer boiling with anger, no longer gripped with fear, I looked at the moving leaves around me. Always before when the name of the wind had left me, it had faded like a dream on waking: irretrievable as an echo or a fading sigh.\nBut this time it was different, I had spent hours watching the patterns of these moving leaves. I looked out through the branches of the tree and thought of Celean jumping and spinning, laughing and running.\nAnd there it was. Like the name of an old friend that had simply slipped my mind for a moment. I looked out among the branches and I saw the wind. I spoke the long name of it gently, and the wind grew gentle. I breathed it out as a whisper, and for the first time since I had come to Haert the wind went quiet and utterly still.\nIn this place of endless wind, it seemed as if the world were suddenly holding its breath. The unceasing dance of the sword tree slowed, then stopped. As if it were resting. As if it had decided to let me go.\nI stepped away from the tree and began to walk slowly toward Shehyn, bringing nothing with me. As I walked, I raised my left hand and drew my open palm across the razor edge of a hanging leaf.\nI came to stand before Shehyn, stopping the polite distance from her. I stood, my face an impassive mask. I stood, utterly silent, perfectly still.\nI extended my left hand, bloody palm up, and closed it into a fist. The gesture meant willing.There was more blood than I\u2019d expected, and it pressed between my fingers to run down the back of my hand.\nAfter a long moment, Shehyn nodded. I relaxed, and only then did the wind return.", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FOUR": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FOUR\nOf Names\n\u201cYOU,\u201d VASHET SAID AS we walked through the hills, \u201care one great gaudy showboating bastard, you know that?\u201d\nI inclined my head slightly to her, gracefully gesturing subordinate acceptance.\nShe cuffed me on the side of the head. \u201cGet over yourself, you melodramatic ass.You can fool them, but not me.\u201d\nVashet held her hand to her chest as if gossiping. \u201cDid you hear what Kvothe brought back from the sword tree? The things a barbarian cannot understand: silence and stillness. The heart of Ademre. What did he offer to Shehyn? Willingness to bleed for the school.\u201d\nShe looked at me, her expression trapped between disgust and amusement. \u201cSeriously, it\u2019s like you stepped out of a storybook.\u201d\nI gestured: Gracious flattering understated affectionate acceptance. Vashet reached out and flicked my ear hard with a finger.\n\u201cOw!\u201d I burst out laughing. \u201cFine. But don\u2019t you dare accuse me of\nmelodrama. You people are one great unending dramatic gesture. The quiet. The blood-red clothes. The hidden language. Secrets and mysteries. It\u2019s like your lives are one giant dumbshow.\u201d I met her eye. \u201cAnd I do mean that in all its various clever implications.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you impressed Shehyn,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich is the most important thing. And you did it in such a way that the heads of the other schools won\u2019t be able to grumble too much. Which is the other most important thing.\u201d\nWe reached our destination, a low building of three rooms next to a small split-timber goat pen. \u201cHere is the one who will tend to your hand,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhat of the apothecary?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cThe apothecary is close friends with Carceret\u2019s mother,\u201d Vashet said. \u201cAnd I would not have her looking after your hands for a weight of gold.\u201d She nodded her head at the nearby house. \u201cDaeln, on the other hand, is who I would come to if I needed mending.\u201d", "She knocked on the door. \u201cYou may be a member of the school, but do not forget that I am still your teacher. In all things, I know what is best.\u201d\nLater, my hand tightly bandaged, Vashet and I sat with Shehyn. We were in a room I\u2019d never seen before, smaller than the rooms where we had discussed the Lethani. There was a small, messy writing desk, some flowers in a vase, and several comfortably cushioned chairs. Along one wall was a picture of three birds in flight against a sunset sky, not painted, but composed of thousands of pieces of bright enameled tile. I suspected we might be in the equivalent of Shehyn\u2019s study.\n\u201cHow is your hand?\u201d Shehyn said.\n\u201cFine,\u201d I said.\u201cIt is a shallow cut. Daeln has the smallest stitches I have ever seen. He is quite remarkable.\u201d\nShe nodded. Approval.\nI held up my left hand, wrapped in clean white linen. \u201cThe hard part will be keeping this hand idle for four days. I already feel as if it were my tongue that were cut, and not my hand.\u201d\nShehyn gave a slight smile at this, startling me. The familiarity of the expression was a great compliment. \u201cYou performed quite well today. Everyone is speaking of it.\u201d\n\u201cI expect the few that saw have better things to speak about,\u201d I said modestly.\nAmused disbelief. \u201cThat may be true, but those who watched from hiding will doubtless say what they have seen. Celean herself will have already told a hundred people unless I miss my guess. By tomorrow everyone will expect your stride to shake the ground as if you were Aethe himself come back to visit us.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t think of anything to say, so I kept quiet. A rarity for me. But as I\u2019ve said, I had been learning.\n\u201cThere is something I have been waiting to speak to you about,\u201d Shehyn said. Guarded curiosity. \u201cAfter Tempi brought you here, he told me the long story of your time together,\u201d she said. \u201cOf your search for the bandits.\u201d\nI nodded.\n\u201cIs it true that you made blood magic to destroy some men, then called\n \nlightning to destroy the rest?\u201d\nVashet looked up at this, glancing back and forth between us. I had grown\nso used to speaking Aturan with her that it was odd to see the expressionless Adem impassivity covering her face. Still, I could tell she was surprised. She hadn\u2019t known.\nI thought of trying to offer an explanation for my actions, then decided against it. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cYou are powerful then.\u201d\nI had never thought of it in those terms before. \u201cI have some power. Others are more powerful.\u201d\n\u201cIs that why you seek the Ketan? To gain power?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I seek from curiosity. I seek the knowing of things.\u201d\n\u201cKnowing is a type of power,\u201d Shehyn pointed out, then seemed to change\nthe subject. \u201cTempi told me there was a Rhinta among the bandits as their leader.\u201d\n\u201cRhinta?\u201d I asked respectfully.\n\u201cA bad thing. A man who is more than a man, yet less than a man.\u201d \u201cA demon?\u201d I asked, using the Aturan word without thinking.\n\u201cNot a demon,\u201d Shehyn said, switching easily to Aturan. \u201cThere are no\nsuch things as demons. Your priests tell stories of demons to frighten you.\u201d She met my eye briefly, gesturing a graceful: Apologetic honesty and serious import . \u201cBut there are bad things in the world. Old things in the shape of men. And there are a handful worse than all the rest. They walk the world freely and do terrible things.\u201d\nI felt hope rising within me. \u201cI have also heard them called the Chandrian,\u201d I said.\nShehyn nodded. \u201cI have heard this too. But Rhinta is a better word.\u201d Shehyn gave me a long look and fell back into Ademic. \u201cGiven what Tempi has told me of your reaction, I think that you have met such a one before.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWill you meet such a one again?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201dThe certainty in my own voice surprised me. \u201cWith purpose?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWhat purpose?\u201d\n\u201cTo kill him.\u201d\n\u201cSuch things are not easily killed.\u201d", "I nodded.\n\u201cWill you use what Tempi has taught you to do this?\u201d\n\u201cI will use all things to that purpose.\u201d I unconsciously began to gesture\nabsolute, but the bandage on my hand stopped me. I frowned at it.\n\u201cThat is good,\u201d Shehyn said. \u201cYour Ketan will not be enough. It is poor for\none as old as you are. Good for a barbarian. Good for one with as little training as you have had, but still poor overall.\u201d\nI fought hard to keep the eagerness out of my voice, wishing I could use my hand to indicate how important the question was to me. \u201cShehyn, I have a great desire to know more of these Rhinta.\u201d\nShehyn was quiet for a long moment. \u201cI will consider this,\u201d she said at last, making a gesture I thought might be trepidation. \u201cSuch things are not spoken of lightly.\u201d\nI kept my face impassive, and forced my bandaged hand to say profound respectful desire. \u201cI thank you for considering it, Shehyn. Anything you could tell me of them I would value more than a weight of gold.\u201d\nVashet gestured firm discomfort, then polite desire, difference. Two span ago I couldn\u2019t have understood, but now I realized she wanted to move the conversation onto a different subject.\nSo I bit my tongue and let it go. I knew enough about the Adem by this point to realize that pushing the issue was the worst thing to do if I wanted to learn more. In the Commonwealth I could have pressed the point, teased and wheedled it out of the person I was talking to. That wouldn\u2019t work here. Stillness and silence were the only things that would work. I had to be patient and let Shehyn return to the subject in her own time.\n\u201cI was saying,\u201d Shehyn continued. Reluctant confession.\u201cYour Ketan is poor. But were you to train yourself in proper fashion for a year, you would be Tempi\u2019s equal.\u201d\n\u201cYou flatter me.\u201d\n\u201cI do not. I tell you your weaknesses.You learn quickly. That leads to rash behavior, and rashness is not of the Lethani. Vashet is not alone in thinking there is something troubling about your spirit.\u201d\nShehyn gave me a long look. For over a minute she stared at me. Then she gave an eloquent shrug and glanced at Vashet, favoring the younger woman with a ghost of a smile. \u201cStill,\u201d Whimsical musing. \u201cif I have ever met someone without a single shadow on their heart, it was surely a child too young for speaking.\u201d She pushed herself out of her chair and brushed off her", "shirt with both hands. \u201cCome. Let us go and have a name for you.\u201d\nShehyn led the three of us up the side of a steep, rocky hill.\nNone of us had spoken since we had left the school. I didn\u2019t know what\nwas about to happen, but it didn\u2019t seem proper to ask. It would have seemed irreverent, like a groom blurting out, \u201cWhat comes next?\u201d halfway through his own wedding.\nWe came to a grassy ledge with a leaning tree clutching tight to the bare face of a cliff. Beside the tree was a thick wooden door, one of the hidden Adem homes.\nShehyn knocked and opened the door herself. Inside it wasn\u2019t cavelike at all. The stone walls were finished, and the floor was smooth wood. It was much larger than I\u2019d expected, too, with a high ceiling and six doors leading deeper into the stone of the cliff.\nA woman sat at a low table, copying something from one book into another. Her hair was white, her face wrinkled as an old apple. It occurred to me then that this was the first person I\u2019d seen reading or writing in all my time in Haert.\nThe old woman nodded a greeting at Shehyn, then turned to Vashet and her eyes crinkled around the edges. Gladness. \u201cVashet,\u201d she said. \u201cI did not know you were returned.\u201d\n\u201cWe are come for a name, Magwyn,\u201d Shehyn said. Polite formal entreaty.\n\u201cA name?\u201d Magwyn asked, puzzled. She looked from Shehyn to Vashet, then her eyes moved to where I stood behind them. To my bright red hair and my bandaged hand. \u201cAh,\u201d she said, growing suddenly somber.\nMagwyn closed her books and came to her feet. Her back was bent, and she took small, shuffling steps. She motioned me forward and walked a slow circle around me, looking me carefully up and down. She avoided looking at my face, but took hold of my unbandaged hand, turning it over to look at the palm and the fingertips.\n\u201cI would hear you say something,\u201d she said, still looking intently at my hand.\n\u201cAs you will, honored shaper of names,\u201d I said. Magwyn looked up at Shehyn. \u201cDoes he mock me?\u201d\n \n\u201cI think not.\u201d\nMagwyn made another circle of me, running her hands over my shoulders, my arms, the back of my neck. She moved her fingers through my hair, then stopped in front of me and looked me fully in the eye.\nHer eyes were like Elodin\u2019s. Not in any of the details. Elodin\u2019s eyes were green, sharp, and mocking. Magwyn\u2019s were the familiar Adem grey, slightly watery and red around the edges. No, the similarity was in how she looked at me. Elodin was the only other person I had met who could look at you like that, as if you were a book he was idly thumbing through.\nWhen Magwyn met my eyes for the first time, I felt like all the air had been sucked out of me. For the barest of moments I thought she might be startled by what she saw, but that was probably just my anxiety. I had come to the edge of disaster too often lately, and despite how well my recent test had gone, part of me was still waiting for the other shoe to drop.\n\u201cMaedre,\u201d she said, her eyes still fixed on mine. She looked down and made her way back to her book.\n\u201cMaedre?\u201dVashet said, a hint of dismay in her voice. She might have said more, but Shehyn reached out and cuffed her sharply on the side of the head. It was exactly the same motion Vashet had used to chastise me a thousand\ntimes in the last month. I couldn\u2019t help myself. I laughed.\nVashet and Shehyn glared at me. Actually glared.\nMagwyn turned to look at me. She didn\u2019t seem upset. \u201cDo you laugh at the\nname I have given you?\u201d\n\u201cNever, Magwyn,\u201d I said trying my best to gesture respect with my\nbandaged hand. \u201cNames are important things.\u201d\nShe continued to eye me. \u201cAnd what would a barbarian know of names?\u201d \u201cSome,\u201d I said, fumbling with my bandaged hand again. I couldn\u2019t add fine\nshades of meaning to my words without it. \u201cFar away, I have made a study of such things. I know more than many, but still only just a little.\u201d\nMagwyn looked at me for a long time. \u201cThen you will know you should not speak of your new name to anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a private thing, and dangerous to share.\u201d\nI nodded.\nMagwyn looked satisfied at this, and settled back onto her chair, opening a book. \u201cVashet, my little rabbit, you should come and visit me soon.\u201d Gentle chiding fondness.\n\u201cI will, grandmother,\u201d Vashet said.", "\u201cThank you, Magwyn,\u201d Shehyn said. Deferential gratitude.\nThe old woman nodded a distracted dismissal, and Shehyn led us from the cave.\nLater that evening, I walked back to Vashet\u2019s house. She was sitting on the bench out front, watching the sky as the sun began to set.\nShe tapped the bench beside her, and I took a seat. \u201cHow does it feel to no longer be a barbarian?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cMostly the same,\u201d I said. \u201cSlightly drunker.\u201d\nAfter dinner Penthe had pulled me away to her house, where there was a party of sorts. Call it a gathering, rather, as there was no music or dancing. Still, I was flattered that Penthe had gone to the effort of finding five other Adem who were willing to celebrate my admittance to the school.\nI was pleased to learn the Adem impassivity dissolved quite easily after a few drinks, and we were all grinning like barbarians in no time. It relaxed me, especially as much of my own clumsiness with the language could now be blamed on my bandaged hand.\n\u201cEarlier today,\u201d I said carefully, \u201cShehyn said she knew a story about the Rhinta.\u201d\nVashet turned to look at me, her face expressionless. Hesitant.\n\u201cI have searched all over the world for such a thing,\u201d I said.\u201cThere are few things I would value more.\u201d Utter sincerity.\u201cAnd I worry that I did a poor job of letting Shehyn know this.\u201d Questioning. Intense entreaty.\nVashet looked at me for a moment, as if waiting for me to continue. Then she gestured reluctance. \u201cI will mention it to her,\u201d she said. Reassurance. Finished.\nI nodded and let the subject drop.\nVashet and I sat for a while in companionable silence as the sun slowly sank into the horizon. She drew a deep breath and sighed expansively. I realized that, with the exception of waiting for me to catch my breath or recover from a fall, we had never done anything like this before. Up until this point, every moment we had spent together had been focused on my training.\n\u201cTonight,\u201d I said at last. \u201cPenthe told me she thought I had a fine anger, and that she\u2019d like to share it with me.\u201d\n \nVashet chuckled. \u201cThat didn\u2019t take very long.\u201d She gave me a knowing look. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\nI blushed a bit. \u201cAh. She . . . reminded me the Adem do not consider physical contact particularly intimate.\u201d\nVashet\u2019s smile grew practically lecherous. \u201cGrabbed hold of you, did she?\u201d\n\u201cAlmost,\u201d I said. \u201cI move more quickly than I did a month ago.\u201d\n\u201cI doubt you move quickly enough to keep away from Penthe,\u201d Vashet said. \u201cAll she is looking for is sexplay.There is no harm in it.\u201d\n\u201cThat is why I was asking you,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cTo see if there was any harm in it.\u201d\nVashet she raised an eyebrow, at the same time gesturing vague puzzlement.\n\u201cPenthe is quite lovely,\u201d I said carefully. \u201cHowever, you and I have . . .\u201d I looked for an appropriate term. \u201cBeen intimate.\u201d\nRealization washed over Vashet\u2019s face and she laughed again. \u201cWhat you mean is that we have been sexual. The intimacy between a teacher and student is greater by far than that.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d I said, relaxing.\u201cI\u2019d suspected something of the sort. But it is nice to know for certain.\u201d\nVashet shook her head. \u201cI had forgotten what it is like with you barbarians,\u201d she said, her voice heavy with fond indulgence. \u201cIt has been so many years since I had to explain such things to my poet king.\u201d\n\u201cSo you would not be offended if I were to . . .\u201d I made an inarticulate gesture with my bandaged hand.\n\u201cYou are young and energetic,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a healthy thing for you to do. Why would I be offended? Do I suddenly own your sex, that I should be worried about you giving it away?\u201d\nVashet stopped as if something had just occurred to her. She turned to look at me. \u201cAre you offended that I have been having sex with others all this while?\u201d She watched my face intently. \u201cI see you are startled by it.\u201d\n\u201cI am startled,\u201d I admitted. Then I did a mental inventory and was surprised to discover I wasn\u2019t sure how I felt. \u201cI feel I ought to be offended,\u201d I said at last. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I am.\u201d\nVashet nodded approvingly. \u201cThat is a good sign. It shows you are becoming civilized. The other feeling is what you were brought up to think. It is like an old shirt that no longer fits you. And now, when you look at it", "closely, you can see it was ugly to begin with.\u201d\nI hesitated for a moment.\u201cOut of curiosity,\u201d I said, \u201chow many others have\nyou been with since we have been together?\u201d\nVashet seemed surprised by the question. She pursed her mouth and\nlooked up at the sky for a long moment before shrugging. \u201cHow many people have I spoken with since then? How many have I sparred with? How many times have I eaten, or practiced my Ketan? Who counts such things?\u201d\n\u201cAnd most Adem think this way?\u201d I asked, glad to finally have the chance to ask these questions. \u201cThat sex is not an intimate thing?\u201d\n\u201cOf course it is intimate,\u201d Vashet said. \u201cAnything that brings two people close together is intimate. A conversation, a kiss, a whisper. Even fighting is intimate. But we are not strange about our sex. We do not feel shame about it. We do not feel it important to keep someone else\u2019s sex all to ourselves, like a miser hoarding gold.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cMore than any other, this strangeness in your thinking sets you barbarians apart.\u201d\n\u201cBut what of romance then?\u201d I asked, slightly indignant. \u201cWhat of love?\u201d\nVashet laughed again then, loud and long and vastly amused. Half of Haert must have heard it, and it echoed back to us from the distant hills.\n\u201cYou barbarians,\u201d she said, wiping moisture from her eyes. \u201cI had forgotten how backward you are. My poet king was the same way. It took him a long, miserable time before he realized the truth of things: There is a great deal of difference between a penis and a heart.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE\nCaesura\nTHE NEXT DAY I woke somewhat blearily. I hadn\u2019t drunk that much, but my body was no longer used to such things, and so I felt each drink three times that morning. I straggled to the baths, dunked myself in the hottest pool I could stand, then scrubbed the vaguely gritty feeling away as best I could.\nI was heading back to the dining hall when Vashet and Shehyn found me in the hallway.Vashet gestured for me to follow, and I fell in step behind them. I hardly felt up for training or a formal conversation, but refusing didn\u2019t seem like a realistic option.\nWe wound our way through several hallways, eventually emerging near the center of the school. Passing through a courtyard we approached a small, square building that Shehyn unlocked with a small iron key: the first locked door I had seen in all of Haert.\nThe three of us moved into a small windowless entryway. Vashet closed the outside door and the room grew black as pitch, cutting off the sound of the persistent wind. Then Shehyn opened the inner door. Warm light from a half-dozen candles greeted us. At first it seemed odd they had been left to burn in an empty room....\nThen I saw what hung on the walls. Swords gleamed in the candlelight, dozens of them covering the walls. They were all of them naked, their scabbards hanging underneath them.\nThere were no ritual trappings of the sort you might find in a Tehlin church. No tapestries or paintings. Just the swords themselves. Still, it was obvious that this was an important place. There was a tension in the air of the sort you might feel in the Archives or an old graveyard.\nShehyn turned to Vashet. \u201cChoose.\u201d\nVashet looked startled by this, almost stricken. She started to make a gesture, but Shehyn held up a hand before she could protest.\n\u201cHe is your student,\u201d Shehyn said. Refusal.\u201cYou have brought him into the school. It is your choice.\u201d", "Vashet looked from Shehyn, to me, to the dozens of gleaming swords. They were all slender and deadly, each subtly different from the others. Some were curved, some longer or thicker than others. Some showed signs of much use, while some few resembled Vashet\u2019s, with worn hilts and unmarked blades of grey burnished metal.\nSlowly,Vashet moved to the right-hand wall. She picked up a sword, hefted it, and put it back. Then she lifted a different one, gripped it, and held it out to me.\nI took hold of it. It was light and thin as a whisper.\n\u201cMaiden Combs Her Hair,\u201d Vashet said.\nI obeyed, feeling somewhat self-conscious, as Shehyn was watching. But\nbefore I made it halfway through the sweeping movement, Vashet was already shaking her head. She took the sword back from me and returned it to the wall.\nAfter another minute she handed me a second sword. It had worn etching running down the blade, like a crawling ivy. At Vashet\u2019s request, I made Heron Falling. I swept high and lunged low, sword flickering. Vashet raised an eyebrow to me, questioning.\nI shook my head. \u201cThe point is too heavy for me.\u201d\nVashet didn\u2019t seem particularly surprised and returned that sword to the wall as well.\nSo things continued. Vashet hefted swords and rejected most without a word. She set three more in my hands, asked for various pieces of the Ketan, then returned them to the wall without asking my opinion.\nVashet moved more slowly as she made her way along the second wall. She handed me a sword slightly curved like Penthe\u2019s, and my breath caught when I saw the blade was the same flawless, burnished grey as Vashet\u2019s. I took it carefully, but the grip wasn\u2019t right for my fingers. When I handed it back, I saw relief written plainly on her face.\nAs she progressed along the wall, occasionally Vashet would steal a glance at Shehyn. At those moments, she looked very little like my confident, swaggering teacher and very much like a young woman desperately hoping for a word of advice. Shehyn remained impassive.\nEventually Vashet came to the third wall, moving slower and slower. She handled almost every sword now, taking a long time before setting them back in their places.\nThen, slowly, she laid her hand on another sword with a blade of burnished", "grey. She lifted it off the wall, gripped it, and seemed to age ten years.\nVashet avoided looking at Shehyn, and handed me the sword. The guard of this one extended out slightly, curving to give a hint of protection to the hand.\nIt was nothing like a full hand guard. Anything that bulky would render half the Ketan useless. But it looked as if it would give my fingers an extra bit of shelter, and that was appealing to me.\nThe warm grip settled into my palm as smoothly as the neck of my lute.\nBefore she could ask, I made Maiden Combs Her Hair. It felt like stretching after a long stiff sleep. I eased into Twelve Stones, and for the smallest of moments I felt graceful as Penthe looked when she fought. I made Heron Falling and it was sweet and simple as a kiss.\nVashet held out her hand to take it back from me. I didn\u2019t want to give it up, but I did. I knew this was the worst possible time and place for me to make a scene.\nHolding the sword, Vashet turned to Shehyn. \u201cThis is the one for him,\u201d she said. And for the first time since I\u2019d known my teacher, it was as if all the laughing had been pressed out of her. Her voice was thin and dry.\nShehyn nodded. \u201cI agree.You have done well to find it.\u201d\nVashet\u2019s relief was palpable, though her face still looked somewhat stricken. \u201cIt will perhaps offset his name,\u201d she said. She held the sword out to Shehyn.\nShehyn gestured: Refusal. \u201cNo. Your student. Your choice. Your responsibility.\u201d\nVashet took the scabbard from the wall and sheathed the sword. Then she turned and held it out to me. \u201cThis is named Saicere.\u201d\n\u201cCaesura?\u201d I asked, startled by the name. Wasn\u2019t that what Sim had called the break in the line of Eld Vintic verse? Was I being given a poet\u2019s sword?\n\u201cSaicere,\u201d she said softly, as if it were the name of God. She stepped back, and I felt the weight of it settle back into my hands.\nSensing something was expected of me, I drew it from its sheath. The faint ring of leather and metal seemed a whisper of its name: Saicere. It felt light in my hand. The blade was flawless. I slid it back into its sheath and the sound was different. It sounded like the breaking of a line. It said: Caesura.\nShehyn opened the inner door, and we left as we came. Silently and with respect.\n \nThe rest of the day was quite the opposite of exciting. With a dogged and humorless persistence, Vashet taught me how to care for my sword. How to clean and oil my sword. How to dismantle and reassemble my sword. How to strap the scabbard to my shoulder or hip. How the slightly enlarged guard would alter a few of the grips and motions of the Ketan.\nThe sword was not mine. The sword belonged to the school. To Ademre. I would return it when I was no longer able to fight.\nWhile I normally have little tolerance for hearing the same thing over and over again, I let Vashet ramble. The least I could do was let her repeat herself a bit when she was plainly anxious and trying to settle her mind.\nAround the fifteenth repetition, I asked what I should do if the sword broke. Not the hilt or the guard, but the blade itself. Should I still bring it back?\nVashet gave me a look of dismay so raw it verged on horror. She didn\u2019t answer, and I made a point of not asking any more questions for the rest of the morning.\nAfter lunch Vashet took me back to Magwyn\u2019s cave. My teacher\u2019s mood seemed somewhat improved, but she was still far from her regular gregarious self.\n\u201cMagwyn will be giving you Saicere\u2019s story,\u201d she said. \u201cYou must memorize it.\u201d\n\u201cIts story?\u201d I asked.\nVashet shrugged. \u201cIn Ademic it is Atas. It is the history of your sword. Everyone who has carried it. What they have done. It is something you must know.\u201d\nWe reached the top of the path and stood before Magwyn\u2019s door. Vashet gave me a serious look. \u201cYou must be on your best behavior and be very polite.\u201d\n\u201cI will,\u201d I said.\n\u201cMagwyn is an important person, and you must attend closely to what she says.\u201d\n \n\u201cI will,\u201d I said.\nVashet knocked on the door and escorted me in.\nMagwyn sat at the same table as before. For all I could tell, she was\ncopying the same book. She smiled when she saw Vashet, then noticed me and let her face slide into the familiar Adem impassivity.\n\u201cMagwyn,\u201d Vashet said. Profoundly polite entreaty. \u201cThis one needs the Atas of his sword.\u201d\n\u201cWhich sword did you find for him?\u201d Magwyn asked, her face wrinkling even further as she squinted to see.\n\u201cSaicere,\u201dVashet said.\nMagwyn gave a laugh that was almost a cackle. She got down off her chair. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised,\u201d she said, and disappeared through a door that led back into the cliff.\nVashet let herself out, and I stood there feeling awkward, like one of those terrible dreams when you\u2019re on stage and can\u2019t remember what to say, or even what part you were meaning to play.\nMagwyn returned, carrying a thick book bound in brown leather. At a gesture from her, we took seats in chairs facing each other. Hers was a deeply cushioned leather chair. Mine was not. I sat with Caesura across my knees. Partly because it seemed appropriate, and partly because I was fond of the feel of it beneath my hand.\nShe opened the book, the binding crackling as she spread it open on her lap. She flipped pages for a moment until she found the place she was looking for. \u201cFirst came Chael,\u201d she read. \u201cWho shaped me in fire for an unknown purpose. He carried me then cast me aside.\u201d\nMagwyn looked up, unable to gesture as her hands were both occupied by the large book. \u201cWell?\u201d she demanded.\n\u201cWhat would you like me to do?\u201d I asked politely. I couldn\u2019t gesture due to my bandages. We made a fine pair of half-mutes.\n\u201cRepeat it back,\u201d she said, irritated. \u201cYou need to learn them all.\u201d\n\u201cFirst came Chael,\u201d I said. \u201cWho shaped me in fire for an unknown purpose. He carried me then cast me aside.\u201d\nShe nodded and continued. \u201cNext came Etaine . . .\u201d\nI repeated it. We continued this way for perhaps a half hour. Owner after owner. Name after name. Loyalties declaimed and enemies killed.\nAt first the names and places were tantalizing. Then, as it continued, the list began to depress me, as nearly each piece ended with the death of the", "owner. They were not peaceful deaths either. Some died in wars, some in duels. Many were merely \u201ckilled by\u201d or \u201cslain by,\u201d giving no clue as to the circumstances. After thirty of these, I had heard nothing resembling, \u201cPassed from this world peacefully in his sleep, surrounded by fat grandchildren.\u201d\nThen the list stopped being depressing and became simply boring instead.\n\u201cNext came Finol of the clear and shining eye,\u201d I repeated attentively. \u201cMuch beloved of Dulcen. She herself slew two daruna, then was killed by gremmen at the Drossen Tor.\u201d\nI cleared my throat before Magwyn could recite another passage. \u201cIf I may ask,\u201d I said. \u201cHow many have carried Caesura over the years?\u201d\n\u201cSaicere,\u201d she corrected me sharply. \u201cDo not presume to meddle with her name. It means to break, to catch, and to fly.\u201d\nI looked down at the sheathed sword across my lap. I felt the weight of it, the chill of the metal under my fingers. A small sliver of the smooth grey blade was visible above the top of the sheath.\nHow can I say this so you can understand? Saicere was a fine name. It was thin and bright and dangerous. It fit the sword like a glove fits a hand.\nBut it wasn\u2019t the perfect name. This sword\u2019s name was Caesura. This sword was the jarring break in a line of perfect verse. It was the broken breath. It was smooth and swift and sharp and deadly. The name didn\u2019t fit like a glove. It fit like skin. More than that. It was bone and muscle and movement. Those things are the hand. And Caesura was the sword. It was the both the name and the thing itself.\nI can\u2019t tell you how I knew this. But I knew it.\nBesides, if I was to be a namer, I decided I could damn well choose the name of my own sword.\nI looked up at Magwyn. \u201cIt is a good name,\u201d I agreed politely, deciding to keep my opinion to myself until I was well gone from Ademre. \u201cI am only wondering how many owners there have been entirely. That is something I should know as well.\u201d\nMagwyn gave me a sour look that said she knew I was patronizing her. But she flipped ahead several pages in her book. Then a few more.\nThen a few more.\n\u201cTwo hundred and thirty-six,\u201d she said. \u201cYou will be the two hundred thirty-seventh.\u201d She flipped back to the beginning of the list. \u201cLet us begin again.\u201d She drew a breath and said. \u201cFirst came Chael, who shaped me in fire for an unknown purpose. He carried me then cast me aside.\u201d", "I fought down the urge to sigh. Even with my trouper\u2019s knack for learning lines it would take long, weary days setting them all to memory.\nThen I realized what this truly meant. If each owner had kept Caesura for ten years, and it had never sat idle for longer than a day or two, that meant Caesura was, at a very conservative estimate, more than two thousand years old.\nI received my next surprise three hours later when I tried to excuse myself for supper. As I stood to leave Magwyn explained I was to remain with her until I learned all of Caesura\u2019s story by heart. Someone would bring us our meals, and there was a room nearby where I could sleep.\nFirst came Chael . . .\n \n"], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-SIX": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-SIX\nThe First Stone\nI SPENT THE NEXT THREE days with Magwyn. It wasn\u2019t bad, especially considering my left hand was still healing, so my ability to talk and fight was rather limited.\nI like to think I did rather well. It would have been easier for me to memorize an entire play than this. A play fits together like a jigsaw. Dialogue moves back and forth. There is a shape to a story.\nBut what I learned from Magwyn was merely a long string of unfamiliar names and unconnected events. It was a laundry list masquerading as a story.\nStill, I learned it all by heart. It was late in the evening of the third day when I recited it back flawlessly to Magwyn. The hardest part was not singing it as I recited. Music carries words over miles and into hearts and memories. Committing Caesura\u2019s history to memory had been much easier when I\u2019d started fitting it to the tune of an old Vintish ballad in my head.\nThe next morning Magwyn demanded I recite it again. After I made it through a second time, she scribbled a note to Shehyn, sealed it in wax, and shooed me out of her cave.\n\u201cWe had not expected Magwyn to be finished with you for several days yet,\u201d Shehyn said, reading the note. \u201cVashet took a trip to Feant and will not be back for at least two days.\u201d\nThat meant I had memorized the Atas twice as quickly as their best estimate. I felt more than a little pride in that.\nShehyn glanced at my left hand and gave the barest frown. \u201cWhen did you have your dressings removed?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cI could not find you at first,\u201d I said. \u201cSo I went to visit Daeln. He said it has healed quite nicely.\u201d I flexed my newly unbandaged left hand and\n \ngestured joyful relief. \u201cThere is hardly any stiffness in the skin, and he reassures me even that will fade soon with proper care.\u201d\nI looked at Shehyn, expecting to see some gesture of approval or satisfaction. Instead I saw exasperated irritation.\n\u201cHave I done something wrong?\u201d I asked. Confused regret. Apology.\nShehyn motioned to my hand. \u201cIt could have been a convenient excuse to postpone your stone trial,\u201d she said. Irritated resignation. \u201cNow we must go ahead with it today, Vashet or no.\u201d\nI felt a familiar anxiety settle back onto me, like a dark bird clenching its claws deep into the muscles of my neck and shoulders. I\u2019d thought the tedium of memorization had been the last of it, but apparently the final shoe was yet to drop. I didn\u2019t like the sound of the term \u201cstone trial,\u201d either.\n\u201cReturn here after midday meal.\u201d Shehyn said. Dismissal.\u201cGo. I have much to prepare before then.\u201d\nI went looking for Penthe. With Vashet gone, she was the only one I knew well enough to ask about the upcoming trial.\nBut she wasn\u2019t in her house, the school, or the baths. Eventually I gave up, stretched, and rehearsed my Ketan, first with Caesura, then without. Then I made my way to the baths and scrubbed away three days of sitting and doing nothing.\nShehyn was waiting for me when I returned after lunch, holding her carved wooden sword. She looked at my empty hands and made an exasperated gesture. \u201cWhere is your dueling sword?\u201d\n\u201cIn my room,\u201d I said. \u201cI did not know I would need it.\u201d\n\u201cRun fetch it,\u201d she said. \u201cThen meet me at the stone hill.\u201d\n\u201cShehyn,\u201d I said. Urgent imploring. \u201cI don\u2019t know where that is. I don\u2019t\nknow anything about the stone trial.\u201d\nSurprise. \u201cVashet never told you?\u201d Disbelief.\nI shook my head. Sincere apology. \u201cWe were focused on other things.\u201d Exasperation. \u201cIt is simple enough,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst you will recite\nSaicere\u2019s Atas for all gathered. Then you will climb the hill. At the first stone, you will fight one from the school who is ranked of the first stone. If you win, you will continue to climb and fight someone of the second stone.\u201d\nShehyn looked at me. \u201cIn your case, this is a formality. Occasionally a student enters the school with exceptional talent. Vashet was one such as this, and she gained the second stone at her first trial.\u201d Blunt honesty. \u201cYou are not such a one. Your Ketan is still poor, and you cannot expect to gain even the", "first stone. The stone hill is east of the baths.\u201d She flicked her hand at me: Hurry.\nThere was a crowd gathered at the foot of the stone hill by the time I arrived, more than a hundred people. Grey homespun and muted colors vastly outnumbered mercenary red, and the low murmur of the crowd\u2019s conversation was audible from a distance.\nThe hill itself wasn\u2019t particularly high, nor was it steep. But the path to the top cut back and forth in a series of switchbacks. At each corner there was a wide, flat space with a large block of grey stone. There were four corners, four stones, and four red-shirted mercenaries. At the top of the hill stood a tall greystone, familiar as a friend. Beside that stood a small figure in blinding white.\nAs I came closer, I caught a smell drifting on the breeze: toasted chestnuts. Only then did I relax. This was pageantry of a sort. While \u201cstone trial\u201d had an intimidating sound to it, I doubted very much that I was going to be brutalized in front of a milling audience while someone sold roasted nuts.\nI entered the crowd and approached the hill. I could see it was Shehyn next to the greystone. I also recognized the heart-shaped face and long, hanging braid of Penthe at the third stone.\nThe crowd parted gently as I walked to the foot of the hill. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a blood-red figure rushing toward me. Alarmed, I turned and saw it was none other than Tempi. He hurried toward me, gesturing a broad enthusiastic greeting.\nI fought the urge to smile and shout his name, settling instead on a gesture of joyful excitement.\nHe came to stand directly in front of me, gripping me by my shoulder and jostling me around playfully, as if congratulating me. But his eyes were intense. Close to his chest his hand said, deception where only I could see. \u201cListen,\u201d he spoke quickly under his breath. \u201cYou cannot win this fight.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Reassurance. \u201cShehyn thinks the same, but I might surprise you.\u201d\nTempi\u2019s grip on my shoulder grew painfully tight. \u201cListen,\u201d he hissed. \u201cLook who is at the first stone.\u201d\n \nI looked over his shoulder. It was Carceret. Her eyes were like knives.\n\u201cShe is full of rage,\u201d Tempi said quietly, gesturing fond affection for the crowd to see. \u201cAs if your admittance to the school was not enough, you have been given her mother\u2019s sword.\u201d\nThat piece of news knocked the wind out of me. My mind flickered to the final piece of the Atas. \u201cLarel was Carceret\u2019s mother?\u201d I asked.\nTempi ran his right hand affectionately through my hair. \u201cYes. She is enraged past reason. I fear she would gladly cripple you, even if it means being thrown from the school.\u201d\nI nodded seriously.\n\u201cShe will try to disarm you. Be wary of it. Do not grapple. If she catches you with Sleeping Bear or Circling Hands, submit quickly. Shout it if you must. If you hesitate or try to break away, she will shatter your arm or pull it from your shoulder. I heard her say this to her sister not an hour ago.\u201d\nSuddenly, Tempi stepped away from me and gestured deferential respect.\nI felt a tapping at my arm and turned to see Magwyn\u2019s wrinkled face. \u201cCome,\u201d she said with quiet authority. \u201cIt is time.\u201d\nI fell into step behind her. As we walked, everyone in the crowd gestured some manner of respect toward her. Magwyn led me to the beginning of the path. There was a block of grey stone, slightly taller than my knee and identical to the others at each corner of the path.\nThe old woman gestured for me to climb up onto the stone. I looked out over the group of Adem and had an unprecedented moment of stage fright.\nBending a bit, I spoke softly to Magwyn. \u201cIs it appropriate for me to raise my voice when reciting this?\u201d I asked her nervously. \u201cI do not mean to be offensive, but if I do not, those in the back will not be able to hear.\u201d\nMagwyn smiled at me for the first time, her wrinkled face suddenly sweet. She patted my hand. \u201cNo one will be offended at a loud voice here,\u201d she said, gesturing considerate moderation. \u201cGive.\u201d\nI unbuckled Saicere and handed it over. Then Magwyn urged me onto the stone.\nI recited the Atas while Magwyn watched. Though I was confident of my memory, it was still nerve-wracking. I wondered what would happen if I skipped an owner or misplaced a name.\nIt took the better part of an hour before I was done, the audience of Adem listening with an almost eerie quiet. When I finished, Magwyn offered her hand, helping me down from the stone as if I were a lady descending from a", "carriage. Then she gestured up the hill.\nI wiped the sweat from my hand and gripped the wooden hilt of my\ndueling sword as I started up the path. Carceret\u2019s reds were strapped tightly across her long arms and broad shoulders. The leather straps she used were wider and thicker than Tempi\u2019s. They looked to be a brighter red, too, and I wonder if she had dyed them especially for today. As I came closer, I saw she had the fading remains of a black eye.\nOnce she saw I was watching, Carceret tossed her wooden sword away in a slow, deliberate motion. She gestured disdain broadly enough so they could see it in the ha\u2019penny seats at the back of the crowd.\nThere was a murmur from the crowd and I stopped walking, uncertain what to do. After a moment\u2019s thought, I lay my own training sword down by the side of the path and continued to walk.\nCarceret waited in the center of a flat, grassy circle about thirty feet across. The ground was soft here, so I wouldn\u2019t ordinarily worry about being thrown. Ordinarily. Vashet had taught me the difference between throwing someone to the ground and throwing someone at the ground. The first was what you did during a polite bout. The second was what you would use in a true fight where the intention was to maim or kill your opponent.\nBefore I came too close, I fell into the now-familiar fighter\u2019s crouch. I raised my hands, bent my knees, and fought the urge to rise up onto the balls of my feet, knowing I would feel quicker, and ruin my balance as a result. I took a deep, steadying breath and slowly moved toward her.\nCarceret fell into a similar crouch, and just as I was coming to the outside limits of her reach, she made a feint toward me. It was only a slight twitch of the hand and shoulder, but, anxious as I was, I fell for it wholeheartedly and skittered away like a startled rabbit.\nCarceret lowered her hands and stood up straight, abandoning her fighting crouch. Amusement, she gestured broadly, invitation. Then she beckoned with both hands. I heard a few pieces of laughter drift up from the crowd below.\nHumiliating as her attitude was, I was eager to take advantage of her lowered guard. I moved forward and made a cautious attempt at Hands like Knives. Too cautious, and she stepped away from it without even needing to lift her hands.\nI knew I was outclassed as a fighter. That meant my only hope was to play on her already hot emotions. If I could infuriate her, she might make mistakes. If she made mistakes, I might be able to win. \u201cFirst came Chael,\u201d I", "said, giving her my widest, most barbaric smile.\nCarceret took a half step closer. \u201cI am going to crush your pretty hands,\u201d\nshe hissed in perfect Aturan. As she spoke she reached out and made a vicious gripping motion at me.\nShe was trying to scare me, make me recoil and lose my balance. And honestly, the raw venom in her voice made me want to do just that.\nBut I was ready. I resisted my reflex to pull back. In doing so I froze for a moment, neither retreating nor advancing.\nOf course, this is what Carceret was truly waiting for, a half-moment\u2019s hesitation as I fought the urge to flee. She closed on me in a single easy step and caught my wrist, her hand tight as a band of iron.\nWithout thinking, I used Celean\u2019s curious two-handed version of Break Lion. Perfect for a small girl struggling against a grown man, or a hopelessly outclassed musician trying to escape an Adem mercenary.\nI regained control of my hand, and the unorthodox movement startled Carceret ever so slightly. I took advantage of it and struck out quickly with Sowing Barley, snapping my knuckles hard against the meat of her inner bicep.\nIt wasn\u2019t a hard punch, I was too close for that. But if I managed to hit the nerve properly, the blow would numb her hand. This wouldn\u2019t just make her weak on her left side, but it would make all the two-handed motions of the Ketan more difficult. A significant advantage.\nSince I was still so close, I immediately followed Sowing Barley with Turn Millstone, giving her a short, firm push to knock her off balance. I managed to get both hands on her, and even pushed her backward by perhaps four inches, but Carceret came nowhere near to losing her balance.\nThen I saw her eyes. I\u2019d thought she\u2019d been angry before, but it was nothing compared to now. Now I\u2019d managed to actually strike her. Not just once, but twice. A barbarian with less than two months of training had struck her twice, while everyone in the school looked on.\nI cannot describe how she looked. And even if I could, it would not impress upon you the truth of things, as her face was still almost entirely impassive. Instead let me say this. I have never seen anyone so furious in my entire life. Not Ambrose. Not Hemme. Not Denna when I criticized her song or the Maer when I defied him. Those angers were pale candles compared to the forge fire burning in Carceret\u2019s eyes.\nBut even in the full flower of her fury, Carceret was perfectly in control.", "She didn\u2019t lash out wildly or snarl at me. She kept her words inside her, burning them like fuel.\nI couldn\u2019t win this fight. But my hands moved automatically, trained by hundreds of hours of practice to take advantage of her nearness. I stepped forward and tried to grab hold of her for Thunder Upward. Her hands snapped out, brushing the attack away. Then she lashed out with Bargeman at the Dock.\nI don\u2019t think she expected it to connect. A more competent opponent would have avoided or blocked it. But I had let myself get slightly wrongfooted, so I was off balance, so I was slow, so her foot caught me in the stomach and pushed.\nBargeman at the Dock isn\u2019t a quick kick meant to break bones. It is a kick that shoves the opponent off balance. As I was already off balance, it pushed me right off my feet. I landed jarringly on my back, then rolled to a stop in a messy tangle of limbs.\nNow some might say that I had taken a bad fall and was obviously too stupefied to find my feet and continue the fight. Others might say that while it was messy, the fall wasn\u2019t quite as hard as all that, and I had certainly found my feet after worse.\nPersonally, I think the line between being stupefied and being wise is sometimes very thin. How thin, I suppose, I will leave to you to decide.", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-SEVEN": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-SEVEN\nAnger\n\u201cWHAT WERE YOU THINKING?\u201d Tempi demanded. Disappointment. Fierce chastisement. \u201cWhat fool sets his sword aside?\u201d\n\u201cShe threw her sword away first!\u201d I protested.\n\u201cOnly to lure you in,\u201d Tempi said. \u201cOnly as a trap.\u201d\nI was buckling Caesura\u2019s scabbard so the hilt hung over my shoulder.\nThere hadn\u2019t been any particular ceremony after I had lost. Magwyn simply returned my sword and smiled at me, patting my hand in a comforting way.\nI watched the crowd slowly dispersing below, and gestured polite disbelief to Tempi. \u201cShould I have kept my sword when she was unarmed?\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d Absolute agreement. \u201cShe is five times the fighter you are. You might have had a chance if you had kept your sword!\u201d\n\u201cTempi is right,\u201d I heard Shehyn\u2019s voice behind me. \u201cKnowing your enemy is in keeping with the Lethani. Once a fight is inevitable, a clever fighter takes any advantage.\u201d I turned and saw her coming down the path. Penthe walked beside her.\nI gestured polite certainty. \u201cIf I had kept my sword and won, people would have thought Carceret was a fool and resented me for gaining a rank I did not deserve. And if I had kept my sword and lost, it would have been humiliating. Neither reflects well on me.\u201d I looked back and forth between Shehyn and Tempi. \u201cAm I wrong in this?\u201d\n\u201cYou are not wrong in this.\u201d Shehyn said. \u201cBut neither is Tempi wrong.\u201d \u201cVictory is always to be sought,\u201d Tempi said. Firm.\nShehyn turned to face him. \u201cSuccess is key,\u201d she said. \u201cVictory is not\nalways needed to succeed.\u201d\nTempi gestured respectful disagreement and opened his mouth to respond,\nbut Penthe spoke first, cutting him off. \u201cKvothe, are you hurt from your fall?\u201d \u201cNot badly,\u201d I said, moving my back gingerly. \u201cA few bruises, perhaps.\u201d \u201cDo you have anything to put on them?\u201d\nI shook my head.", "Penthe stepped forward and took hold of my arm. \u201cI have things at my house. We will leave these two to discuss the Lethani. Someone should tend to your hurts.\u201d She held my arm with her left hand, making her statement curiously empty of any emotional content.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Shehyn said after a moment, and Tempi gestured a hasty agreement . But Penthe was already leading me firmly down the hill.\nWe walked for a quarter mile or so, Penthe holding my arm lightly.\nEventually she spoke in her lightly accented Aturan. \u201cAre you bruised badly enough to need a salve?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cNot really,\u201d I admitted.\n\u201cI thought not,\u201d she said. \u201cBut after I have lost a fight, I rarely wish to have people tell me how I lost it.\u201d She flashed me a small, secret smile.\nI smiled back.\nWe continued to walk, and Penthe kept hold of my arm, subtly guiding us through a grove of trees, then up a steep path carved through a small bluff. Eventually we came to a secluded dell that had a carpet of wild papavlerflower blossoming among the grass. Their loose, blood-red petals were almost exactly the same color as Penthe\u2019s mercenary reds.\n\u201cVashet told me barbarians have strange rituals with your sex,\u201d Penthe said. \u201cShe told me if I wanted to bed you, I should bring you to some flowers.\u201d She gestured around. \u201cThese are the best I could find in this season.\u201d She looked up at me expectantly.\n\u201cAh,\u201d I said. \u201cI expect Vashet was having a bit of a joke with you. Or perhaps a joke with me.\u201d Penthe frowned and I hurried to continue. \u201cBut it is true that among the barbarians there are many rituals that lead up to sex. It is somewhat more complicated there.\u201d\nPenthe gestured sullen irritation. \u201cI should not be surprised,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone tells stories about the barbarians. Some of it is training, so I can move well among you.\u201d Wry however. \u201cSince I have not been out among them yet, they also tell stories to tease me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat sort of stories?\u201d I asked, thinking of what I had heard about the Adem and the Lethani before I had met Tempi.\nShe shrugged, slight embarrassment. \u201cIt is foolishness. They say all the barbarian men are huge.\u201d She gestured far above her head, showing a height of more than seven feet. \u201cNaden told me he went to a town where the barbarians ate a soup made of dirt. They say the barbarians never bathe. They say barbarians drink their own urine, believing it will help them live longer.\u201d", "She shook her head, laughing and gesturing horrified amusement.\n\u201cAre you saying,\u201d I asked slowly, \u201cthat you don\u2019t drink yours?\u201d Penthe froze midlaugh and looked at me, her face and hands showing a\nconfused, apologetic mix of embarrassment, disgust, and disbelief. It was such a bizarre tangle of emotions I couldn\u2019t help but laugh, and I saw her relax when she realized the joke.\n\u201cI understand,\u201d I said. \u201cWe tell similar stories about the Adem.\u201d\nHer eyes lit up. \u201cYou must tell me as I told you. It is fair.\u201d\nGiven Tempi\u2019s reaction when I\u2019d told him of the word-fire and Lethani, I\ndecided to share something else. \u201cThey say those who take the red never have sex. They say you take that energy and put it into your Ketan, and that is why you are such good fighters.\u201d\nPenthe laughed hard at that. \u201cI would have never made the third stone if that were the case,\u201d she said. Wry amusement. \u201cIf keeping from sex gave me my fighting, there would be days I could not make even a fist.\u201d\nI felt my pulse quicken a bit at that.\n\u201cStill,\u201d she said. \u201cI can see where that story comes from. They must think we have no sex because no Adem would bed a barbarian.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d I said, somewhat disappointed. \u201cWhy have you brought me to the flowers then?\u201d\n\u201cYou are now of Ademre,\u201d she said easily. \u201cI expect many will approach you now. You have a sweet face, and it is hard not to be curious about your anger.\u201d\nPenthe paused and glanced significantly downward. \u201cThat is unless you are diseased?\u201d\nI blushed at this. \u201cWhat? No! Of course not!\u201d\n\u201cAre you certain?\u201d\n\u201cI have studied at the Medica,\u201d I said somewhat stiffly. \u201cThe greatest\nschool of medicine in all the world. I know all about the diseases a person might catch, how to spot them and how to treat them.\u201d\nPenthe gave me a skeptical look. \u201cI do not question you in particular. But it is well known that barbarians are quite frequently diseased in their sex.\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cThis is just another foolish story. I assure you the barbarians are no more diseased than the Adem. In fact, I expect we may be less.\u201d\nShe shook her head, her eyes serious. \u201cNo. You are wrong in this. Of a hundred barbarians, how many would you say were so afflicted?\u201d", "It was an easy statistic I knew from the Medica. \u201cOut of every hundred? Perhaps five. More among those who work in brothels or frequent such places, of course.\u201d\nPenthe\u2019s face showed obvious disgust and she shivered. \u201cOf one hundred Adem, none are so afflicted,\u201d she said firmly. Absolute.\n\u201cOh come now.\u201d I held up my hand, making a circle with my fingers. \u201cNone?\u201d\n\u201cNone,\u201d she said with grim certainty. \u201cThe only place we could catch such a thing is from a barbarian, and those who travel are warned.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if you caught a disease from another Adem who had not been careful while traveling?\u201d I asked.\nPenthe\u2019s tiny heart-shaped face went grim, her nostrils flaring. \u201cFrom one of my own?\u201d Vast anger. \u201cIf one of Ademre were to give me a disease, I would be furious. I would shout from the top of a cliff what they had done. I would make their life as painful as a broken bone.\u201d\nShe gestured disgust, brushing at the front of her shirt in the first piece of Adem hand-talk I had ever learned from Tempi. \u201cThen I would make the long trek over the mountains into the Tahl to be cured of it. Even if the trip should take two years and bring no money to the school. And none would think the less of me for that.\u201d\nI nodded to myself. It made sense. Given their attitudes about sex, if it were any other way, disease would run rampant through the population.\nI saw Penthe looking at me expectantly. \u201cThank you for the flowers,\u201d I said.\nShe nodded and stepped closer, looking up at me. Her eyes were excited as she smiled her shy smile. Then her face grew serious. \u201cIs it enough to satisfy your barbarian rituals, or is there more that must be done?\u201d\nI reached down and ran my hand along the smooth skin of her neck, sliding my fingertips under the long braid so they brushed the back of her neck. She closed her eyes and tipped her face up toward mine.\n\u201cThey are lovely, and more than enough,\u201d I said, and bent to kiss her.\n\u201cI was right,\u201d Penthe said with a contented sigh as we lay naked among the flowers. \u201cYou have a fine anger.\u201d I lay on my back, her small body curled\n \nunder my arm, her heart-shaped face resting gently on my chest.\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d I asked. \u201cI think anger might be the wrong\nword.\u201d\n\u201cI mean Vaevin,\u201d she said, using the Ademic term. \u201cIs that the same?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know that word,\u201d I admitted.\n\u201cI think anger is the right word,\u201d she said. \u201cI have spoken with Vashet in\nyour language, and she did not correct me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean by anger, then?\u201d I asked. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t feel\nangry.\u201d\nPenthe lifted her head from my chest and gave me a lazy, satisfied smile.\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said. \u201cI have taken your anger. How could you feel such a way?\u201d\n\u201cAre . . . are you angry then?\u201d I asked, sure I was missing the point entirely.\nPenthe laughed and shook her head. She had undone her long braid and her honey-colored hair hung down the side of her face. It made her look like an entirely different person. That and the lack of the mercenary reds, I supposed. \u201cIt is not that kind of anger. I am glad to have it.\u201d\n\u201cI still do not understand,\u201d I said. \u201cThis could be something barbarians do not know. Explain it to me as if I were a child.\u201d\nShe looked at me for a moment, her eyes serious, then she rolled over onto her stomach so she could face me more easily. \u201cThis anger is not a feeling. It is . . .\u201d She hesitated, frowning prettily. \u201cIt is a desire. It is a making. It is a wanting of life.\u201d\nPenthe looked around, then focused on the grass around us. \u201cAnger is what makes the grass press up through the ground to reach the sun,\u201d she said. \u201cAll things that live have anger. It is the fire in them that makes them want to move and grow and do and make.\u201d She cocked her head. \u201cDoes that make sense to you?\u201d\n\u201cI think so,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd women take the anger from men in sex?\u201d\nShe smiled, nodding. \u201cThat is why afterward a man is so weary. He gives a piece of himself. He collapses. He sleeps.\u201d She glanced down. \u201cOr a part of him sleeps.\u201d\n\u201cNot for long,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThat is because you have a fine, strong anger,\u201d she said proudly. \u201cAs I have already said. I can tell because I have taken a piece of it. I can tell there is more waiting.\u201d", "\u201cThere is,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut what do women do with the anger?\u201d\n\u201cWe use it,\u201d Penthe said simply. \u201cThat is why, afterward, a woman does not always sleep as a man does. She feels more awake. Full of the need to move. Often full of desire for more of what brought her the anger in the first place.\u201d She lowered her head to my chest and bit me playfully, wriggling her naked body against me.\nIt was pleasantly distracting. \u201cDoes this mean women have no anger of their own?\u201d\nShe laughed again. \u201cNo. All things have anger. But women have many uses for their anger. And men have more anger than they can use, too much for their own good.\u201d\n\u201cHow can one have too much of the desire to live and grow and make?\u201d I asked. \u201cIt seems more would be better.\u201d\nPenthe shook her head, brushing her hair back with one hand. \u201cNo. It is like food. One meal is good. Two meals is not better.\u201d She frowned again. \u201cNo. It is more like wine. One cup of wine is good, two is sometimes better, but ten . . . \u201dShe nodded seriously. \u201cThat is very much like anger. A man who grows full of it, it is like a poison in him. He wants too many things. He wants all things. He becomes strange and wrong in his head, violent.\u201d\nShe nodded to herself. \u201cYes. That is why anger is the right word, I think. You can tell a man who has been keeping all his anger to himself. It goes sour in him. It turns against itself and drives him to breaking rather than making.\u201d\n\u201cI can think of men like that,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I can think of women too.\u201d\n\u201cAll things have anger,\u201d she repeated with a shrug. \u201cA stone does not have much compared to a budding tree. It is the same with people. Some have more, or less. Some use it wisely. Some do not.\u201d She gave me a wide smile. \u201cI have a great deal, which is why I am so fond of sex and fierce in my fighting.\u201d She bit at my chest again, less playfully this time, and began to work her way up to my neck.\n\u201cBut if you take the anger from a man in sex,\u201d I said, struggling to concentrate, \u201cdoesn\u2019t that mean the more sex you have, the more you want?\u201d\n\u201cIt is like the water one uses to prime a pump,\u201d she said hotly against my ear. \u201cCome now, I will have all of it, even if it takes us all day and half the night.\u201d\n \nWe eventually moved from the grassy field to the baths, and then to Penthe\u2019s house of two snug rooms built against the side of a bluff. The moon was in the sky and had been watching us for some time through the window, though I doubt we showed her anything she hadn\u2019t seen before.\n\u201cIs that enough for you?\u201d I said breathlessly. We were side by side in her pleasantly capacious bed, the sweat drying off our bodies. \u201cIf you take much more of it, I might not have enough anger left to speak or breathe.\u201d\nMy hand lay on the flat plane of her belly. Her skin was soft and smooth, but when she laughed I could feel the muscles of her stomach jump, going hard as sheets of steel.\n\u201cIt is enough for now,\u201d she said, exhaustion plain in her voice. \u201cIt would upset Vashet if I left you empty as a fruit with all the juice pressed out.\u201d\nDespite my long day, I was oddly wakeful, my thoughts bright and clear. I remembered something she had said earlier. \u201cYou mentioned that a woman has many uses for her anger. What use does a woman have for it that a man does not?\u201d\n\u201cWe teach,\u201d she said. \u201cWe give names. We track the days and tend to the smooth turning of things. We plant. We make babies.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cMany things.\u201d\n\u201cA man can do those things as well,\u201d I said.\nPenthe chuckled. \u201cYou have the wrong word,\u201d she said, rubbing at my chin. \u201cA beard is what a man makes. A baby is something different, and that you have no part of.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t carry the baby,\u201d I said, slightly offended. \u201cBut still, we play our part in making it.\u201d\nPenthe turned to look at me, smiling as if I had made a joke. Then her smile faded. She propped herself up on her elbow and looked at me for another long moment. \u201cAre you in serious?\u201d\nSeeing my perplexed expression, her eyes grew wide with amazement and she sat upright on the bed. \u201cIt is true!\u201d she said. \u201cYou believe in man-mothers !\u201d She giggled, covering the bottom half of her face with both hands. \u201cI never believed it was true!\u201d She lowered her left hand, revealing an excited grin as she gestured amazed delight.\nI felt I should be irritated, but I couldn\u2019t quite muster the energy. Perhaps some of what she said about men giving away their anger had some truth to", "it. \u201cWhat is a man-mother?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cAre you not making a joke?\u201d she asked, one hand still half-covering her\nsmile. \u201cDo you truly believe a man puts a baby in a woman?\u201d\n\u201cWell . . . yes,\u201d I said a little awkwardly. \u201cIn a manner of speaking. It takes\na man and a woman to make a baby. A mother and a father.\u201d\n\u201cYou have a word for it!\u201d she said, delighted. \u201cThey told me this too. With\nthe stories of dirt soup. But I never thought it a real story!\u201d\nI sat up myself at this point, growing concerned. \u201cYou do know how\nbabies are made, don\u2019t you?\u201d I asked, gesturing serious earnestness. \u201cWhat we have been doing for most of the day is what makes a baby.\u201d\nShe looked at me for a moment in stunned silence, then dissolved helplessly into laughter, trying to speak several times only to have it overwhelm her again when she looked up at the expression on my face.\nPenthe put her hands on her belly, prodding it as if puzzled. \u201cWhere is my baby?\u201d She looked down at her flat belly. \u201cPerhaps I have been sexing wrong these years.\u201d When she laughed, the muscles across her stomach flickered, making a pattern like a turtle\u2019s shell. \u201cI should have a hundred babies if what you say is true. Five hundred babies!\u201d\n\u201cIt does not happen every time there is sex,\u201d I said. \u201cThere are only certain times when a woman is ripe for a baby.\u201d\n\u201cAnd have you done this?\u201d she asked, looking at me with mock seriousness while a smile tugged at her mouth. \u201cHave you made a baby with a woman?\u201d\n\u201cI have been careful not to do such a thing,\u201d I said. \u201cThere is an herb called silphium. I chew it every day, and it keeps me from putting a baby in a woman.\u201d\nPenthe shook her head. \u201cThis is more of your barbarian sex rituals,\u201d she said. \u201cDoes bringing a man to the flowers also make a baby where you come from?\u201d\nI decided to take a different tack. \u201cIf men do not help with making babies, how do you explain that babies look like their fathers?\u201d\n\u201cBabies look like angry old men,\u201d Penthe said. \u201cAll bald and with . . . \u201d She hesitated, touching her cheek. \u201c. . . with face lines. Perhaps the old men are the only ones making babies then?\u201d She smirked.\n\u201cWhat about kittens?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou have seen a litter of kittens. When a white cat and a black cat have sex, you get kittens both white and black. And kittens of both colors.\u201d", "\u201cAlways?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cNot always.\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut most times.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if there is a yellow kitten?\u201d she asked.\nBefore I could put together an answer, she waved the question away.\n\u201cKittens have little to do with this,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not like animals. We do not go into season. We do not lay eggs. We do not make cocoons, or fruit, or seeds. We are not dogs or frogs or trees.\u201d\nPenthe gave me a serious look. \u201cYou are committing a false thinking. You could as easily say two stones make baby stones by banging against each other until a piece breaks off. Therefore two people make baby peoples in the same way.\u201d\nI fumed, but she was right. I was committing a fallacy of analogy. It was faulty logic.\nOur conversation continued along this vein for some time. I asked her if she had ever known a woman to get pregnant who had not had sex in the previous months. She said she didn\u2019t know of any woman who would willingly go three months without sex, except those who were traveling among the barbarians, or very ill, or very old.\nEventually Penthe waved a hand to stop me, gesturing exasperation. \u201cDo you hear your own excuses? Sex makes babies, but not always. Babies look like man-mothers, but not always. The sex must be at the right time, but not always. There are plants that make it more likely, or less likely.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cYou must realize what you say is thin as a net. You keep sewing new threads, hoping it will hold water. But hoping does not make it true.\u201d\nSeeing me frown, she took my hand and gestured comfort into it as she had before in the dining hall, all the laughter gone out of her face. \u201cI can see you think this truly. I can understand why barbarian men would want to believe it. It must be comforting to think you are important in this way. But it is simply not.\u201d\nPenthe looked at me with something close to pity. \u201cSometimes a woman ripens. It is a natural thing, and men have no part in it. That is why more women ripen in the fall, like fruit. That is why more women ripen here in Haert, where it is better to have a child.\u201d\nI tried to think of some other convincing argument, but none would come to mind. It was frustrating.\nSeeing my expression, Penthe squeezed my hand and gestured concession. \u201cPerhaps it is different for barbarian women,\u201d she said.", "\u201cYou are only saying that to make me feel better,\u201d I said sullenly and was overcome with a jaw-popping yawn.\n\u201cI am,\u201d she admitted. Then she gave me a gentle kiss and pushed at my shoulders, encouraging me to lie back down on the bed.\nI did, and she nestled into the crook of my arm again, resting her head on my shoulder. \u201cIt must be hard to be a man,\u201d she said softly. \u201cA woman knows she is part of the world. We are full of life. A woman is the flower and the fruit. We move through time as part of our children. But a man . . .\u201d She turned her head and looked up at me with gentle pity in her eyes. \u201cYou are an empty branch. You know when you die, you will leave nothing of any import behind.\u201d\nPenthe stroked my chest fondly. \u201cI think that is why you are so full of anger. Maybe you do not have more than women. Maybe the anger in you simply has no place to go. Maybe it is desperate to leave some mark. It hammers at the world. It drives you to rash action. To bickering. To rage. You paint and build and fight and tell stories that are bigger than the truth.\u201d\nShe gave a contented sigh and rested her head on my shoulder, snugging herself firmly into the circle of my arm. \u201cI am sorry to tell you this thing. You are a good man, and a pretty thing. But still, you are only a man. All you have to offer the world is your anger.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-EIGHT": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-EIGHT\nNames\nIT WAS THE DAY that I would either stay or leave. I sat with Vashet on a green hill, watching the sun rise out of the clouds to the east.\n\u201cSaicere means to fly, to catch, to break,\u201d Vashet said softly, repeating herself for the hundredth time. \u201cYou must remember all the hands that have held her. Many hands, all following the Lethani. You must never use her in an improper way.\u201d\n\u201cI promise,\u201d I said for the hundredth time, then hesitated before bringing up something that had been bothering me. \u201cBut Vashet, you used your sword to trim the willow branch you beat me with. I saw you use it to hold your window open once.You pare your nails with it . . .\u201d\nVashet gave me a blank look. \u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that improper?\u201d I asked.\nShe cocked her head, then laughed. \u201cYou mean I should only use it for\nfighting?\u201d\nI gestured obvious implication.\n\u201cA sword is sharp,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a tool. I carry it constantly, how is using\nit improper?\u201d\n\u201cIt seems disrespectful, \u201d I clarified.\n\u201cYou respect a thing by putting it to good use,\u201d she said. \u201cIt may be years\nbefore I return to the barbarian lands and fight. How does it harm my sword if it cuts kindling and carrots in the meantime?\u201d Vashet\u2019s eyes grew serious. \u201cTo carry a sword your whole life, knowing it was only for killing . . .\u201d She shook her head. \u201cWhat would that do to a person\u2019s mind? It would be a horrible thing.\u201d\nVashet had returned to Haert last night, dismayed that she had missed my stone trial. She said I was right to lay aside my sword when Carceret did, and that I had made her proud.\nYesterday, Shehyn had formally invited me to stay and train at the school. In theory, I already had earned that right, but everyone knew that was more", "of a political fiction than anything. Her offer was a flattering one, an opportunity I knew I would likely never have again.\nWe watched a boy herd a flock of goats down the side of a hill. \u201cVashet, is it true that the Adem have no concept of fatherhood?\u201d\nVashet nodded easily, then paused. \u201cTell me you did not embarrass both of us by talking about this with everyone while I was gone,\u201d she said with a sigh.\n\u201cOnly with Penthe,\u201d I said. \u201cShe thought it was the funniest thing she had heard in ten months\u2019 time.\u201d\n\u201cIt is fairly amusing at that,\u201d Vashet said, her mouth curving a little.\n\u201cIt\u2019s true then?\u201d I asked. \u201cEven you believe this? You\u2019ve . . .\u201d\nVashet held up a hand and I trailed off. \u201cPeace,\u201d she said. \u201cThink whatever\nyou wish about your man-mothers. It is all the same to me.\u201d She gave a soft smile of remembrance. \u201cMy poet king actually believed a woman was nothing more than the ground in which a man might plant a baby.\u201d\nVashet made an amused huffing sound that wasn\u2019t quite a laugh. \u201cHe was so sure he was right. Nothing could sway him. Years ago I decided arguing such things with a barbarian is a long, weary waste of my time.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cThink what you want about making babies. Believe in demons. Pray to a goat. So long as it doesn\u2019t bruise me, why should I bother myself?\u201d\nI chewed it over for a moment. \u201cThere\u2019s wisdom in that,\u201d I said.\nShe nodded.\n\u201cBut either a man helps with a baby or he does not,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cThere\ncan be many opinions on a thing, but there is only one truth.\u201d\nVashet smiled lazily. \u201cAnd if the pursuit of truth was my goal, that would\nconcern me.\u201d She gave a long yawn, stretching like a happy cat. \u201cInstead I will focus on the joy in my heart, the prosperity of the school, and understanding the Lethani. If I have time left after that, I will put it toward worrying on the truth.\u201d\nWe watched the sunrise for a while longer in silence. It occurred to me Vashet was quite a different person when she wasn\u2019t struggling to cram the Ketan and all of Ademic into my head as quickly as possible.\n\u201cThat said,\u201d Vashet added, \u201cif you persist in clinging to your barbarian beliefs about man-mothers, you would do well to keep quiet about it. Amusement is the best you can hope for. Most will simply assume you an idiot for thinking such things.\u201d\nI nodded. After a long moment, I decided to finally ask the question I had", "been holding off for days. \u201cMagwyn called me Maedre. What does it mean?\u201d \u201cIt is your name,\u201d she said. \u201cSpeak of it to no one.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a secret thing?\u201d I asked.\nShe nodded. \u201cIt is a thing for you and your teachers and Magwyn. It would\nbe dangerous to let others know what it is.\u201d\n\u201cHow could it be dangerous?\u201d\nVashet looked at me as if I were daft. \u201cWhen you know a name you have\npower over it. Surely you know this?\u201d\n\u201cBut I know your name, and Shehyn\u2019s and Tempi\u2019s. What danger is in\nthat?\u201d\nShe waved a hand. \u201cNot those names. Deep names. Tempi is not the name\nhe was given by Magwyn. Just as Kvothe is not yours. Deep names have meanings.\u201d\nI already knew what Vashet\u2019s name meant. \u201cWhat does Tempi mean?\u201d\n\u201cTempi means \u2018little iron.\u2019 Tempa means iron, and it means to strike iron, and it means angry. Shehyn gave him that name years ago. He was a most troublesome student.\u201d\n\u201cIn Aturan temper means angry.\u201d I pointed it out rather excitedly, amazed at the coincidence. \u201cAnd it is also something you do with iron when forging it into steel.\u201d\nVashet shrugged, unimpressed. \u201cThat is the way of names. Tempi is a small name, and still it holds much. That is why you should not speak of yours, even to me.\u201d\n\u201cBut I do not know your language well enough to tell what it means myself,\u201d I protested. \u201cA man should know the meaning of his own name.\u201d\nVashet hesitated, then relented. \u201cIt means flame, and thunder, and broken tree.\u201d\nI thought for a while and decided I liked it. \u201cWhen Magwyn gave it to me, you seemed surprised. Why is that?\u201d\n\u201cIt is not proper for me to comment on another\u2019s name.\u201d Absolute refusal. Her gesture was so sharp it almost hurt to look at. She came to her feet, then brushed her hands against her pants. \u201cCome, it is time you gave your answer to Shehyn.\u201d\n \nShehyn motioned for us to sit as we entered her room. Then she took a seat herself, startling me by showing the smallest of smiles. It was a terribly flattering gesture of familiarity. \u201cHave you decided?\u201d she asked.\nI nodded. \u201cI thank you, Shehyn, but I cannot stay. I must return to Severen to speak with the Maer. Tempi fulfilled his obligation when the road was made safe, but I am bound to return and explain everything that happened.\u201d I thought of Denna as well, but didn\u2019t mention her.\nShehyn gestured an elegant mingling of approval and regret. \u201cFulfilling one\u2019s duty is of the Lethani.\u201d She gave me a serious look. \u201cRemember, you have a sword and a name, but you must not hire yourself out as if you had taken the red.\u201d\n\u201cVashet has explained everything to me,\u201d I said. Reassurance. \u201cI will make arrangements for my sword to be returned to Haert if I am killed. I will not teach the Ketan or wear the red.\u201d Carefully attentive curiosity. \u201cBut I am permitted to tell others I have studied fighting with you?\u201d\nReserved agreement. \u201cYou may say you have studied with us. But not that you are one of us.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd not that I am equal to you.\u201d\nShehyn gestured content satisfaction. Then her hands shifted and she made a small gesture of embarrassed admission. \u201cThis is not entirely a gift,\u201d she said. \u201cYou will be a better fighter than many barbarians. If you fight and win, the barbarians will think: Kvothe studied only slightly the Adem\u2019s arts, and still he is formidable. How much more skilled must they themselves be?\u201d However. \u201cIf you fight and lose, they will think: He only learned a piece of what the Adem know.\u201d\nThe old woman\u2019s eyes twinkled ever so slightly. She gestured amusement. \u201cNo matter what, our reputation thrives. This serves Ademre.\u201d\nI nodded. Willing acceptance. \u201cIt will not hurt my reputation either,\u201d I said. Understatement.\nThere was a pause in the conversation, then Shehyn gestured solemn importance. \u201cWhen we spoke before, you asked me of the Rhinta. Do you remember?\u201d Shehyn asked. From the corner of my eye I saw Vashet shift uncomfortably in her seat.\nSuddenly excited, I nodded.\n\u201cI have remembered a story of such. Would you like to hear it?\u201d\nI gestured extreme eager interest.\n\u201cIt is an old story, old as Ademre. It is always told the same. Are you ready", "to hear it?\u201d Profound formality. There was a hint of ritual in her voice.\nI nodded again. Pleading entreaty.\n\u201cAs with all things, there are rules. I will tell this story once. After, you\nmay not speak of it. After, you may not ask questions.\u201d Shehyn looked back and forth between Vashet and myself. Grave seriousness. \u201cNot until you have slept one thousand nights may you speak on this. Not until you have traveled one thousand miles may you ask questions. Knowing this, are you willing to hear it?\u201d\nI nodded a third time, my excitement rising in me.\nShehyn spoke with great formality. \u201cOnce there was a great realm peopled by great people. They were not Ademre. They were what Ademre was before we became ourselves.\n\u201cBut at this time they were themselves, the women and men fair and strong. They sang songs of power and fought as well as Ademre do.\n\u201cThese people had a great empire. The name of the empire is forgotten. It is not important as the empire has fallen, and since that time the land has broken and the sky changed.\n\u201cIn the empire there were seven cities and one city. The names of the seven cities are forgotten, for they are fallen to treachery and destroyed by time. The one city was destroyed as well, but its name remains. It was called Tariniel.\n\u201cThe empire had an enemy, as strength must have. But the enemy was not great enough to pull it down. Not by pulling or pushing was the enemy strong enough to drag it down. The enemy\u2019s name is remembered, but it will wait.\n\u201cSince not by strength could the enemy win, he moved like a worm in fruit. The enemy was not of the Lethani. He poisoned seven others against the empire, and they forgot the Lethani. Six of them betrayed the cities that trusted them. Six cities fell and their names are forgotten.\n\u201cOne remembered the Lethani, and did not betray a city. That city did not fall. One of them remembered the Lethani and the empire was left with hope. With one unfallen city. But even the name of that city is forgotten, buried in time.\n\u201cBut seven names are remembered. The name of the one and of the six who follow him. Seven names have been carried through the crumbling of empire, through the broken land and changing sky. Seven names are remembered through the long wandering of Ademre. Seven names have been remembered, the names of the seven traitors. Remember them and know", "them by their seven signs:\nCyphus bears the blue flame. Stercus is in thrall of iron. Ferule chill and dark of eye. Usnea lives in nothing but decay. Grey Dalcenti never speaks.\nPale Alenta brings the blight. Last there is the lord of seven: Hated. Hopeless. Sleepless. Sane. Alaxel bears the shadow\u2019s hame.", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-NINE": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-NINE\nInterlude\u2014Din of Whispering\n\u201cRESHI!\u201d BAST CRIED OUT, his face stricken. \u201cNo! Stop!\u201d He held out his hands as if he would press them against the innkeeper\u2019s mouth. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t say such things!\u201d\nKvothe smiled in a humorless way. \u201cBast, who taught you your name lore in the first place?\u201d\n\u201cNot you, Reshi.\u201d Bast shook his head. \u201cThere are things every Fae child knows. It\u2019s never good to speak such things aloud. Not ever.\u201d\n\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d Kvothe prompted in his best teacher\u2019s voice.\n\u201cBecause some things can tell when their names are spoken,\u201d Bast swallowed. \u201cThey can tell where they\u2019re spoken.\u201d\nKvothe gave a somewhat exasperated sigh. \u201cThere\u2019s small harm in saying a name once, Bast.\u201d He sat back in his chair. \u201cWhy do you think the Adem have their traditions surrounding that particular story? Only once and no questions after?\u201d\nBast\u2019s eyes narrowed thoughtfully, and Kvothe gave him a small, tight smile. \u201cExactly. Trying to find someone who speaks your name once is like tracking a man through a forest from a single footprint.\u201d\nChronicler spoke up hesitantly, as if afraid of interrupting. \u201cCan such a thing really be done?\u201d he asked. \u201cTruthfully?\u201d\nKvothe nodded grimly. \u201cI expect that\u2019s how they found my troupe when I was young.\u201d\nChronicler looked around nervously, then frowned and made an obvious effort to stop. The result was that he sat very still, looking every bit as nervous as before. \u201cDoes that mean they might come here? You\u2019ve certainly been talking about them enough. . . .\u201d\nKvothe made a dismissive gesture. \u201cNo. Names are the key. Real names. Deep names. And I have been avoiding them for just that reason. My father was a great one for details. He had been asking questions and digging up old stories about the Chandrian for years. I expect he stumbled onto a few of their", "old names and worked them into his song. . . .\u201d\nUnderstanding washed over Chronicler\u2019s face. \u201c. . . and then rehearsed it\nagain and again.\u201d\nThe innkeeper gave a faint, fond smile. \u201cEndlessly, if I knew him at all. I\nhave no doubt he and my mother did their solid best to work every tiny burr out of their song before they made it public. They were perfectionists.\u201d He gave a tired sigh. \u201cTo the Chandrian, it must have been like someone constantly lighting a signal fire. I expect the only thing that kept them safe for so long was that we were constantly traveling.\u201d\nBast broke in again. \u201cWhich is why you shouldn\u2019t say such things, Reshi.\u201d\nKvothe frowned. \u201cI have slept my thousand nights and traveled several thousand miles since then, Bast. It is safe to say them once. With all the hell that\u2019s breaking loose in the world these days you can believe people are telling old stories more often. If the Chandrian are listening for names, I don\u2019t doubt they\u2019ve got a slow din of whispering from Arueh to the Circle Sea.\u201d\nBast\u2019s expression made it clear he was less than reassured.\n\u201cBesides,\u201d Kvothe said with a bit of a weary sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have them written down. They may prove useful to someone someday.\u201d\n\u201cStill Reshi, you should be more careful.\u201d\n\u201cWhat have I been these last years except for careful, Bast?\u201d Kvothe said, his irritation finally bubbling to the surface. \u201cWhat good has it done me? Besides, if what you say about the Cthaeh is true, then things will end in tears no matter what I do. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\nBast opened his mouth, then closed it, obviously at a loss. Then he darted a look toward Chronicler, his eyes pleading for support.\nSeeing this, Kvothe turned to look at Chronicler as well, raising an eyebrow curiously.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know in the least,\u201d Chronicler said, looking down as he opened his satchel and brought out an ink-stained piece of cloth. \u201cBoth of you have seen the full extent of my naming prowess: Iron. And that is a fluke by all accounts. Master Namer declared me an utter waste of his time.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds familiar,\u201d Kvothe murmured.\nChronicler shrugged. \u201cIn my case I took him at his word.\u201d\n\u201cCan you remember the excuse he gave you?\u201d\n\u201cHe had many specific criticisms: I knew too many words. I\u2019d never been\nhungry. I was too soft. . . .\u201d Chronicler\u2019s hands were busy cleaning the nib of his pen. \u201cI felt he made his overall position clear when he said, \u2018Who would", "have thought a papery little scriv like you could have any iron in him at all?\u2019\u201d Kvothe\u2019s mouth quirked into a sympathetic smile. \u201cDid he really?\u201d Chronicler shrugged. \u201cHe called me a twat, actually. I was trying not to\noffend the innocent ears of our young friend here.\u201d He nodded at Bast. \u201cFrom what I can tell, he\u2019s had a rough day.\u201d\nKvothe smiled in full now. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame we weren\u2019t ever at the University at the same time.\u201d\nChronicler gave the nib one last rub against the soft cloth and held it up to the fading light from the inn\u2019s window. \u201cNot really,\u201d he said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have liked me. I was a papery little twat. And spoiled. And full of myself.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s changed since then?\u201d Kvothe asked.\nChronicler blew air through his nose dismissively. \u201cNot much, depending who you ask. But I like to think I\u2019ve had my eyes opened a bit.\u201d He screwed the nib carefully back into his pen.\n\u201cAnd how did that happen, exactly?\u201d Kvothe asked.\nChronicler looked across the table, seeming surprised at the question. \u201cExactly ?\u201d he asked. \u201cTelling a story isn\u2019t what I\u2019m here for.\u201d He tucked the cloth back into his satchel. \u201cIn brief, I had a snit and left the University looking for greener pasture. Best thing I ever did. I learned more from a month on the road than I had in three years of classes.\u201d\nKvothe nodded. \u201cTeccam said the same thing: No man is brave that has never walked a hundred miles. If you want to know the truth of who you are, walk until not a person knows your name. Travel is the great leveler, the great teacher, bitter as medicine, crueler than mirror-glass. A long stretch of road will teach you more about yourself than a hundred years of quiet introspection.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY\nWine and Water\nSAYING MY FAREWELLS IN Haert took an entire day. I shared a meal with Vashet and Tempi and let both of them give me more advice than I needed or desired. Celean cried a bit, and told me she would come visit me when she finally took the red. We bouted one final time, and I suspect she let me win.\nLastly, I spent a pleasant evening with Penthe that turned into a pleasant night and, eventually, into a pleasant late night. I did manage to catch a few hours of sleep in the pale hours before dawn.\nI grew up among the Ruh, so I am endlessly amazed how quickly a person can put down roots in a place. Though I had been in Haert less than two months, it was hard to leave.\nStill, it felt good to be back on the road again, heading toward Alveron and Denna. It was time I collected my reward for a job well done and delivered an earnest and rather belated apology.\nFive days later I was walking one of those long, lonely stretches of road you only find in the low hills of eastern Vintas. I was, as my father used to say, on the edge of the map.\nI had only passed one or two travelers all day and not a single inn. The thought of sleeping outdoors wasn\u2019t particularly troubling, but I had been eating from my pockets for a couple days, and a warm meal would have been a welcome thing.\nNight had nearly fallen, and I had given up hope of something decent in my stomach when I spotted a line of white smoke trailing into the twilight sky ahead of me. I took it for a farmhouse at first. Then I heard a faint strain of music and my hopes for a bed and a hearth-hot meal began to rise.\n \nBut as I came around a curve in the road, I, found a surprise better than any roadside inn.Through the trees I saw a tall campfire flickering between two achingly familiar wagons. Men and women lounged about, talking. One strummed a lute, while another tapped a small tabor idly against his leg. Others were pitching a tent between two trees while an older woman set a tripod over the fire.\nTroupers. What\u2019s better, I recognized familiar markings on the side of one of the wagons. To me they stood out more brightly than the fire. Those signs meant these were true troupers. My family, the Edema Ruh.\nAs I stepped from the trees, one of the men gave a shout, and before I could draw breath to speak there were three swords pointing at me. The sudden stillness after the music and chatter was more than slightly unnerving.\nA handsome man with a black beard and a silver earring took a slow step forward, never taking the tip of his sword off my eye. \u201cOtto!\u201d he shouted into the woods behind me. \u201cIf you\u2019re napping I swear on my mother\u2019s milk I\u2019ll gut you. Who the hell are you?\u201d\nThe last was directed at me. But before I could respond, a voice came out of the trees. \u201cI\u2019m right here, Alleg, as . . . Who\u2019s that? How in the God\u2019s name did he get past me?\u201d\nWhen they\u2019d drawn their swords on me, I\u2019d raised my hands. It\u2019s a good habit to have when anyone points something sharp at you. Nevertheless I was smiling as I spoke. \u201cSorry to startle you, Alleg.\u201d\n\u201cSave it,\u201d he said coldly. \u201cYou have one breath left to tell me why you were sneaking around our camp.\u201d\nI had no need to talk, and instead turned so everyone by the fire could see the lute case slung across my back.\nThe change in Alleg\u2019s attitude was immediate. He relaxed and sheathed his sword. The others followed suit as he smiled and approached me, laughing.\nI laughed too. \u201cOne family.\u201d\n\u201cOne family.\u201d He shook my hand and turned toward the fire, shouting, \u201cBest behavior everyone. We have a guest tonight!\u201d There was a low cheer, and everyone went busily back to whatever they had been doing before I arrived.\nA thick-bodied man wearing a sword stomped out of the trees. \u201cI\u2019ll be damned if he came past me, Alleg. He\u2019s probably from ...\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s from our family,\u201d Alleg interjected smoothly.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Otto said, obviously taken aback. He looked at my lute. \u201cWelcome", "then.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go past, actually,\u201d I lied. When it was dark, my shaed made me\nvery difficult to see. But that wasn\u2019t his fault, and I didn\u2019t want to get him in trouble. \u201cI heard the music and circled around. I thought you might be a different troupe, and I was going to surprise them.\u201d\nOtto gave Alleg a pointed look, then turned and stomped back into the woods.\nAlleg put his arm around my shoulders. \u201cMight I offer you a drink?\u201d\n\u201cA little water, if you can spare it.\u201d\n\u201cNo guest drinks water by our fire,\u201d he protested. \u201cOnly our best wine will\ntouch your lips.\u201d\n\u201cThe water of the Edema is sweeter than wine to those who have been\nupon the road.\u201d I smiled at him.\n\u201cThen have water and wine, each to your desire.\u201d He led me to one of the\nwagons, where there was a water barrel.\nFollowing a tradition older than time, I drank a ladle of water and used a\nsecond to wash my hands and face. Patting my face dry with the sleeve of my shirt, I looked up at him and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be home again.\u201d\nHe clapped me on the back. \u201cCome. Let me introduce you to the rest of your family.\u201d\nFirst were two men of about twenty, both with scruffy beards. \u201cFren and Josh are our two best singers, excepting myself of course.\u201d I shook their hands.\nNext were the two men playing instruments around the fire. \u201cGaskin plays lute. Laren does pipes and tabor.\u201d They smiled at me. Laren struck the head of the tabor with his thumb, and the drum made a mellow tum.\n\u201cThere\u2019s Tim.\u201d Alleg pointed across the fire to a tall, grim man oiling a sword. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve already met Otto. They keep us from falling into danger on the road.\u201d Tim nodded, looking up briefly from his sword.\n\u201cThis is Anne.\u201d Alleg gestured to an older woman with a pinched expression and grey hair pulled back in a bun. \u201cShe keeps us fed and plays mother to us all.\u201d Anne continued to cut carrots, ignoring both of us.\n\u201cAnd far from last is our own sweet Kete, who holds the key to all our hearts.\u201d Kete had hard eyes and a mouth like a thin line, but her expression softened a little when I kissed her hand.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s everyone,\u201d Alleg said with a smile and a little bow. \u201cYour name is?\u201d", "\u201cKvothe.\u201d\n\u201cWelcome, Kvothe. Rest yourself and be at your ease. Is there anything we can do for you?\u201d\n\u201cA bit of that wine you mentioned earlier?\u201d I smiled.\nHe touched the heel of his hand to his forehead. \u201cOf course! Or would you prefer ale?\u201d\nI nodded, and he fetched me a mug.\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d I said after tasting it, seating myself on a convenient stump. He tipped an imaginary hat. \u201cThank you. We were lucky enough to nick it\non our way through Levinshir a couple days ago. How has the road been treating you of late?\u201d\nI stretched backward and sighed. \u201cNot bad for a lone minstrel.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cI take advantage of what opportunities present themselves. I have to be careful since I\u2019m alone.\u201d\nAlleg nodded wisely. \u201cThe only safety we have is in numbers,\u201d he admitted, then nodded to my lute. \u201cWould you favor us with a bit of a song while we\u2019re waiting for Anne to finish dinner?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d I said, setting down my drink. \u201cWhat would you like to hear?\u201d \u201cCan you play \u2018Leave the Town, Tinker\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cCan I?You tell me.\u201d I lifted my lute from its case and began to play. By\nthe chorus, everyone had stopped what they were doing to listen. I even caught sight of Otto near the edge of the trees as he left his lookout to peer toward the fire.\nWhen I was done, everyone applauded enthusiastically. \u201cYou can play it,\u201d Alleg laughed. Then his expression became serious, and he tapped a finger to his mouth. \u201cHow would you like to walk the road with us for a while?\u201d he asked after a moment. \u201cWe could use another player.\u201d\nI took a moment to consider it. \u201cWhich way are you heading?\u201d \u201cEasterly,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m bound for Severen,\u201d I said.\nAlleg shrugged. \u201cWe can make it to Severen,\u201d he said. \u201cSo long as you\ndon\u2019t mind taking the long way around.\u201d\n\u201cI have been away from the family for a long time,\u201d I admitted, looking at\nthe familiar sights around the fire.\n\u201cOne is a bad number for an Edema on the road,\u201d Alleg said persuasively,\nrunning a finger along the edge of his dark beard. I sighed. \u201cAsk me again in the morning.\u201d", "He slapped my knee, grinning. \u201cGood! That means we have all night to convince you.\u201d\nI replaced my lute and excused myself for a call of nature. Coming back, I knelt next to Anne where she sat near the fire. \u201cWhat are you making for us, mother?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cStew,\u201d she said shortly.\nI smiled. \u201cWhat\u2019s in it?\u201d\nAnne squinted at me. \u201cLamb,\u201d she said, as if daring me to challenge the\nfact.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long while since I\u2019ve had lamb, mother. Could I have a taste?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll wait, same as everyone else,\u201d she said sharply.\n\u201cNot even a small taste?\u201d I wheedled, giving her my best ingratiating\nsmile.\nThe old woman drew a breath, then shrugged it away. \u201cFine,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBut it won\u2019t be my fault if your stomach sets to aching.\u201d\nI laughed. \u201cNo, mother. It won\u2019t be your fault.\u201d I reached for the\nlonghandled wooden spoon and drew it out. After blowing on it, I took a bite. \u201cMother!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cThis is the best thing to touch my lips in a full year.\u201d\n\u201cHmph,\u201d she said, squinting at me.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first truth, mother,\u201d I said earnestly. \u201cAnyone who does not enjoy this fine stew is hardly one of the Ruh in my opinion.\u201d\nAnne turned back to stir the pot and shooed me away, but her expression wasn\u2019t as sharp as it had been before.\nAfter stopping by the keg to refill my mug, I returned to my seat. Gaskin leaned forward. \u201cYou\u2019ve given us a song. Is there anything you\u2019d like to hear?\u201d\n\u201cHow about \u2018Piper Wit\u2019?\u201d I asked.\nHis brow furrowed. \u201cI don\u2019t recognize that one.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s about a clever Ruh who outwits a farmer.\u201d\nGaskin shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid not.\u201d\nI bent to pick up my lute. \u201cLet me. It\u2019s a song every one of us should\nknow.\u201d\n\u201cPick something else,\u201d Laren protested. \u201cI\u2019ll play you something on the\npipes. You\u2019ve played for us once already tonight.\u201d\nI smiled at him. \u201cI forgot you piped. You\u2019ll like this one,\u201d I assured him,\n\u201cPiper\u2019s the hero. Besides, you\u2019re feeding my belly, I\u2019ll feed your ears.\u201d Before they could raise any more objections, I started to play, quick and light.", "They laughed through the whole thing. From the beginning when Piper kills the farmer, to the end when he seduces the dead man\u2019s wife and daughter. I left off the last two verses where the townsfolk kill Piper.\nLaren wiped his eyes after I was done. \u201cHeh.You\u2019re right, Kvothe. I\u2019m better off knowing that one. Besides . . .\u201d He shot a look at Kete where she sat across the fire. \u201cIt\u2019s an honest song. Women can\u2019t keep their hands off a piper.\u201d\nKete snorted derisively and rolled her eyes.\nWe talked of small things until Anne announced the stew was done. Everyone fell to, breaking the silence only to compliment Anne on her cooking.\n\u201cHonestly, Anne,\u201d Alleg asked after his second bowl. \u201cDid you lift a little pepper back in Levinshir?\u201d\nAnne looked smug. \u201cWe all need our secrets, dear,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t press a lady.\u201d\nI asked Alleg, \u201cHave times been good for you and yours?\u201d\n\u201cOh certainly,\u201d he said between mouthfuls. \u201cThree days ago Levinshir was especially good to us.\u201d He winked. \u201cYou\u2019ll see how good later.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d\n\u201cIn fact.\u201d He leaned forward conspiratorially. \u201cWe\u2019ve done so well that I feel quite generous. Generous enough to offer you anything you\u2019d like. Anything at all. Ask and it is yours.\u201d He leaned closer and said in a stage whisper, \u201cI want you to know this is a blatant attempt to bribe you into staying on with us. We would make a thick purse off that lovely voice of yours.\u201d\n\u201cNot to mention the songs he could teach us,\u201d Gaskin chimed in.\nAlleg gave a mock snarl. \u201cDon\u2019t help him bargain, boy. I have the feeling this is going to be hard enough as it is.\u201d\nI gave it a little thought. \u201cI suppose I could stay. . . .\u201d I let myself trail off uncertainly.\nAlleg gave a knowing smile. \u201cBut ...\u201d\n\u201cBut I would ask for three things.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, three things.\u201d He looked me up and down. \u201cJust like in one of the\nstories.\u201d\n\u201cIt only seems right,\u201d I urged.\nHe gave a hesitant nod. \u201cI suppose it does. And how long would you travel\nwith us?\u201d", "\u201cUntil no one objects to my leaving.\u201d\n\u201cDoes anyone have any problem with this?\u201d Alleg looked around.\n\u201cWhat if he asks for one of the wagons?\u201d Tim asked. His voice startled me,\nharsh and rasping like two bricks grating together.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t matter, as he\u2019ll be traveling with us,\u201d Alleg argued. \u201cThey belong\nto all of us anyway. And since he can\u2019t leave unless we say so. . . .\u201d\nThere were no objections. Alleg and I shook hands and there was a small\ncheer.\nKete held up her mug. \u201cTo Kvothe and his songs!\u201d she said. \u201cI have a\nfeeling he\u2019ll be worth whatever he costs us.\u201d\nEveryone drank, and I held up my own glass. \u201cI swear on my mother\u2019s\nmilk, none of you will ever make a better deal than the one you made with me tonight.\u201d This evoked a more enthusiastic cheer and everyone drank again.\nWiping his mouth, Alleg looked me in the eye. \u201cSo, what is the first thing you want from us?\u201d\nI lowered my head. \u201cIt\u2019s a little thing really. I don\u2019t have a tent of my own. If I\u2019m going to be traveling with my family . . .\u201d\n\u201cSay no more!\u201d Alleg waved his wooden mug like a king granting a boon. \u201cYou\u2019ll have my own tent, piled with furs and blankets a foot deep!\u201d He made a gesture over the fire to where Fren and Josh sat. \u201cGo set it up for him.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d I protested. \u201cI can manage it myself.\u201d\n\u201cHush, it\u2019s good for them. Makes them feel useful. Speaking of which . . .\u201d He made another gesture at Tim. \u201cBring them out, would you?\u201d\nTim stood and pressed a hand to his stomach. \u201cI\u2019ll do it in a quick minute. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d He turned to walk off into the woods. \u201cI don\u2019t feel very good.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you get for eatin\u2019 like you\u2019re at a trough!\u201d Otto called after him. He turned back to the rest of us. \u201cSomeday he\u2019ll realize he can\u2019t eat more\u2019n me and not feel sick afterward.\u201d\n\u201cSince Tim\u2019s busy painting a tree, I\u2019ll go get them,\u201d Laren said with thinly veiled eagerness.\n\u201cI\u2019m on guard tonight,\u201d Otto said. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll get them,\u201d Kete said, exasperated. She stared the other two back into their seats and walked behind the wagon on my left.\nJosh and Fren came out of the other wagon with a tent, ropes, and stakes.", "\u201cWhere do you want it?\u201d Josh asked.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a question you usually have to ask a man, is it, Josh?\u201d Fren\njoked, nudging his friend with an elbow.\n\u201cI tend to snore,\u201d I warned them. \u201cYou\u2019ll probably want me a little away\nfrom everyone else.\u201d I pointed. \u201cOver between those two trees would be fine.\u201d\n\u201cI mean, with a man, you normally know where they want it, don\u2019t you, Josh?\u201d Fren continued as they wandered off and began to string up the tent.\nKete returned a minute later, leading a pair of lovely young girls. One had a lean body and face, with straight, black hair cut short like a boy\u2019s. The other was more generously rounded, with curling golden hair. Both wore hopeless expressions and looked to be about sixteen.\n\u201cMeet Krin and Ellie,\u201d Kete said, gesturing to the girls.\nAlleg smiled. \u201cThey are one of the ways in which Levinshir was generous to us. Tonight, one of them will be keeping you warm. My gift to you, as the new member in our family.\u201d He made a show of looking them over. \u201cWhich one would you like?\u201d\nI looked from one to the other. \u201cThat\u2019s a hard choice. Let me think on it a little while.\u201d\nKete sat them near the edge of the fire and put a bowl of stew in each of their hands. The girl with the golden hair, Ellie, ate woodenly for a few bites, then slowed to a stop like a toy winding down. Her eyes looked almost blind, as if she were watching something none of us could see. Krin\u2019s eyes, on the other hand, were focused fiercely into the fire. She sat stiffly with her bowl in her lap.\n\u201cGirls,\u201d Alleg chided. \u201cDon\u2019t you know that things will get better as soon as you start cooperating?\u201d Ellie took another slow bite, then stopped. Krin stared into the fire, her back stiff, her expression hard.\nFrom where she sat by the fire, Anne prodded at them with her wooden spoon. \u201cEat!\u201d The response was the same as before. One slow bite. One tense rebellion. Scowling, Anne leaned closer and gripped the dark-haired girl firmly by the chin, her other hand reaching for the bowl of stew.\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I urged. \u201cThey\u2019ll eat when they get hungry enough. \u201dAlleg looked up at me curiously. \u201cI know what I\u2019m talking about. Give them something to drink instead.\u201d\nThe old woman looked for a moment as if she might continue anyway, then shrugged and let go of Krin\u2019s jaw. \u201cFine. I\u2019m sick of force-feeding this", "one anyway. She\u2019s been nothing but trouble.\u201d\nKete sniffed in agreement. \u201cLittle bitch came at me when I untied her for\nher bath,\u201d she said, brushing her hair away from the side of her face to reveal scratch marks. \u201cAlmost took out my damn eye.\u201d\n\u201cDid a runner, too,\u201d Anne said, still scowling. \u201cI\u2019ve had to start doping her at night.\u201d She made a disgusted gesture. \u201cLet her starve if she wants.\u201d\nLaren came back to the fire with two mugs, setting them in the girl\u2019s unresisting hands.\n\u201cWater?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cAle,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be better for them if they aren\u2019t eating.\u201d\nI stifled my protest. Ellie drank in the same vacant manner in which she\nhad eaten. Krin moved her eyes from the fire, to the cup, to me. I felt an almost physical shock at her resemblance to Denna. Still looking at me, she drank. Her hard eyes gave away nothing of what was happening inside her head.\n\u201cBring them over to sit by me,\u201d I said. \u201cIt might help me to make up my mind.\u201d\nKete brought them over. Ellie was docile. Krin was stiff.\n\u201cBe careful with this one,\u201d Kete said, nodding to the dark-haired girl. \u201cShe\u2019s a scratcher.\u201d\nTim came back looking a little pale. He sat by the fire where Otto nudged him with an elbow. \u201cWant some more stew?\u201d he asked maliciously.\n\u201cSod off,\u201dTim rasped weakly.\n\u201cA little ale might settle your stomach,\u201d I advised.\nHe nodded, seeming eager for anything that might help him. Kete fetched\nhim a fresh mugful.\nBy this time the girls were sitting on either side of me, facing the fire.\nCloser, I saw things I had missed before. There was a dark bruise on the back of Krin\u2019s neck. The blonde girl\u2019s wrists were merely chafed from being tied, but Krin\u2019s were raw and scabbed. For all that, they smelled clean. Their hair was brushed and their clothes had been washed recently. Kete had been tending to them.\nThey were also much more lovely up close. I reached out to touch their shoulders. Krin flinched, then stiffened. Ellie didn\u2019t react at all.\nFrom off in the direction of the trees Fren called out, \u201cIt\u2019s done. Do you want us to light a lamp for you?\u201d\n\u201cYes, please,\u201d I called back. I looked from one girl to the other and then to", "Alleg. \u201cI cannot decide between the two,\u201d I told him honestly. \u201cSo I will have both.\u201d\nAlleg laughed incredulously. Then, seeing I was serious, he protested, \u201cOh come now. That\u2019s hardly fair to the rest of us. Besides, you can\u2019t possibly. . . .\u201d\nI gave him a frank look.\n\u201cWell,\u201d he hedged, \u201cEven if you can, it . . .\u201d\n\u201cThis is the second thing I ask for,\u201d I said formally. \u201cBoth of them.\u201d Otto made a cry of protest that was echoed in the expressions of Gaskin\nand Laren.\nI smiled reassuringly at them. \u201cOnly for tonight.\u201d\nFren and Josh came back from setting up my tent. \u201cBe thankful he didn\u2019t\nask for you, Otto,\u201d Fren said to the big man. \u201cThat\u2019s what Josh would have asked for, isn\u2019t it Josh?\u201d\n\u201cShut your hole, Fren,\u201d Otto said, exasperated. \u201cNow I feel ill.\u201d\nI stood and slung my lute over one shoulder. Then I led both lovely girls, one golden and one dark, toward my tent.", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-ONE": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-ONE\nBlack by Moonlight\nFREN AND JOSH HAD done a good job with the tent. It was tall enough to stand in the center, but still crowded with me and both girls standing. I gave the golden-haired one, Ellie, a gentle push toward the bed of thick blankets. \u201cSit down,\u201d I said gently.\nWhen she didn\u2019t respond, I took her by the shoulders and eased her into a sitting position. She let herself be moved, but her blue eyes were wide and vacant. I checked her head for any signs of a wound. Not finding any, I guessed she was in deep shock.\nI took a moment and dug through my travel sack, then shook some powdered leaf into my traveling cup and added some water from my waterskin. I set the cup into Ellie\u2019s hands, and she took hold of it absently. \u201cDrink it,\u201d I encouraged, trying to capture the tone of voice Felurian had used to gain my thoughtless compliance from time to time.\nIt may have worked, or perhaps she was just thirsty. Whatever the reason, Ellie drained the cup to the bottom. Her eyes still held the same faraway look they had before.\nI shook another measure of the powdered leaf into the cup, refilled it with water, and held it out for the dark-haired girl to drink.\nWe stayed there for several minutes, my arm outstretched, her arms motionless at her sides. Finally she blinked, her eyes focusing on me. \u201cWhat did you give her?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cCrushed velia,\u201d I said gently. \u201cIt\u2019s a countertoxin. There was poison in the stew.\u201d\nHer eyes told me she didn\u2019t believe me. \u201cI didn\u2019t eat any of the stew.\u201d\n\u201cIt was in the ale too. I saw you drink that.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to die.\u201d\nI gave a deep sigh. \u201cIt won\u2019t kill you. It\u2019ll just make you miserable. You\u2019ll\nthrow up and be weak with muscle cramps for a day or two.\u201d I raised the cup, offering it to her.", "\u201cWhy do you care if they kill me?\u201d she asked tonelessly. \u201cIf they don\u2019t do it now they\u2019ll do it later. I\u2019d rather die. . . .\u201d She clenched her teeth before she finished the sentence.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t poison you. I poisoned them and you happened to get some of it. I\u2019m sorry, but this will help you over the worst of it.\u201d\nKrin\u2019s gaze wavered for a second, then became iron hard again. She looked at the cup, then fixed her gaze on me. \u201cIf it\u2019s harmless, you drink it.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I explained. \u201cIt would put me to sleep, and I have things to do tonight.\u201d\nKrin\u2019s eyes darted to the bed of furs laid out on the floor of the tent.\nI smiled my gentlest, saddest smile. \u201cNot those sorts of things.\u201d\nShe still didn\u2019t move. We stood there for a long while. I heard a muted\nretching sound from off in the woods. I sighed and lowered the cup. Looking down, I saw Ellie had already curled up and gone to sleep. Her face looked almost peaceful.\nI took a deep breath and looked back up at Krin. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any reason to trust me,\u201d I said, looking straight into her eyes. \u201cNot after what has happened to you. But I hope you will.\u201d I held out the cup again.\nShe met my eyes without blinking, then reached for the cup. She drank it off in one swallow, choked a little, and sat down. Her eyes stayed hard as marble as she stared at the wall of the tent. I sat down, slightly apart from her.\nIn fifteen minutes she was asleep. I covered the two of them with a blanket and watched their faces. In sleep they were even more beautiful than before. I reached out to brush a strand of hair from Krin\u2019s cheek. To my surprise, she opened her eyes and stared at me. Not the marble stare she had given me before, she looked at me with the dark eyes of a young Denna.\nI froze with my hand on her cheek. We watched each other for a second. Then her eyes drew closed again. I couldn\u2019t tell if it was the drug pulling her under, or her own will surrendering to sleep.\nI settled myself at the entrance of the tent and lay Caesura across my knees. I felt rage like a fire inside me, and the sight of the two sleeping girls was like a wind fanning the coals. I set my teeth and forced myself to think of what had happened here, letting the fire burn fiercely, letting the heat of it fill me. I drew deep breaths, tempering myself for what was to come.\n \nI waited for three hours, listening to the sounds of the camp. Muted conversation drifted toward me, shapes of sentences with no individual words. They faded, mixing with cursing and sounds of people being ill. I took long, slow breaths as Vashet had shown me, relaxing my body, slowly counting my exhalations.\nThen, opening my eyes, I looked at the stars and judged the time to be right. I slowly unfolded myself from my sitting position and made a long, slow stretch. There was a solid crescent of moon hanging in the sky, and everything seemed very bright.\nI approached the campfire slowly. It had fallen to sullen coals that did little to light the space between the two wagons. Otto was there, his huge body slumped against one of the wheels. I smelled vomit. \u201cIs that you, Kvothe?\u201d he asked blurrily.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I continued my slow walk toward him.\n\u201cThat bitch Anne didn\u2019t let the lamb cook through,\u201d he moaned. \u201cI swear to holy God I\u2019ve never been this sick before.\u201d He looked up at me. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d\nCaesura leapt, caught the moonlight briefly on her blade, and tore his throat. He staggered to one knee, then toppled to his side, his hands staining black as they clutched his neck. I left him bleeding darkly in the moonlight, unable to cry out, dying but not dead.\nI tossed a piece of brittle iron into the coals of the fire and headed toward the other tents.\nLaren startled me as I came around the wagon. He made a surprised noise as he saw me walk around the corner with my naked sword. But the poison had made him sluggish, and he had barely managed to raise his hands before Caesura took him in the chest. He choked a scream as he fell backward, writhing on the ground.\nNone of them had been sleeping soundly due to the poison, so Laren\u2019s cry set them pouring from the wagons and tents, staggering and looking around wildly. Two indistinct shapes that I knew must be Josh and Fren leapt from the open back of the wagon closest to me. I struck one in the eye before he hit the ground and tore the belly from the other.\nEveryone saw, and now there were screams in earnest. Most of them began to run drunkenly into the trees, some falling as they went. But the tall shape of Tim hurled itself at me. The heavy sword he had been sharpening all", "evening glinted silver in the moonlight.\nBut I was ready. I slid a second long, brittle piece of sword-iron into my\nhand and muttered a binding. Then, just as he came close enough to strike I snapped the iron sharply between my fingers. His sword shattered with the sound of a broken bell, and the pieces tumbled and disappeared in the dark grass.\nTim was more experienced than me, stronger, and with longer reach. Even poisoned and with half a sword he made a good showing of himself. It took me nearly half a minute before I snuck past his guard with Lover Out the Window and severed his hand at the wrist.\nHe fell to his knees, letting out a raspy howl and clutching at the stump. I struck him high in the chest and headed for the trees. The fight hadn\u2019t taken long, but every second was vital, as the others were already scattering into the woods.\nI hurried in the direction I\u2019d seen one of the dark shapes stagger. I was careless, so when Alleg threw himself on me from the shadow of a tree he caught me unaware. He didn\u2019t have a sword, only a small knife flashing in the moonlight as he dove for me. But a knife is enough to kill a man. He stabbed me in the stomach as we rolled to the ground. I struck the side of my head against a root and tasted blood.\nI fought my way to my feet before he did and cut the hamstring on his leg. Then I stabbed him in the stomach and left him cursing on the ground as I went to hunt the others. I held one hand tight across my stomach. I knew the pain would hit me soon, and after that I might not have long to live.\nIt was a long night, and I will not trouble you with any further details. I found all the rest of them as they made their way through the forest. Anne had broken her leg in her reckless flight, and Tim made it nearly half a mile despite the loss of his hand and the wound in his chest. They shouted and cursed and begged for mercy as I stalked them through the forest, but nothing they said could appease me.\nIt was a terrible night, but I found them all. There was no honor to it, no glory. But there was justice of a sort, and blood, and in the end I brought their bodies back.\n \n I came back to my tent as the sky was beginning to color to a familiar blue. A sharp, hot line of pain burned a few inches below my navel, and I could tell from the unpleasant tugging when I moved that dried blood had matted my shirt to the wound. I ignored the feeling as best I could, knowing I could do nothing for myself with my hands shaking and no decent light to see by. I\u2019d have to wait for dawn to see how badly I was hurt.\nI tried not to dwell on what I knew from my work in the Medica. Any deep wound to the gut promises a long, painful trip to the grave. A skilled physicker with the right equipment could make a difference, but I couldn\u2019t be farther from civilization. I might as well wish for a piece of the moon.\nI wiped my sword, sat in the wet grass in front of the tent, and began to think.", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-TWO": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-TWO\nThe Broken Circle\nI HAD BEEN BUSY FOR more than an hour when the sun finally peered over the tops of the trees and began to burn the dew from the grass. I had found a flat rock and was using it as a makeshift anvil to hammer a spare horseshoe into a different shape. Above the fire a pot of oats was boiling.\nI was just putting the finishing touches on the horseshoe when I saw a flicker of movement from the corner of my eye. It was Krin peeking around the corner of the wagon. I guessed I\u2019d woken her with the sound of hammering iron.\n\u201cOh my God.\u201d Her hand went to her mouth and she took a couple stunned steps out from behind the wagon. \u201cYou killed them.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said simply, my voice sounding dead in my ears.\nKrin\u2019s eyes ran up and down my body, staring at my torn and bloody shirt. \u201cAre . . .\u201d Her voice caught in her throat, and she swallowed. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d\nI nodded silently. When I\u2019d finally worked up the courage to examine my wound, I\u2019d discovered that Felurian\u2019s cloak had saved my life. Instead of spilling open my guts, Alleg\u2019s knife had merely given me a long, shallow cut across my belly. He had also ruined a perfectly good shirt, but I had a hard time feeling bad about that, all things considered.\nI examined the horseshoe, then used a damp leather strap to tie it firmly to one end of a long, straight branch. I pulled the kettle of oats off the fire and thrust the horseshoe into the coals.\nSeeming to recover from some of her shock, Krin slowly approached, eyeing the row of bodies on the other side of the fire. I had done nothing other than lay them out in a rough line. It wasn\u2019t tidy. Blood stained the bodies, and their wounds gaped openly. Krin stared as if she were afraid they might start to move again.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked finally.\nIn answer, I pulled the now-hot horseshoe from the coals of the fire and", "approached the nearest body. It was Tim. I pressed the hot iron against the back of his remaining hand. The skin smoked and hissed and stuck to the metal. After a moment I pulled it away, leaving a black burn against his white skin. A broken circle. I moved back to the fire and began to heat the iron again.\nKrin stood mutely, too stunned to react normally. Not that there could be a normal way to react in a situation like this, I suppose. But she didn\u2019t scream or run off as I thought she might. She simply looked at the broken circle and repeated, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\nWhen I finally spoke, my voice sounded strange to my own ears. \u201cAll of the Edema Ruh are one family,\u201d I explained. \u201cLike a closed circle. It doesn\u2019t matter if some of us are strangers to others, we are still family, still close. We have to be this way, because we are always strangers wherever we go. We are scattered, and people hate us.\n\u201cWe have laws. Rules we follow. When one of us does a thing that cannot be forgiven or mended, if he jeopardizes the safety or the honor of the Edema Ruh, he is killed and branded with the broken circle to show he is no longer one of us. It is rarely done. There is rarely a need.\u201d\nI pulled the iron from the fire and walked to the next body. Otto. I pressed it to the back of his hand and listened to it hiss. \u201cThese were not Edema Ruh. But they made themselves out to be. They did things no Edema would do, so I am making sure the world knows they were not part of our family. The Ruh do not do the sort of things that these men did.\u201d\n\u201cBut the wagons,\u201d she protested. \u201cThe instruments.\u201d\n\u201cThey were not Edema Ruh,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cThey probably weren\u2019t even real troupers, just a group of thieves who killed a band of Ruh and tried to take their place.\u201d\nKrin stared at the bodies, then back at me. \u201cSo you killed them for pretending to be Edema Ruh?\u201d\n\u201cFor pretending to be Ruh? No.\u201d I put the iron back in the fire. \u201cFor killing a Ruh troupe and stealing their wagons? Yes. For what they did to you? Yes.\u201d\n\u201cBut if they aren\u2019t Ruh . . .\u201d Krin looked at the brightly painted wagons. \u201cHow?\u201d\n\u201cI am curious about that myself,\u201d I said. Pulling the broken circle from the fire again, I moved to Alleg and pressed it onto his palm.\nThe false trouper jerked and screamed himself awake. \u201cHe isn\u2019t dead!\u201d Krin exclaimed shrilly.", "I had examined the wound earlier. \u201cHe\u2019s dead,\u201d I said coldly. \u201cHe just hasn\u2019t stopped moving yet.\u201d I turned to look him in the eye. \u201cHow about it, Alleg? How did you come by a pair of Edema wagons?\u201d\n\u201cRuh bastard,\u201d he cursed at me with blurry defiance.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, \u201cI am. And you are not. So how did you learn my family\u2019s signs and customs?\u201d\n\u201cHow did you know?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe knew the words, the handshake. We knew water and wine and songs before supper. How did you know?\u201d\n\u201cYou thought you could fool me?\u201d I said, feeling my anger coiling inside me again like a spring. \u201cThis is my family! How could I not know? Ruh don\u2019t do what you did. Ruh don\u2019t steal, don\u2019t kidnap girls.\u201d\nAlleg shook his head with a mocking smile. There was blood on his teeth. \u201cEveryone knows what you people do.\u201d\nMy temper exploded. \u201cEveryone thinks they know! They think rumor is the truth! Ruh don\u2019t do this!\u201d I gestured wildly around me. \u201cPeople only think those things because of people like you!\u201d My anger flared even hotter and I found myself screaming. \u201cNow tell me what I want to know or God will weep when he hears what I\u2019ve done to you!\u201d\nAlleg paled and had to swallow before he found his voice. \u201cThere was an old man and his wife and a couple other players. I traveled guard with them for half a year. Eventually they took me in.\u201d He ran out of breath and gasped a bit as he tried to get it back.\nHe\u2019d said enough. \u201cSo you killed them.\u201d\nAlleg shook his head vigorously. \u201cNo . . . were attacked on the road.\u201d He gestured weakly to the other bodies. \u201cThey surprised us. The other players were killed, but I was just . . . knocked out.\u201d\nI looked over the line of bodies and felt the rage flare up, even though I\u2019d already known. There was no other way these people could have come by a pair of Edema wagons with their markings intact.\nAlleg was talking again. \u201cI showed them afterward ... How to act like a troupe.\u201d He swallowed against the pain. \u201cGood life.\u201d\nI turned away, disgusted. He was one of us, in a way. One of our adopted family. It made everything ten times worse knowing that. I pushed the horseshoe into the coals of the fire again, then looked to the girl as it heated. Her eyes had gone to flint as she watched Alleg.\nNot sure if it was the right thing to do, I offered her the brand. Her face went hard and she took it.", "Alleg didn\u2019t seem to understand what was about to happen until she had the hot iron against his chest. He shrieked and twisted but lacked the strength to get away as she pressed it hard against him. She grimaced as he struggled weakly against the iron, her eyes brimming with angry tears.\nAfter a long minute she pulled the iron away and stood, crying quietly. I let her be.\nAlleg looked up at her and somehow managed to find his voice. \u201cAh girl, we had some good times, didn\u2019t we?\u201d She stopped crying and looked at him. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2014\u201d\nI kicked him sharply in the side before he could say anything else. He stiffened in mute pain and then spat blood at me. I landed another kick, and he went limp.\nNot knowing what else to do, I took back the brand and began heating it again.\nThere was a long silence. \u201cIs Ellie still asleep?\u201d I asked.\nKrin nodded.\n\u201cDo you think it would help for her to see this?\u201d\nShe thought about it, wiping at her face with a hand. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she\nsaid finally. \u201cI don\u2019t think she could see it right now. She\u2019s not right in her head.\u201d\n\u201cThe two of you are from Levinshir?\u201d I asked to keep the silence at arm\u2019s length.\n\u201cMy family farms just north of Levinshir,\u201d Krin said. \u201cEllie\u2019s father is mayor.\u201d\n\u201cWhen did these come into your town?\u201d I asked as I set the brand to the back of another hand. The sweet smell of charred flesh was becoming thick in the air.\n\u201cWhat day is it?\u201d\nI counted in my head. \u201cFelling.\u201d\n\u201cThey came into town on Theden.\u201d She paused. \u201cFive days ago?\u201d Her\nvoice was tinged with disbelief. \u201cWe were glad to have the chance to see a play and hear the news. Hear some music.\u201d She looked down. \u201cThey were camped on the east edge of town. When I came to get my fortune read they told me to come back that night. They seemed so friendly, so exciting.\u201d\nKrin looked at the wagons. \u201cWhen I showed up, they were all sitting around the fire. They sang me songs. The old woman gave me some tea. I didn\u2019t even think . . . I mean . . . she looked like my gran.\u201d Her eyes strayed", "to the body of the old woman, then away. \u201cThen I don\u2019t remember what happened. I woke up in the dark, in one of the wagons. I was tied up and I . . .\u201d Her voice broke a little, and she rubbed absentmindedly at her wrists. She glanced back at the tent. \u201cI guess Ellie got an invitation too.\u201d\nI finished branding the backs of their hands. I had been planning to do their faces too, but the iron was slow to heat in the fire, and I was quickly growing sick of the work. I hadn\u2019t slept at all, and the anger that had burned so hot for so long was in its final flicker, leaving me feeling cold and numb.\nI made a gesture to the pot of oats I\u2019d pulled off the fire. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, then darted a look toward the bodies. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cMe neither. Go wake up Ellie and we can get you home.\u201d\nKrin hurried off to the tent. After she disappeared inside, I turned to the\nline of bodies. \u201cDoes anyone object to my leaving the troupe?\u201d I asked. None of them did. So I left.", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-THREE": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-THREE\nDreams\nIT WAS AN HOUR\u2019S work to drive the wagons into a thick piece of forest and hide them. I destroyed their Edema markings and unhitched the horses. There was only one saddle, so I loaded the other two horses with food and whatever other portable valuables I could find.\nWhen I returned with the horses, Krin and Ellie were waiting for me. More precisely, Krin was waiting. Ellie was merely standing nearby, her expression vacant, her eyes empty.\n\u201cDo you know how to ride?\u201d I asked Krin.\nShe nodded and I handed her the reins to the saddled horse. She got one foot in the stirrup and stopped, shaking her head. She brought her foot back down slowly. \u201cI\u2019ll walk.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think Ellie would stay on a horse?\u201d\nKrin looked over to where the blonde girl was standing. One of the horses nuzzled her curiously and got no response. \u201cProbably. But I don\u2019t think it would be good for her. After . . .\u201d\nI nodded in understanding. \u201cWe\u2019ll all walk then.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is the heart of the Lethani?\u201d I asked Vashet.\n\u201cSuccess and right action.\u201d\n\u201cWhich is the more important, success or rightness?\u201d\n\u201cThey are the same. If you act rightly success follows.\u201d\n\u201cBut others may succeed by doing wrong things,\u201d I pointed out.\n\u201cWrong things never lead to success,\u201d Vashet said firmly. \u201cIf a man acts\nwrongly and succeeds, that is not the way. Without the Lethani there is no true success.\u201d\nSir? A voice called. \u201cSir?\u201d\n \nMy eyes focused on Krin. Her hair was windblown, her young face tired. She looked at me timidly. \u201cSir? It\u2019s getting dark.\u201d\nI looked around and saw twilight creeping in from the east. I was bone weary and had fallen into a walking doze after we had stopped for lunch at midday.\n\u201cJust call me Kvothe, Krin. Thanks for jogging my elbow. My mind was somewhere else.\u201d\nKrin gathered wood and started a fire. I unsaddled the horses, then fed and rubbed them down. I took a few minutes to set up the tent, too. Normally I don\u2019t bother with such things, but there had been room for it on the horses, and I guessed the girls weren\u2019t used to sleeping out of doors.\nAfter I finished with the tent, I realized I\u2019d only brought one extra blanket from the troupe\u2019s supplies. There would be a chill tonight too, if I was any judge of such things.\n\u201cDinner\u2019s ready,\u201d I heard Krin call. I tossed my blanket and the spare one into the tent and headed back to where she was finishing up. She\u2019d done a good job with what was available. Potato soup with bacon and toasted bread. There was a green summer squash nestled into the coals as well.\nEllie worried me. She had been the same all day, walking listlessly, never speaking or responding to anything Krin or I said to her. Her eyes would follow things, but there was no thought behind them. Krin and I had discovered the hard way that if left to herself she would stop walking, or wander off the road if something caught her eye.\nKrin handed me a bowl and spoon as I sat down. \u201cIt smells good.\u201d I complimented her.\nShe half-smiled and dished a second bowl for herself. She started to fill a third bowl, then hesitated, realizing Ellie couldn\u2019t feed herself.\n\u201cWould you like some soup, Ellie?\u201d I asked in normal tones. \u201cIt smells good.\u201d\nShe sat blankly by the fire, staring into nothing.\n\u201cDo you want to share mine?\u201d I asked as if it were the most natural thing in the world. I moved closer to her and blew on a spoonful to cool it. \u201cHere you go.\u201d\nEllie ate it mechanically, turning her head slightly in my direction, toward the spoon. Her eyes reflected the dancing patterns of the fire. They were like the windows of an empty house.\nI blew on another spoonful and held it out to the blonde girl. She opened", "her mouth only when the spoon touched her lips. I moved my head, trying to see past the dancing firelight in her eyes, desperately hoping to see something behind them. Anything.\n\u201cI bet you\u2019re an Ell, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I said conversationally. I looked at Krin. \u201cShort for Ellie?\u201d\nKrin shrugged helplessly. \u201cWe weren\u2019t friends, really. She\u2019s just Ellie Anwater. The mayor\u2019s daughter.\u201d\n\u201cIt sure was a long walk today,\u201d I continued speaking in the same easy tone. \u201cHow do your feet feel, Krin?\u201d\nKrin continued to watch me with her serious dark eyes. \u201cA little sore.\u201d \u201cMine too. I can\u2019t wait to get my shoes off. Are your feet sore, Ell?\u201d No response. I fed her another bite.\n\u201cIt was pretty hot too. It should cool off tonight, though. Good sleeping\nweather. Won\u2019t that be nice, Ell?\u201d\nNo response. Krin continued to watch me from the other side of the fire. I\ntook a bite of soup for myself. \u201cThis is truly fine, Krin,\u201d I said earnestly, then turned back to the vacant girl. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing we have Krin to cook for us, Ell. Everything I cook tastes like horseshit.\u201d\nOn her side of the fire, Krin tried to laugh with a mouthful of soup with predictable results. I thought I saw a flicker in Ell\u2019s eyes. \u201cIf I had some horse apples I could make us a horse apple pie for dessert,\u201d I offered. \u201cI could make some tonight if you want . . .\u201d I trailed off, making it a question.\nEll gave the slightest frown, a small wrinkle creased her forehead.\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably right,\u201d I said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be very good. Would you like more soup instead?\u201d\nThe barest nod. I gave her a spoonful.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little salty, though. You probably want some water.\u201d\nAnother nod. I handed her the waterskin and she lifted it to her own lips.\nShe drank for a long, long minute. She was probably parched from our long walk today. I would have to watch her more closely tomorrow to make sure she drank enough.\n\u201cWould you like a drink, Krin?\u201d\n\u201cYes please,\u201d Krin said, her eyes fixed on Ell\u2019s face.\nMoving automatically, Ell held the waterskin out toward Krin, holding it\ndirectly over the fire with the shoulder strap dragging in the coals. Krin grabbed it quickly, then added a belated, \u201cThank you, Ell.\u201d\nI kept the slow stream of conversation going through the whole meal. Ell", "fed herself toward the end of it, and though her eyes were clearer, it was as if she were looking at the world through a sheet of frosted glass, seeing but not seeing. Still, it was an improvement.\nAfter she ate two bowls of soup and half a loaf of bread, her eyes began to bob closed. \u201cWould you like to go to sleep, Ell?\u201d I asked.\nA more definite nod.\n\u201cShould I carry you to the tent?\u201d\nHer eyes snapped open at this and she shook her head firmly.\n\u201cMaybe Krin would help you get ready for bed if you asked her.\u201d\nEll turned to look in Krin\u2019s direction. Her mouth moved in a vague way.\nKrin darted a glance at me and I nodded.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go and get tucked in then,\u201d Krin said, sounding every bit the older\nsister. She came over and took Ell\u2019s hand, helping her to her feet. As they went into the tent, I finished off the soup and ate a piece of bread that had been too badly burnt for either of the girls.\nBefore too long Krin came back to the fire. \u201cIs she sleeping?\u201d I asked. \u201cBefore she hit the pillow. Do you think she will be all right?\u201d\nShe was in deep shock. Her mind had stepped through the doors of\nmadness to protect itself from what was happening. \u201cIt\u2019s probably just a matter of time,\u201d I said tiredly, hoping it was the truth. \u201cThe young heal quickly.\u201d I chuckled humorlessly as I realized she was probably only about a year younger than me. I felt every year twice tonight, some of them three times.\nDespite the fact that I felt covered in lead, I forced myself to my feet and helped Krin clean the dishes. I sensed her growing unease as we finished cleaning up and repicketing the horses to a fresh piece of grazing. The tension grew worse as we approached the tent. I stopped and held the flap open for her. \u201cI\u2019ll sleep out here tonight.\u201d\nHer relief was tangible. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\nI nodded. She slipped inside, and I let the flap fall closed behind her. Her head poked back out almost immediately, followed by a hand holding a blanket.\nI shook my head. \u201cYou\u2019ll need them both. There\u2019ll be a chill tonight.\u201d I pulled my shaed around me and lay directly in front of the tent. I didn\u2019t want Ell wandering out during the night and getting lost or hurt.\n\u201cWon\u2019t you be cold?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I said. I was tired enough to sleep on a running horse. I was", "tired enough to sleep under a running horse.\nKrin ducked her head back into the tent. Soon I heard her nestling into the\nblankets. Then everything was quiet.\nI remembered the startled look on Otto\u2019s face as I cut his throat. I heard\nAlleg struggle weakly and curse me as I dragged him back to the wagons. I remembered the blood. The way it had felt against my hands. The thickness of it.\nI had never killed anyone like that before. Not coldly, not close up. I remembered how warm their blood had been. I remembered the way Kete had cried as I stalked her through the woods. \u201cIt was them or me!\u201d she had screamed hysterically. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a choice. It was them or me!\u201d\nI lay awake a long while. When I finally slept, the dreams were worse.", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-FOUR": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-FOUR\nThe Road to Levinshir\nWE MADE POOR TIME the next day, as Krin and I were forced to lead the three horses and Ell besides. Luckily, the horses were well-behaved, as Edema-trained horses tend to be. If they had been as wayward-witted as the poor mayor\u2019s daughter, we might never have made it to Levinshir at all.\nEven so, the horses were almost more trouble than they were worth. The glossy roan in particular liked to wander off into the underbrush, foraging. Three times now I\u2019d had to drag him out, and we were irritated with each other. I\u2019d named him Burrback for obvious reasons.\nThe fourth time I had to pull him back onto the road, I seriously considered cutting him loose to save myself the trouble. I didn\u2019t, of course. A good horse is the same as money in your pocket. And it would be quicker to ride back to Severen than walk the whole way.\nKrin and I did our best to keep Ell engaged in conversation as we walked. It seemed to help a bit. And by the time our noon meal came around she seemed almost aware of what was going on around her. Almost.\nI had an idea as we were getting ready to set out again after lunch. I led our dappled grey mare over to where Ell stood. Her golden hair was one great tangle and she was trying to run one of her hands through it while her eyes wandered around in a distracted way, as if she didn\u2019t quite understand where she was.\n\u201cEll.\u201d She turned to look. \u201cHave you met Greytail?\u201d I gestured to the mare. A faint, confused shake of the head.\n\u201cI need your help leading her. Have you led a horse before?\u201d\nA nod.\n\u201cShe needs someone to take care of her. Can you do it?\u201d Greytail looked at me with one large eye, as if to let me know she needed leading as much as I needed wheels to walk. But then she lowered her head a bit and nuzzled Ell in a motherly way. The girl reached out a hand to pet her nose almost automatically, then took the reins from me.", "\u201cDo you think that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d Krin asked when I came back to pack the other horses.\n\u201cGreytail is gentle as a lamb.\u201d\n\u201cJust because Ell is witless as a sheep,\u201d Krin said archly, \u201cdoesn\u2019t make them a good pairing.\u201d\nI cracked a smile at that. \u201cWe\u2019ll watch them close for an hour or so. If it doesn\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t. But sometimes the best help a person can find is helping someone else.\u201d\nSince I had slept poorly I was twice weary today. My stomach was sour, and I felt gritty, like someone had sanded the first two layers of my skin away. I was almost tempted to doze in the saddle, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to ride while the girls walked.\nSo I plodded along, leading my horse and nodding on my feet. But today I couldn\u2019t fall into the comfortable half-sleep I tend to use when walking. I was plagued with thoughts of Alleg, wondering if he was still alive.\nI knew from my time in the Medica that the gut wound I\u2019d given him was fatal. I also knew it was a slow death. Slow and painful. With proper care it might be a full span of days before he died. Even alone in the middle of nowhere he could live for days with such a wound.\nNot pleasant days. He would grow delirious with fever as the infection set in. Every movement would tear the wound open again. He couldn\u2019t walk on his hamstrung leg, either. So if he wanted to move he\u2019d have to crawl. He would be cramped with hunger and burning with thirst by now.\nBut not dead from thirst. No. I had left a full waterskin nearby. I had laid it at his side before we had left. Not out of kindness. Not to make his last hours more bearable. I had left it because I knew that with water he would live longer, suffer more.\nLeaving him that waterskin was the most terrible thing I\u2019d ever done, and now that my anger had cooled to ashes I regretted it. I wondered how much longer he would live because of it. A day? Two? Certainly no more than two. I tried not to think of what those two days would be like.\nBut even when I forced thoughts of Alleg from my mind, I had other demons to fight. I remembered bits and pieces of that night, the things the\n \nfalse troupers had said as I cut them down. The sounds my sword had made as it dug into them. The smell of their skin as I had branded them. I had killed two women. What would Vashet think of my actions? What would anyone think?\nExhausted from worry and lack of sleep, my thoughts spun in these circles for the remainder of the day. I set up camp from force of habit and kept up a conversation with Ell through an effort of sheer will. The time for sleep came before I was ready, and I found myself rolled in my shaed, in the front of the girls\u2019 tent. I was dimly aware that Krin had started giving me the same worried look she\u2019d been giving Ell for the past two days.\nI lay wide-eyed for an hour before falling asleep, wondering about Alleg.\nWhen I slept I dreamed of killing them. In my dream I stalked the forest like grim death, unwavering.\nBut it was different this time. I killed Otto, his blood spattering my hands like hot grease. Then I killed Laren and Josh and Tim. They moaned and screamed, twisting on the ground. Their wounds were horrible, but I could not look away.\nThen the faces changed. I was killing Taren, the bearded ex-mercenary in my troupe. Then I killed Trip. Then I was chasing Shandi through the forest, my sword naked in my hand. She was crying out, weeping in fear. When I finally caught her she clutched at me, knocking me to the ground, burying her face in my chest, sobbing. \u201cNo no no,\u201d she begged. \u201cNo no no.\u201d\nI came awake. I lay on my back, terrified and not knowing where my dream ended and the world began. After a brief moment I realized the truth. Ell had crawled from the tent and lay curled against me. Her face pressed against my chest, her hand grasping desperately at my arm.\n\u201cNo no,\u201d she choked out. \u201cNo no no no no.\u201d Her body shook with helpless sobs when she couldn\u2019t say it anymore. My shirt was wet with hot tears. My arm was bleeding where she clutched it.\nI made consoling noises and brushed at her hair with my hand. After a long while she quieted and eventually fell into an exhausted sleep, still clinging tightly to my chest.\nI lay very still, not wanting to wake her by moving. My teeth were clenched. I thought of Alleg and Otto and all the rest. I remembered the blood and screaming and the smell of burning skin. I remembered it all and dreamed of worse things I could have done to them.\nI never had the nightmares again. Sometimes I think of Alleg and I smile.", " We made it to Levinshir the next day. Ell had come to her senses, but remained quiet and withdrawn. Still, things went more quickly now, especially as the girls decided they had recovered enough to take turns riding Greytail.\nWe covered six miles before we stopped at midday, with the girls becoming increasingly excited as they began to recognize parts of the countryside. The shape of hills in the distance. A crooked tree by the road.\nBut as we grew closer to Levinshir they grew quiet.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just over the rise there,\u201d Krin said, getting down off the roan. \u201cYou ride from here, Ell.\u201d\nEll looked from her, to me, to her feet. She shook her head.\nI watched them. \u201cAre the two of you okay?\u201d\n\u201cMy father\u2019s going to kill me.\u201d Krin\u2019s voice was barely a whisper, her face\nfull of serious fear.\n\u201cYour father will be one of the happiest men in the world tonight,\u201d I said,\nthen thought it best to be honest. \u201cHe might be angry too. But that\u2019s only because he\u2019s been scared out of his mind for the last eight days.\u201d\nKrin seemed slightly reassured, but Ell burst out crying. Krin put her arms around her, making gentle sounds.\n\u201cNo one will marry me,\u201d Ell sobbed. \u201cI was going to marry Jason Waterson and help him run his store. He won\u2019t marry me now. No one will.\u201d\nI looked up to Krin and saw the same fear reflected in her wet eyes. But Krin\u2019s eyes were angry while Ell\u2019s held nothing but despair.\n\u201cAny man who thinks that way is a fool,\u201d I said, weighting my voice with all the conviction I could bring to bear. \u201cAnd the two of you are too clever and too beautiful to be marrying fools.\u201d\nIt seemed to calm Ell somewhat, her eyes turning up at me as if looking for something to believe.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the truth,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd none of this was your fault. Make sure you remember that for these next couple days.\u201d\n\u201cI hate them!\u201d Ell spat, surprising me with her sudden rage. \u201cI hate men!\u201d Her knuckles were white as she gripped Greytail\u2019s reins. Her face twisted into a mask of anger. Krin put her arms around Ell, but when she looked at me I saw the sentiment reflected quietly in her dark eyes.\n\u201cYou have every right to hate them,\u201d I said, feeling more anger and", "helplessness than ever before in my life. \u201cBut I\u2019m a man too. Not all of us are like that.\u201d\nWe stayed there for a while, not more than a half-mile from town. We had a drink of water and a small bite to settle our nerves. And then I took them home.", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-FIVE": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-FIVE\nHomecoming\nLEVINSHIR WASN\u2019T A BIG town. Two hundred people lived there, maybe three if you counted the outlying farms. It was mealtime when we rode in, and the dirt road that split the town in half was empty and quiet. Ell told me her house was on the far side of town. I hoped to get the girls there without being seen. They were worn down and distraught. The last thing they needed was to face a mob of gossipy neighbors.\nBut it wasn\u2019t meant to be. We were halfway through the town when I saw a flicker of movement in a window. A woman\u2019s voice cried out, \u201cEll!\u201d and in ten seconds people began to spill from every doorway in sight.\nThe women were the quickest, and inside a minute a dozen of them had formed a protective knot around the two girls, talking and crying and hugging each other. The girls didn\u2019t seem to mind. Perhaps it was better this way. A warm welcome might do a lot to heal them.\nThe men held back, knowing they were useless in situations like this. Most watched from doorways or porches. Six or eight came down onto the street, moving slowly and eyeing up the situation. These were cautious men, farmers and friends of farmers.They knew the names of everyone within ten miles of their homes. There were no strangers in a town like Levinshir, except for me.\nNone of the men were close relatives to the girls. Even if they were, they knew they wouldn\u2019t get near them for at least an hour, maybe as much as a day. So they let their wives and sisters take care of things. With nothing else to occupy them, their attention wandered briefly past the horses and settled onto me.\nI motioned over a boy of ten or so. \u201cGo tell the mayor his daughter\u2019s back. Run!\u201d He tore off in a cloud of road dust, his bare feet flying.\nThe men moved slowly closer to me, their natural suspicion of strangers made ten times worse by recent events. A boy of twelve or so wasn\u2019t as cautious as the rest and came right up to me, eyeing my sword, my cloak.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I asked him.", "\u201cPete.\u201d\n\u201cCan you ride a horse, Pete?\u201d\nHe looked insulted. \u201cS\u2019nuf.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know where the Walker farm is?\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201c \u2019Bout north two miles by the millway.\u201d\nI stepped sideways and handed him the reins to the roan. \u201cGo tell them\ntheir daughter\u2019s home. Then let them use the horse to come back to town.\u201d He had a leg over the horse before I could offer him a hand up. I kept a\nhand on the reins long enough to shorten the stirrups so he wouldn\u2019t kill himself on the way there.\n\u201cIf you make it there and back without breaking your head or my horse\u2019s leg, I\u2019ll give you a penny,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll give me two,\u201d he said.\nI laughed. He wheeled the horse around and was gone.\nThe men had wandered closer in the meantime, gathering around me in a\nloose circle.\nA tall, balding fellow with a scowl and a grizzled beard seemed to appoint\nhimself leader. \u201cSo who\u2019re you?\u201d he asked, his tone speaking more clearly than his words, Who the hell are you?\n\u201cKvothe,\u201d I answered pleasantly. \u201cAnd yourself?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t know as that\u2019s any of your business,\u201d he growled. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d What the hell are you doing here with our two girls?\n\u201cGod\u2019s mother, Seth,\u201d an older man said to him. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the sense God gave a dog. That\u2019s no way to talk to the . . .\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t give me any of your lip, Benjamin,\u201d the scowling man bristled back. \u201cWe got a good right to know who he is.\u201d He turned to me and took a few steps in front of everyone else. \u201cYou one of those trouper bastards what came through here?\u201d\nI shook my head and attempted to look harmless. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cI think you are. I think you look kinda like one of them Ruh. You got them eyes.\u201d The men around him craned to get a better look at my face.\n\u201cGod, Seth,\u201d the old fellow chimed in again. \u201cNone of them had red hair. You remember hair like that. He ain\u2019t one of \u2019em.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would I bring them back if I\u2019d been one of the men who took them?\u201d I pointed out.\nHis expression grew darker and he continued his slow advance. \u201cYou gettin\u2019 smart with me, boy? Maybe you think all of us are stupid here? You", "think if you bring \u2019em back you\u2019ll get a reward or maybe we won\u2019t send anyone else out after you?\u201d He was almost within arm\u2019s reach of me now, scowling furiously.\nI looked around and saw the same anger lurking in the faces of all the men who stood there. It was the sort of anger that comes to a slow boil inside the hearts of good men who want justice, and finding it out of their grasp, decide vengeance is the next best thing.\nI tried to think of a way to calm the situation, but before I could do anything I heard Krin\u2019s voice lash out from behind me. \u201cSeth, you get away from him!\u201d\nSeth paused, his hands half raised against me. \u201cNow ...\u201d\nKrin was already stepping toward him. The knot of women loosened to release her, but stayed close. \u201cHe saved us, Seth,\u201d she shouted furiously. \u201cYou stupid shit-eater, he saved us. Where the hell were all of you? Why didn\u2019t you come get us?\u201d\nHe backed away from me as anger and shame fought their way across his face. Anger won. \u201cWe came,\u201d he shouted back. \u201cAfter we found out what happened we went after \u2019em. They shot out Bil\u2019s horse from under him, and he got his leg crushed. Jim got his arm stabbed, and old Cupper still ain\u2019t waked up from the thumping they give him. They almost killed us.\u201d\nI looked again and saw anger on the men\u2019s faces. Saw the real reason for it. The helplessness they had felt, unable to defend their town from the false troupe\u2019s rough handling. Their failure to reclaim the daughters of their friends and neighbors had shamed them.\n\u201cWell it wasn\u2019t good enough!\u201d Krin shouted back hotly, her eyes burning. \u201cHe came and got us because he\u2019s a real man. Not like the rest of you who left us to die!\u201d\nThe anger leapt out of a young man to my left, a farm boy, about seventeen. \u201cNone of this would have happened if you hadn\u2019t been running around like some Ruh whore!\u201d\nI broke his arm before I quite realized what I was doing. He screamed as he fell to the ground.\nI pulled him to his feet by the scruff of his neck. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I snarled into his face.\n\u201cMy arm!\u201d He gasped, his eyes showing me their whites. I shook him like a rag doll. \u201cName!\u201d\n\u201cJason,\u201d he blurted. \u201cGod\u2019s mother, my arm . . .\u201d", "I took his chin in my free hand and turned his face toward Krin and Ell. \u201cJason,\u201d I hissed quietly in his ear. \u201cI want you to look at those girls. And I want you to think about the hell they\u2019ve been through in these past days, tied hand and foot in the back of a wagon. And I want you to ask yourself what\u2019s worse. A broken arm, or getting kidnapped by a stranger and raped four times a night?\u201d\nThen I turned his face toward me and spoke so quiet that even an inch away it was hardly a whisper. \u201cAfter you\u2019ve thought of that, I want you to pray to God to forgive you for what you just said. And if you mean it, Tehlu grant your arm heal straight and true.\u201d His eyes were terrified and wet. \u201cAfter that, if you ever think an unkind thought about either of them, your arm will ache like there\u2019s hot iron in the bone. And if you ever say an unkind word, it will go to fever and slow rot and they\u2019ll have to cut it off to save your life.\u201d I tightened my grip on him, watching his eyes widen. \u201cAnd if you ever do anything to either of them, I\u2019ll know. I will come here, and kill you, and leave your body hanging in a tree.\u201d\nThere were tears on his face now, although whether from shame or fear or pain I couldn\u2019t guess. \u201cNow you tell her you\u2019re sorry for what you said.\u201d I let go of him after making sure he had his feet under him and pointed him in the direction of Krin and Ell. The women stood around them like a protective cocoon.\nHe clutched his arm weakly. \u201cI shouldn\u2019ta said that, Ellie,\u201d he sobbed, sounding more wretched and repentant than I would have thought possible, broken arm or no. \u201cIt was a demon talkin\u2019 out of me. I swear though, I been sick worryin\u2019. We all been. And we did try to come get you, but they was a lot of them and they jumped us on the road, then we had to bring Bil home or he would\u2019ve died from his leg.\u201d\nSomething tickled my memory about the boy\u2019s name. Jason? I suddenly suspected I had just broken Ell\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s arm. Somehow I couldn\u2019t feel bad for it just now. Best thing for him, really.\nLooking around I saw the anger bleed out of the faces of the men around me, as if I\u2019d used up the whole town\u2019s supply in a sudden, furious flash. Instead they watched Jason, looking slightly embarrassed, as if the boy were apologizing for the lot of them.\nThen I saw a big, healthy-looking man running down the street followed by a dozen other townsfolk. From the look on his face I guessed it was Ell\u2019s father, the mayor. He forced his way into the knot of women, gathered his", "daughter up in his arms, and swung her around.\nYou find two types of mayor in small towns like this. The first type are\nbalding, older men of considerable girth who are good with money and tend to wring their hands a great deal when anything unexpected happens. The second type are tall, broad-shouldered men whose families have grown slowly prosperous because they had worked like angry bastards behind a plow for twenty generations. Ell\u2019s father was the second sort.\nHe walked over to me, keeping one arm around his daughter\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI understand I have you to thank for bringing our girls back.\u201d He reached out to shake my hand and I saw his arm was bandaged. His grip was solid in spite of it. He smiled the widest smile I\u2019d seen since I left Simmon at the University.\n\u201cHow\u2019s the arm?\u201d I asked, not realizing how it would sound. His smile faded a little, and I was quick to add, \u201cI\u2019ve had some training as a physicker. And I know that those sort of things can be tricky to deal with when you\u2019re away from home.\u201d When you\u2019re living in a country that thinks mercury is medicine, I thought to myself.\nHis smile came back, and he flexed his fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s stiff, but that\u2019s all. Just a little meat. They caught us by surprise. I got my hands on one of them, but he stuck me and got away. How did you end up getting the girls away from those godless Ruh bastards?\u201d He spat.\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t Edema Ruh,\u201d I said, my voice sounding more strained than I would have liked. \u201cThey weren\u2019t even real troupers.\u201d\nHis smile began to fade again. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t Edema Ruh. We don\u2019t do the things they did.\u201d\n\u201cListen,\u201d the mayor said plainly, his temper starting to rise a bit. \u201cI know\ndamn well what they do and don\u2019t do. They came in all sweet and nice, played a little music, made a penny or two. Then they started to make trouble around town. When we told them to leave they took my girl.\u201d He almost breathed fire as he said the last words.\n\u201cWe?\u201d I heard someone say faintly behind me. \u201cJim, he said we.\u201d\nSeth scowled around the side of the mayor to get a look at me again. \u201cI told you he looked like one,\u201d he said triumphantly. \u201cI know \u2019em. You can always tell by them eyes.\u201d\n\u201cHold on,\u201d the mayor said with slow incredulity. \u201cAre you telling me you\u2019re one of them?\u201d His expression grew dangerous.\nBefore I could explain myself. Ell had grabbed his arm. \u201cOh, don\u2019t make", "him mad, Daddy,\u201d she said quickly, holding onto his good arm as if to pull him away from me. \u201cDon\u2019t say anything to get him angry. He\u2019s not with them. He brought me back, he saved me.\u201d\nThe mayor seemed somewhat mollified by this, but his congeniality was gone. \u201cExplain yourself,\u201d he said grimly.\nI sighed inside, realizing what a mess I\u2019d made of this. \u201cThey weren\u2019t troupers, and they certainly weren\u2019t Edema Ruh. They were bandits who killed some of my family and stole their wagons. They were only pretending to be performers.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would anyone pretend to be Ruh?\u201d the mayor asked, as if the thought were incomprehensible.\n\u201cSo they could do what they did,\u201d I snapped. \u201cYou let them into your town and they abused that trust. That\u2019s something no Edema Ruh would ever do.\u201d\n\u201cYou never did answer my question,\u201d he said. \u201cHow did you get the girls away?\u201d\n\u201cI took care of things,\u201d I said simply.\n\u201cHe killed them,\u201d Krin said loudly enough for everyone to hear. \u201cHe killed them all.\u201d\nI could feel everyone looking at me. Half of them were thinking, All of them? He killed seven men? The other half were thinking, There were two women with them, did he kill them too?\n\u201cWell, then.\u201d The mayor looked down at me for a long moment. \u201cGood,\u201d he said as if he had just made up his mind. \u201cThat\u2019s good. The world\u2019s a better place for it.\u201d\nI felt everyone relax slightly. \u201cThese are their horses.\u201d I pointed to the two horses that had been carrying our baggage. \u201cThey belong to the girls now. About forty miles east you\u2019ll find the wagons. Krin can show you where they\u2019re hidden. They belong to the girls too.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ll fetch a good price off in Temsford,\u201d the mayor mused.\n\u201cTogether with the instruments and clothes and such, they\u2019ll fetch a heavy penny,\u201d I agreed. \u201cSplit two ways, it\u2019ll make a fine dowry,\u201d I said firmly.\nHe met my eyes, nodded slowly in understanding. \u201cThat it will.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the things they stole from us?\u201d a stout man in an apron protested. \u201cThey smashed up my place and stole two barrels of my best ale!\u201d\n\u201cDo you have any daughters?\u201d I asked him calmly. The sudden, stricken look on his face told me he did. I met his eye, held it. \u201cThen I think you came away from this pretty well.\u201d", "The mayor finally noticed Jason clutching his broken arm. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d\nJason looked at his feet, and Seth spoke up for him, \u201cHe said some things he shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\nThe mayor looked around and saw that getting more of an answer would involve an ordeal. He shrugged and let it go.\n\u201cI could splint it for you,\u201d I said easily.\n\u201cNo!\u201d Jason said too quickly, then backpedaled. \u201cI\u2019d rather go to Gran.\u201d\nI gave a sideways look to the mayor. \u201cGran?\u201d\nHe gave a fond smile. \u201cWhen we scrape our knees Gran patches us back up\nagain.\u201d\n\u201cWould Bil be there?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe man with the crushed leg?\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cShe won\u2019t let him out of her sight for another span of days if I\nknow her.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll walk you over,\u201d I said to the sweating boy who was carefully cradling\nhis arm. \u201cI\u2019d like to watch her work.\u201d\nAs far from civilization as we were, I expected Gran to be a hunched old woman who treated her patients with leeches and wood alcohol.\nThat opinion changed when I saw the inside of her house. Her walls were covered with bundles of dry herbs and shelves lined with small, carefully labeled bottles. There was a small desk with three heavy leather books on it. One of them lay open, and I recognized it as The Heroborica. I could see handwritten notes scrawled in the margins, while some of the entries had been edited or crossed out entirely.\nGran wasn\u2019t as old as I\u2019d thought she\u2019d be, though she did have her share of grey hair. She wasn\u2019t hunched either, and actually stood taller than me, with broad shoulders and a round, smiling face.\nShe swung a copper kettle over the fire, humming to herself. Then she brought out a pair of shears and sat Jason down, prodding his arm gently. Pale and sweating, the boy kept up a constant stream of nervous chatter while she methodically cut his shirt away. In the space of a few minutes, without her even asking, he\u2019d given her an accurate if somewhat disjointed version of Ell and Krin\u2019s homecoming.\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a nice clean break,\u201d she said at last, interrupting him. \u201cHow\u2019d it happen?\u201d\nJason\u2019s wild eyes darted to me, then away. \u201cNothin\u2019,\u201d he said quickly. Then realized he hadn\u2019t answered the question. \u201cI mean ...\u201d\n\u201cI broke it,\u201d I said. \u201cFigured the least I could do was come along and see if there\u2019s anything I could do to help set it right again.\u201d\nGran looked back at me. \u201cHave you dealt with this sort of thing before?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve studied medicine at the University,\u201d I said.\nShe shrugged. \u201cThen I guess you can hold the splints while I wrap \u2019em. I\nhave a girl who helps me, but she run off when she heard the commotion up the street.\u201d\nJason eyed me nervously as I held the wood tight to his arm, but it took Gran less than three minutes to bind up the splint with an air of bored competence. Watching her work, I decided she was worth more than half the students I could name in the Medica.\nAfter we\u2019d finished she looked down at Jason. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky,\u201d she said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t need to be set. You hold off using it for a month, it should heal up just fine.\u201d\nJason left as quickly as he was able, and after a small amount of persuasion Gran let me see Bil, who was laid up in her back room.\nIf Jason\u2019s arm was a clean break, then Bil\u2019s was messy as a break can be. Both the bones in his lower leg had broken in several places. I couldn\u2019t see under the bandages, but his leg was hugely swollen. The skin above the bandages was bruised and mottled, stretched as tight as an overstuffed sausage.\nBil was pale but alert, and it looked like he would probably keep the leg. How much use it would be was another matter. He might come away with nothing more than a heavy limp, but I wouldn\u2019t bet on him ever running again.\n\u201cWhat sort of folk shoot a man\u2019s horse?\u201d he asked indignantly, his face covered in a sheen of sweat. \u201cIt ain\u2019t right.\u201d\nIt had been his own horse, of course. And this wasn\u2019t the sort of town where folk had horses to spare. Bil was a young man with a new wife and his own small farm, and he might never walk again because he\u2019d tried to do the right thing. It hurt to think about.\nGran gave him two spoonfuls of something from a brown bottle, and it dragged his eyes shut. She ushered us out of the room and closed the door", "behind her.\n\u201cDid the bone break the skin?\u201d I asked once the door was closed.\nShe nodded as she put the bottle back on the shelf.\n\u201cWhat have you been using to keep it from going septic?\u201d\n\u201cSour, you mean?\u201d she asked. \u201cRamsburr.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d I asked. \u201cNot arrowroot?\u201d\n\u201cArrowroot,\u201d she snorted as she added wood to the fire and swung the\nnow-steaming kettle off of it. \u201cYou ever tried to keep something from going sour with arrowroot?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I admitted.\n\u201cLet me save you the trouble of killing someone, then.\u201d She brought out a pair of wooden cups. \u201cArrowroot is useless. You can eat it if you like, but that\u2019s about it.\u201d\n\u201cBut a paste of arrowroot and bessamy is supposed to be ideal for this.\u201d\n\u201cBessamy might be worth half a damn,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut ramsburr is better. I\u2019d rather have some redblade, but we can\u2019t always have what we want. A paste of motherleaf and ramsburr is what I use, and you can see he\u2019s doing just fine. Arrowroot is easy for folk to find, and it pulps smooth, but it hain\u2019t got any worthwhile properties.\u201d\nShe shook her head. \u201cArrowroot and camphor. Arrowroot and bessamy. Arrowroot and saltbine. Arrowroot hain\u2019t a palliative of any sort. It\u2019s just good at carrying around what works.\u201d\nI opened my mouth to protest, then looked around her house, at her heavily annotated copy of The Heroborica. I closed my mouth.\nGran poured hot water from the kettle into two cups. \u201cSit yourself down for a bit,\u201d she said. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re on your last leg.\u201d\nI looked longingly at the chair. \u201cI should probably be getting back,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got time for a cup,\u201d she said, taking my arm and setting me firmly into the chair. \u201cAnd a quick bite. You\u2019re pale as a dry bone, and I have a bit of sweet pudding here that hain\u2019t got anybody to give it a home.\u201d\nI tried to remember if I\u2019d eaten any lunch today. I remembered feeding the girls.... \u201cI don\u2019t want to put you to any more trouble,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve already made more work for you.\u201d\n\u201cAbout time somebody broke that boy\u2019s arm,\u201d she said conversationally. \u201cHas a mouth on him like you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d She handed me one of the wooden cups. \u201cDrink that down and I\u2019ll get you some of that pudding.\u201d\nThe steam coming off the cup smelled wonderful. \u201cWhat\u2019s in it?\u201d I asked.", "\u201cRosehip. And some apple brandy I still up my own self.\u201d She gave a wide smile that crinkled the edges of her eyes. \u201cIf you like, I can put in some arrowroot, too.\u201d\nI smiled and sipped. The warmth of it spread through my chest, and I felt myself relax a bit. Which was odd, as I hadn\u2019t realized I\u2019d been tense before.\nGran bustled about a bit before setting two plates on the table and easing herself down into a nearby chair.\n\u201cYou really kill those folk?\u201d she asked plainly. There wasn\u2019t any accusation in her voice. It was just a question.\nI nodded.\n\u201cYou probably shouldn\u2019t have told anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s bound to be a fuss. They\u2019ll want a trial and have to bring in the azzie from Temsford.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t tell them,\u201d I said. \u201cKrin did.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d she said.\nThe conversation lulled. I drank the last swallow out of my cup, but when I\ntried to set it on the table my hands were shaking so badly that it knocked against the wood, making a sound like an impatient visitor at the door.\nGran sipped calmly from her cup.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care to talk about it,\u201d I said at last. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a good thing.\u201d \u201cSome folk might argue that,\u201d she said gently. \u201cI think you done the right\nthing.\u201d\nHer words brought a sudden hot ache behind my eyes, as if I were about to\nburst into tears. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure about that,\u201d I said, my voice sounding strange in my own ears. My hands were shaking worse now.\nGran didn\u2019t seem surprised by this. \u201cYou\u2019ve had the bit in your teeth for a couple days now, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Her tone made it clear it wasn\u2019t really a question. \u201cI know the look.You\u2019ve been keeping busy. Looking after the girls. Not sleeping. Probably not eating much.\u201d She picked up the plate. \u201cEat your pudding. It will help to get some food in you.\u201d\nI ate the pudding. Halfway through, I began to cry, choking a bit as it stuck in my throat.\nGran refilled my cup with more tea and poured another dollop of brandy in on top of it. \u201cDrink that down,\u201d she repeated.\nI took a swallow. I didn\u2019t mean to say anything, but I found myself talking anyway. \u201cI think there might be something wrong with me,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cA normal person doesn\u2019t have it in him to do the things I do. A normal person would never kill people like this.\u201d", "\u201cThat may be,\u201d she admitted, sipping from her own cup. \u201cBut what would you say if I told you Bil\u2019s leg had gone a bit green and sweet smelling under that bandage?\u201d\nI looked up, startled. \u201cHe\u2019s got the rot?\u201d\nShe shook her head. \u201cNo. I told you he\u2019s fine. But what if?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019d have to cut the leg off,\u201d I said.\nGran nodded seriously. \u201cThat\u2019s right. And we\u2019d have to do it quick. Today.\nNo dithering about and hoping he\u2019d fight his way through on his own. That wouldn\u2019t do a thing but kill him.\u201d She took a sip, watching me over the top of her cup, making it a question of sorts.\nI nodded. I knew it was true.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got some medicine,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know that proper doctoring means hard choices.\u201d She gave me an unflinching look. \u201cWe hain\u2019t like other folk. You burn a man with an iron to stop his bleeding. You save the mother and lose the babe. It\u2019s hard, and nobody ever thanks you for it. But we\u2019re the ones that have to choose.\u201d\nShe took another slow drink of tea. \u201cThe first few times are the worst. You\u2019ll get the shakes and lose some sleep. But that\u2019s the price of doing what needs to be done.\u201d\n\u201cThere were women too,\u201d I said, the words catching in my throat.\nGran\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cThey earned it twice as much,\u201d she said, and the sudden, furious anger in her sweet face caught me so completely by surprise that I felt prickling fear crawl over my body. \u201cA man who would do that to a girl is like a mad dog. He hain\u2019t hardly a person, just an animal needs to be put down. But a woman who helps him do it? That\u2019s worse. She knows what she\u2019s doing. She knows what it means.\u201d\nGran put her cup down gently on the table, her expression composed again. \u201cIf a leg goes bad, you cut it off.\u201d She made a firm gesture with the flat of her hand, then picked up her slice of pudding and began to eat it with her fingers. \u201cAnd some folk need killing. That\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d\nBy the time I got myself under control and made it back outside, the crowd in the street had swelled. The local tavern keeper had rolled a barrel onto his front landing and the air was sweet with the smell of beer.\n \nKrin\u2019s father and mother had ridden back into town on the roan. Pete was there too, having run back. He offered up his unbroken head for my inspection and demanded his two pennies for services rendered.\nI was warmly thanked by Krin\u2019s parents. They seemed to be good people. Most people are if given the chance. I caught hold of the roan\u2019s reins, and using him as a sort of portable wall I managed to get a moment of relatively private conversation with Krin.\nHer dark eyes were a little red around the edges, but her face was bright and happy. \u201cMake sure you get Lady Ghost,\u201d I said, nodding to one of the horses. \u201cShe\u2019s yours.\u201d The mayor\u2019s daughter would have a fair dowry no matter what, so I\u2019d loaded Krin\u2019s horse with the more valuable goods, as well as most of the false troupers\u2019 money.\nHer expression grew serious as she met my eyes, and again she reminded me of a young Denna. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving,\u201d she said.\nI guess I was. She didn\u2019t try to convince me to stay, and instead surprised me with a sudden embrace. After kissing me on the cheek she whispered in my ear, \u201cThank you.\u201d\nWe stepped away from each other, knowing propriety would only allow so much. \u201cDon\u2019t sell yourself short and marry some fool,\u201d I said, feeling as if I should say something.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you either,\u201d she said, her dark eyes mocking me gently.\nI took Greytail\u2019s reins and led her over to where the mayor stood, watching the crowd in a proprietary way. He nodded as I approached.\nI drew a deep breath. \u201cIs the constable about?\u201d\nHe raised an eyebrow at this, then shrugged and pointed off into the crowd. \u201cThat\u2019s him there. He was three-quarters drunk even before you brought our girls home, though. Don\u2019t know how much use he\u2019ll be to you now.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said hesitantly. \u201cI\u2019m guessing someone is going to need to lock me up until you can get word to the azzie off in Temsford.\u201d I nodded to the small stone building in the center of town.\nThe mayor looked sideways at me, frowning a bit. \u201cYou want to be locked up?\u201d\n\u201cNot particularly,\u201d I admitted.\n\u201cYou can come and go as you please then,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe azzie won\u2019t be happy when he hears,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019d rather not have\nanyone else go up against the iron law because of something I\u2019ve done. Aiding in the escape of a murderer can be a hanging offense.\u201d", "The big man gave me a long looking over. His eyes lingered a bit on my sword, the worn leather of my boots. I could almost feel him noticing the lack of any serious wounds despite the fact that I\u2019d just killed half a dozen armed men.\n\u201cSo you\u2019d let us just lock you up?\u201d he asked. \u201cEasy as that?\u201d\nI shrugged.\nHe frowned again, then shook his head as if he couldn\u2019t make sense of me.\n\u201cWell aren\u2019t you just as gentle as a lamb?\u201d he said wonderingly. \u201cBut no. I won\u2019t lock you up. You haven\u2019t done anything less than proper.\u201d\n\u201cI broke that boy\u2019s arm,\u201d I said.\n\u201cHmm,\u201d he rumbled darkly. \u201cForgot about that.\u201d He reached into his pocket and brought out ha\u2019penny. He handed it to me. \u201cMuch obliged.\u201d\nI laughed as I put it in my pocket.\n\u201cHere\u2019s my thought,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll head over and see if I can find the constable. Then I\u2019ll explain to him we\u2019ve got to lock you up. If you\u2019ve slipped off in the middle of this confusion, we wouldn\u2019t hardly be aiding in the escape, would we?\u201d\n\u201cIt would be negligence in maintenance of the law,\u201d I said. \u201cHe might take a few lashes for it, or lose his post.\u201d\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t come to that,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cBut if it does, he\u2019ll be happy to do it. He\u2019s Ellie\u2019s uncle.\u201d He looked out at the crowd on the street. \u201cWill fifteen minutes be enough for you to slip off in all the confusion?\u201d\n\u201cIf it\u2019s all the same to you,\u201d I said. \u201cCould you say I disappeared in a strange and mysterious way when your back was turned?\u201d\nHe laughed at this. \u201cDon\u2019t see why not. You need more than fifteen minutes on account of it being mysterious and all?\u201d\n\u201cTen should be a great plenty,\u201d I said as I unpacked my lute case and travelsack from Greytail and handed the mayor the reins. \u201cYou\u2019d be doing me a favor if you took care of him until Bil is up and about,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou leaving your horse?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cHe\u2019s just lost his.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cAnd we Ruh are used to walking. I wouldn\u2019t know what to do with a horse, anyway,\u201d I said half-honestly.\nThe big man gripped the reins and gave me a long look, as if he wasn\u2019t quite sure what to make of me. \u201cIs there anything we can do for you?\u201d he asked at last.\n\u201cRemember it was bandits who took them,\u201d I said as I turned to leave. \u201cAnd remember it was one of the Edema Ruh who brought them back.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-SIX": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-SIX\nInterlude\u2014Close to Forgetting\nKVOTHE HELD UP A hand to Chronicler. \u201cLet\u2019s take a moment, shall we?\u201d He looked around the dark inn. \u201cI\u2019ve let myself get a little caught up in the story. I should tend to a few things before it gets any later.\u201d\nThe innkeeper came stiffly to his feet and stretched. He lit a candle at the fireplace and moved around the inn, lighting the lamps one by one, driving back the dark by slow degrees.\n\u201cI was focused rather closely myself,\u201d Chronicler said, standing up and stretching. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d\n\u201cLate,\u201d Bast said. \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d\nChronicler looked out the dark window into the street. \u201cI\u2019d have thought you\u2019d have had at least a few folks in for dinner by now.You pulled a good crowd for lunch.\u201d\nKvothe nodded. \u201cWe would\u2019ve seen a few of my regulars if not for Shep\u2019s funeral.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d Chronicler looked down. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten. Is that something I\u2019ve kept you two from attending?\u201d\nKvothe lit the last lamp behind the bar and blew out his candle. \u201cNot really,\u201d he said. \u201cBast and I aren\u2019t from around these parts. And they\u2019re practical folk. They know I have a business to run, such as it is.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t get along with Abbe Leodin,\u201d Bast said.\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t get along with the local priest,\u201d Kvothe admitted. \u201cBut you should make an appearance, Bast. It will seem odd if you don\u2019t.\u201d\nBast\u2019s eyes darted around nervously. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave, Reshi.\u201d\nKvothe smiled warmly at him. \u201cYou should, Bast. Shep was a good man, go have a drink to send him off. In fact . . .\u201d He bent and rummaged around under the bar for a moment before coming up with a bottle. \u201cHere. A fine old bottle of brand. Better stuff than anyone around here asks for. Go share it around.\u201d He set it on the bar with a solid sound.\nBast took an involuntary step forward, his face conflicted. \u201cBut Reshi, I . .", ".\u201d\n\u201cPretty girls dancing, Bast,\u201d Kvothe said, his voice low and soothing.\n\u201cSomeone on the fiddle and all of them just glad to be alive. Kicking up their skirts to the music. Laughing and a little tipsy. Their cheeks all rosy and ready to be kissed. . . .\u201d He gave the heavy brown bottle a nudge, and it slid down the bar toward his student. \u201cYou\u2019re my ambassador to the town. I may be stuck minding the shop, but you can be there and make my apologies.\u201d\nBast closed his hand around the neck of the bottle. \u201cI\u2019ll have one drink,\u201d he said, his voice thick with resolve. \u201cAnd one dance. And one kiss with Katie Miller. And maybe another with the Widow Creel. But that\u2019s all.\u201d He looked Kvothe in the eye. \u201cI\u2019ll only be gone half an hour. . . .\u201d\nKvothe gave a warm smile. \u201cI have things to tend to, Bast. I\u2019ll cobble together dinner and we\u2019ll give our friend\u2019s hand a bit of a rest.\u201d\nBast grinned and picked up the bottle. \u201cTwo dances then!\u201d He bolted for the door, and when he opened it the wind gusted around him, swirling his hair wildly. \u201cSave me something to eat!\u201d He shouted over his shoulder.\nThe door banged shut.\nChronicler gave the innkeeper a curious look.\nKvothe gave a small shrug. \u201cHe was getting too tangled up in the story. He\ncan\u2019t feel a thing halfway. A little time away will give him some perspective. Besides, I do have dinner to prepare, even if it\u2019s only for three.\u201d\nThe scribe brought a grimy piece of cloth out of his leather satchel and looked at it with some distaste. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose I could trouble you for a clean rag?\u201d he asked.\nKvothe nodded and brought out a white linen cloth from beneath the bar. \u201cIs there anything else you need?\u201d\nChronicler stood and walked over to the bar. \u201cIf you had some strong spirits it would be a great help,\u201d he said, sounding slightly embarrassed. \u201cI hate to ask, but when I was robbed . . .\u201d\nKvothe waved the comment away. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cI should have asked you yesterday if there was anything you needed.\u201d He moved out from behind the bar toward the basement stairs. \u201cI\u2019m assuming wood alcohol would work best?\u201d\nChronicler nodded, and Kvothe disappeared into the basement. The scribe picked up the crisply folded square of linen and rubbed it idly between his fingers. Then his eyes wandered up to the sword hanging high on the wall behind the bar. The grey metal of the blade was striking against the dark", "wood of the mounting board.\nKvothe came back up the steps carrying a small clear bottle. \u201cIs there\nanything else you need? I have a good stock of paper and ink here too.\u201d\n\u201cIt may come to that by tomorrow,\u201d Chronicler said. \u201cI\u2019ve used up most of\nmy paper. But I can grind more ink tonight.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t put yourself to the trouble,\u201d Kvothe said easily.\u201cI have several\nbottles of fine Aruean ink.\u201d\n\u201cTrue Aruean ink?\u201d Chronicler asked, surprised.\nKvothe gave a broad smile and nodded.\n\u201cThat\u2019s terribly kind of you,\u201d Chronicler said, relaxing a bit. \u201cI\u2019ll admit I\nwasn\u2019t looking forward to spending an hour grinding tonight.\u201d He gathered up the clear bottle and cloth, then paused. \u201cWould you mind if I asked you a question? Unofficially, as it were?\u201d\nA smirk curled the corner of Kvothe\u2019s mouth. \u201cVery well then, unofficially.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t help notice that your description of Caesura doesn\u2019t . . .\u201d Chronicler hesitated. \u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t quite seem to match the actual sword itself.\u201d His eyes flicked to the sword behind the bar. \u201cThe hand guard isn\u2019t what you described.\u201d\nKvothe gave a wide grin. \u201cWell you\u2019re just sharp as anything, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t mean to imply\u2014\u201d Chronicler said quickly, looking embarrassed. Kvothe laughed a rich warm laugh. The sound of it tumbled around the\nroom, and for a moment the inn didn\u2019t feel empty at all. \u201cNo. You\u2019re absolutely right.\u201d He turned to look at the sword. \u201cThis isn\u2019t . . . what did the boy call it this morning?\u201d His eyes went distant for a moment, then he smiled again. \u201cKaysera. The poet killer.\u201d\n\u201cI was just curious,\u201d Chronicler said apologetically.\n\u201cAm I supposed to be offended that you\u2019re paying attention?\u201d Kvothe laughed again. \u201cWhat fun is there in telling a story if nobody\u2019s listening?\u201d He rubbed his hands together eagerly. \u201cRight then. Dinner. What would you like? Hot or cold? Soup or stew? I\u2019m a dab hand at pudding too.\u201d\nThey settled on something simple to avoid restoking the stove in the kitchen. Kvothe moved briskly around the inn, gathering what was needed. He hummed to himself as he fetched cold mutton and half a hard, sharp cheese from the basement.\n\u201cThese will be a nice surprise for Bast.\u201d Kvothe grinned at Chronicler as he brought out a jar of brined olives from the pantry. \u201cHe can\u2019t know we", "have them or he\u2019d have eaten them already.\u201d He untied his apron, pulling it off over his head. \u201cI think we have a few tomatoes left in the garden too.\u201d\nKvothe returned after several minutes with his apron wrapped into a bundle. He was spattered with rain and his hair was in wild disarray. He wore a boyish grin, and at that moment he looked very little like the somber, slowmoving innkeeper.\n\u201cIt can\u2019t quite decide if it wants to storm,\u201d he said as he set his apron on the bar, carefully removing the tomatoes. \u201cBut if it makes up its mind, we\u2019re in for a wagon-tipper tonight.\u201d He began to hum absentmindedly while he cut and arranged everything on a broad wooden platter.\nThe door of the Waystone opened and a sudden gust of wind made the lamplight flicker. Two soldiers came in, hunched against the weather, their swords sticking out like tails behind them. Dark spatters of rain spotted the fabric of their blue and white tabards.\nThey dropped their heavy packs, and the shorter of the two pressed his shoulder to the door, forcing it closed against the wind.\n\u201cGod\u2019s teeth,\u201d said the taller one, straightening his clothes. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad night to be caught in the open.\u201d He was bald on top, with a thick black beard that was flat as a spade. He looked at Kvothe, \u201cHo boy!\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cWe were glad to see your light. Run and fetch the owner, would you? We need to have a word with him.\u201d\nKvothe picked his apron up off the bar and ducked his head into it. \u201cThat would be me,\u201d he said, clearing his throat as he tied the strings around his waist. He ran his hands through his tousled hair, smoothing it down.\nThe bearded soldier peered at him, then shrugged. \u201cFair enough. Any chance of us getting a spot of dinner?\u201d\nThe innkeeper gestured to the empty room. \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem worth putting the kettle on tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got what you see here.\u201d\nThe two soldiers strode to the bar. The blonde one ran his hands through his curly hair, shaking a few drops of rain out of it. \u201cThis town looks deader than ditchwater,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see a single light but this.\u201d\n\u201cLong harvest day,\u201d the innkeeper said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a wake tonight at one of the nearby farms. The four of us are probably the only folk in town right now.\u201d He rubbed his hands together briskly. \u201cCan I interest you fine folk in a drink to take off the chill?\u201d He brought out a bottle of wine and sat it on the bar with a solid, satisfying sound.\n\u201cWell that\u2019s a difficulty,\u201d the blonde soldier said with a bit of an", "embarrassed smile. \u201cI\u2019d dearly love a drink, but my friend and I just took the king\u2019s coin.\u201d He reached into his pocket and brought out a bright gold coin. \u201cThis is all the money I have on me. I don\u2019t suppose you have enough to break a whole royal, would you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m stuck with mine too,\u201d the bearded soldier groused. \u201cMost money I\u2019ve ever had, but it don\u2019t spend well in a lump. Most of the towns we\u2019ve been through could barely make change for ha\u2019penny.\u201d He chuckled at his own joke.\n\u201cI should be able to help you out with that,\u201d the innkeeper said easily. The two soldiers exchanged a look. The blonde one nodded.\n\u201cRight then.\u201d The blonde soldier put the coin back in his pocket. \u201cHere\u2019s\nthe truth. We aren\u2019t really going to be stopping for the night.\u201d He picked up a piece of cheese off the bar and took a bite. \u201cAnd we aren\u2019t going to be paying for anything either.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d the innkeeper said. \u201cI see.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if you\u2019ve got enough money in your purse to change out two gold royals,\u201d the bearded one said eagerly, \u201cthen we\u2019ll have that off you as well.\u201d The blonde soldier spread his hands in a calming gesture. \u201cNow this don\u2019t\nneed to be any sort of ugly thing. We aren\u2019t bad folk. You pass over your purse and we go on our way. No folk get hurt, and nothing gets wrecked. It\u2019s bound to sting a bit.\u201d He raised an eyebrow at the innkeeper. \u201cBut a little sting beats hell out of getting yourself killed. Am I right?\u201d\nThe bearded soldier looked over at where Chronicler sat near the hearth. \u201cThis hain\u2019t got nothing to do with you, either,\u201d he said grimly, his beard waggling as he spoke. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anything of yours. You just stay sat where you\u2019re at and don\u2019t get feisty on us.\u201d\nChronicler shot a glance to the man behind the bar, but the innkeeper\u2019s eyes were fixed on the two soldiers.\nThe blonde one took another bite of cheese while his eyes wandered around the inn. \u201cYoung man like you is doing pretty well for himself. You\u2019ll be doing just as well after we\u2019re gone. But if you start trouble, we\u2019ll feed you your teeth, wreck up the place, and you\u2019ll still be out your purse.\u201d He dropped the rest of the cheese on the bar and clapped his hands together briskly. He smiled. \u201cSo, are we all going to be civilized folk?\u201d\n\u201cThat seems reasonable,\u201d Kvothe said as he walked out from behind the bar. He moved slowly and carefully, the way you would approach a skittish horse. \u201cI\u2019m certainly no barbarian.\u201d Kvothe reached down and removed his", "purse from his pocket. He held it out in one hand.\nThe blonde soldier walked over to him, swaggering just a bit. He took hold\nof the purse and hefted it appreciatively. He turned to smile at his friend. \u201cYou see, I told\u2014\u201d\nIn a smooth motion, Kvothe stepped forward and struck the man hard in the jaw. The soldier staggered and fell to one knee. The purse arced through the air and hit the floorboards with a solid metallic thud.\nBefore the soldier could do more than shake his head, Kvothe stepped forward and calmly kicked him in the shoulder. Not a sharp kick of the sort that breaks bones, but a hard kick that sent him sprawling backward. The man landed hard on the floor, rolling to a stop in a messy tangle of arms and legs.\nThe other soldier stepped past his friend, grinning wide under his beard. He was taller than Kvothe, and his fists were broad knots of scar and knuckle. \u201cRight cully,\u201d he said, dark satisfaction in his voice. \u201cYou\u2019re gettin\u2019 a kickin\u2019 now.\u201d\nHe snapped out a quick punch, but Kvothe stepped aside and kicked out sharply, hitting the soldier just above the knee. The bearded man grunted in surprise, stumbling slightly. Then Kvothe stepped close, caught the bearded man\u2019s shoulder, gripped his wrist, and twisted his outstretched arm at an awkward angle.\nThe big man was forced to bend over, grimacing in pain. Then he jerked his arm roughly out of the innkeeper\u2019s grip. Kvothe had half a moment to look startled before the soldier\u2019s elbow caught him in the temple.\nThe innkeeper staggered backward, trying to gain a little distance and a moment to clear his head. But the soldier followed close after him, fists raised, waiting for an opening.\nBefore Kvothe could regain his balance, the soldier stepped close and drove a fist hard into his gut. The innkeeper let out a pained huff of air, and as he started to double over the soldier swung his other fist into the side of the innkeeper\u2019s face, snapping Kvothe\u2019s head to the side and sending him reeling.\nKvothe managed to keep his feet by grabbing a nearby table for support. Blinking, he threw a wild punch to keep the bearded man at a distance. But the solider merely brushed it aside and caught hold of the innkeeper\u2019s wrist in one huge hand, easy as a father might grab hold of a wayward child in the street.\nBlood running down the side of his face, Kvothe struggled to free his wrist.", "Dazed, he made a quick motion with both hands, then repeated it, trying to pull away. His eyes half-focused and dull with confusion, he looked down at his wrist and made the motion again, but his hands merely scrabbled uselessly at the soldier\u2019s scarred fist.\nThe bearded soldier eyed the stupefied innkeeper with amused curiosity, then reached out and slapped him hard on the side of the head. \u201cYou\u2019re almost a bit of a scrapper, boy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou actually stuck one on me.\u201d\nBehind them, the blonde soldier was slowly getting to his feet. \u201cLittle bastard sucker-punched me.\u201d\nThe big soldier yanked the innkeeper\u2019s wrist so he stumbled forward. \u201cSay you\u2019re sorry, cully.\u201d\nThe innkeeper blinked blearily, opened his mouth as if he were about to speak, then staggered. Or rather, he seemed to stagger. Halfway through the stumbling motion became deliberate, and the innkeeper stomped down hard with the heel of his foot, aiming at the soldier\u2019s boot. At the same time he snapped his forehead down at the bearded man\u2019s nose.\nBut the big man merely laughed, moving his head to the side as he jerked the innkeeper off balance again by his wrist. \u201cNone of that,\u201d he chided, backhanding Kvothe across the face.\nThe innkeeper let out a yelp and lifted a hand to his bleeding nose. The soldier grinned and casually drove a knee hard into the innkeeper\u2019s groin.\nKvothe doubled over, first gasping soundlessly, then making a series of choked retching noises.\nMoving casually, the soldier let go of Kvothe\u2019s wrist, then reached out and picked up the bottle of wine from the bar. Gripping it by the neck, he swung it like a club. When it hit the side of the innkeeper\u2019s head, it made a solid, almost metallic sound.\nKvothe crumpled bonelessly to the floor.\nThe big man looked at the bottle of wine curiously before setting it back on the bar. Then he bent, grabbed the innkeeper\u2019s shirt, and dragged his limp body out onto the open floor. He nudged the unconscious body with a foot until it stirred sluggishly.\n\u201cSaid I\u2019d give you a kickin\u2019, boy,\u201d the soldier grunted, and drove his foot hard into Kvothe\u2019s side.\nThe blonde soldier walked over, rubbing at the side of his face. \u201cHad to get all clever, didn\u2019t you?\u201d he said, spitting on the floor. He drew back his boot and landed a hard kick of his own. The innkeeper drew a sharp, hissing", "breath, but made no other sound.\n\u201cAnd you . . .\u201d The bearded soldier pointed a thick finger at Chronicler.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got more than one boot. Would you like to see the other? I\u2019ve already skint my knuckles. It\u2019s no bother to me if you want to lose a couple teeth.\u201d\nChronicler looked around and seemed genuinely surprised to find himself standing. He lowered himself slowly back into his chair.\nThe blonde soldier limped off to reclaim the purse from where it had fallen, while the big bearded man remained standing over Kvothe. \u201cI suppose you figured you had to try,\u201d he said to the crumpled body, giving him another solid kick in the side. \u201cDamn fool. Pasty little innkeep against two of the king\u2019s own.\u201d He shook his head and spat again. \u201cHonestly, who do you think you are?\u201d\nCurled on the floor, Kvothe began to make a low, rhythmic sound. It was a dry, quiet noise that scratched around the edges of the room. Kvothe paused as he drew a painful breath.\nThe bearded soldier frowned and kicked him again. \u201cI asked you a question, cully . . .\u201d\nThe innkeeper made the same noise again, louder than before. Only then did it become obvious that he was laughing. Each low, broken chuckle sounded like he was coughing up a piece of shattered glass. Despite that, it was a laugh, full of dark amusement, as if the red-haired man had heard a joke that only he could understand.\nIt went on for some time. The bearded soldier shrugged and drew back his foot again.\nChronicler cleared his throat and the two men turned to look at him. \u201cIn the interest of keeping things civilized,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel I should mention that the innkeeper sent his assistant out on an errand. He should be back soon. . . .\u201d\nThe bearded soldier slapped his companion on the chest with the back of his hand. \u201cHe\u2019s right. Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d\n\u201cWait a moment,\u201d the blonde soldier said. He hurried back to the bar and snatched the bottle of wine. \u201cRight, let\u2019s go.\u201d\nThe bearded soldier grinned and went behind the bar, stepping on the innkeeper\u2019s body rather than over it. He grabbed a random bottle, knocking over half a dozen others as he did so. They rolled and spun on the counter between the two huge barrels, a tall, sapphire-colored one slowly toppling over the edge to shatter on the floor.\nIn less than a minute the men had gathered up their packs and were out the", "door.\nChronicler hurried over to where Kvothe lay on the wooden floor. The red-\nhaired man was already struggling into a sitting position.\n\u201cWell that was embarrassing,\u201d Kvothe said. He touched his bloody face\nand looked at his fingers. He chuckled again, a jagged, joyless sound. \u201cForgot who I was there for a minute.\u201d\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Chronicler asked.\nKvothe touched his scalp speculatively. \u201cI\u2019ll need a stitch or two, I suspect.\u201d\n\u201cWhat can I do to help?\u201d Chronicler asked, shifting his weight from foot to foot.\n\u201cDon\u2019t hover over me.\u201d Kvothe pushed himself awkwardly to his feet, then slumped into one of the tall stools at the bar. \u201cIf you want, you can fetch me a glass of water. And maybe a wet cloth.\u201d\nChronicler scurried back into the kitchen. There was the sound of frantic rummaging followed by several things falling to the ground.\nKvothe closed his eyes and leaned heavily against the bar.\n\u201cWhy is the door open?\u201d Bast called as he stepped through the doorway. \u201cIt\u2019s cold as a witch\u2019s tit in here.\u201d He froze, his expression stricken. \u201cReshi! What happened? What . . . I . . . What happened?\u201d\n\u201cAh Bast,\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cClose the door, would you?\u201d\nBast hurried over, a numb expression on his face. Kvothe sat in a stool at the bar, his face swollen and bloody. Chronicler stood next to him, dabbing awkwardly at the innkeeper\u2019s scalp with a damp cloth.\n\u201cI might need to prevail on you for a few stitches, Bast,\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cIf it wouldn\u2019t be too much trouble.\u201d\n\u201cReshi,\u201d Bast repeated. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cDevan and I got into a bit of an argument,\u201d Kvothe said, nodding at the scribe, \u201cabout the proper use of the subjunctive mood. It got a little heated toward the end.\u201d\nChronicler looked up at Bast, then blanched and took several quick steps backward. \u201cHe\u2019s joking!\u201d he said quickly, holding up his hands. \u201cIt was soldiers!\u201d\n \nKvothe chuckled painfully to himself. There was blood on his teeth. Bast looked around the empty taproom. \u201cWhat did you do with them?\u201d \u201cNot much, Bast,\u201d the innkeeper said. \u201cThey\u2019re probably miles away by\nnow.\u201d\n\u201cWas there something wrong with them, Reshi? Like the one last night?\u201d\nBast asked.\n\u201cJust soldiers, Bast,\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cJust two of the king\u2019s own.\u201d\nBast\u2019s face went ashen. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked. \u201cReshi, why did you let them\ndo this?\u201d\nKvothe gave Bast an incredulous look. He gave a brief, bitter laugh, then\nstopped with a wince, sucking air through his teeth. \u201cWell they seemed like such clean and virtuous boys,\u201d he said, his voice mocking. \u201cI thought, why not let these nice fellows rob me then beat me to a pulp?\u201d\nBast expression was full of dismay. \u201cBut you\u2014\u201d\nKvothe wiped away the blood that was threatening to run into his eye, then looked at Bast as if he were the stupidest creature drawing breath in the entire world. \u201cWhat?\u201d he demanded. \u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d\n\u201cTwo soldiers, Reshi?\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d Kvothe shouted. \u201cNot even two! Apparently one thick-fisted thug is all it takes to beat me half to death!\u201d He glared furiously at Bast, throwing up his arms. \u201cWhat is it going to take to shut you up? Do you want a story? Do you want to hear the details?\u201d\nBast took a step backward at the outburst. His face went even paler, his expression panicked.\nKvothe let his arms fall heavily to his sides. \u201cQuit expecting me to be something I\u2019m not,\u201d he said, still breathing hard. He hunched his shoulders and rubbed at his eyes, smearing blood across his face. He let his head sag wearily. \u201cGod\u2019s mother, why can\u2019t you just leave me alone?\u201d\nBast stood as still as a startled hart, his eyes wide.\nSilence flooded the room, thick and bitter as a lungful of smoke.\nKvothe drew a slow breath, the only motion in the room. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Bast,\u201d\nhe said without looking up. \u201cI\u2019m just in a little pain right now. It got the better of me. Give me a moment and I\u2019ll have it sorted out.\u201d\nStill looking down, Kvothe closed his eyes and drew several slow, shallow breaths. When he looked up, his expression was chagrined. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Bast,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to snap at you.\u201d\nA touch of the color returned to Bast\u2019s cheeks, and some of the tension left", "his shoulders as he gave a nervous smile.\nKvothe took the damp cloth from Chronicler and wiped the blood away\nfrom his eye again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I interrupted you before, Bast. What is it you were about ask me?\u201d\nBast hesitated, then said. \u201cYou killed five scrael not three days ago, Reshi.\u201d He waved toward the door. \u201cWhat\u2019s some thug compared to that?\u201d\n\u201cI picked the time and place for the scrael rather carefully, Bast,\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t exactly dance away unscathed, either.\u201d\nChronicler looked up, surprised. \u201cYou were hurt?\u201d he asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t know. You didn\u2019t look it. . . .\u201d\nA small, wry smile twisted the corner of Kvothe\u2019s mouth. \u201cOld habits die hard,\u201d he said. \u201cI do have a reputation to maintain. Besides, we heroes are only hurt in properly dramatic ways. It rather ruins the story if you find out Bast had to knit about ten feet of stitches into me after the fight.\u201d\nRealization broke over Bast\u2019s face like a sunrise. \u201cOf course!\u201d he said, his voice thick with relief. \u201cI forgot. You\u2019re still hurt from the scrael. I knew it had to be something like that.\u201d\nKvothe looked at the floor, every line of his body sagging and weary. \u201cBast . . .\u201d he began.\n\u201cI knew it, Reshi,\u201d Bast said emphatically. \u201cThere\u2019s no way some thug could get the better of you.\u201d\nKvothe drew a shallow breath, then let it out in a rush. \u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s it, Bast,\u201d he said easily. \u201cI expect I could have taken them both if I\u2019d been fresh.\u201d\nBast\u2019s expression grew uncertain again. He turned to face Chronicler. \u201cHow could you let this happen?\u201d he demanded.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not his fault, Bast,\u201d Kvothe said absentmindedly. \u201cI started the fight.\u201d He put a few fingers into his mouth and felt around gingerly. His fingers came out of his mouth bright with blood. \u201cI expect I\u2019m going to lose this tooth,\u201d he mused.\n\u201cYou will not lose your tooth, Reshi,\u201d Bast said fiercely. \u201cYou will not.\u201d\nKvothe made a slight motion with his shoulders, as if trying to shrug without moving any more of his body than he needed to. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter much in the grand scheme of things, Bast.\u201d He pressed the cloth to his scalp then looked at it. \u201cI probably won\u2019t need those stitches, either.\u201d He pushed himself upright on the stool. \u201cLet\u2019s have our dinner and get back to the story.\u201d He raised an eyebrow at Chronicler. \u201cIf you\u2019re still up for it, of", "course.\u201d\nChronicler stared at him blankly.\n\u201cReshi,\u201d Bast said, worried. \u201cYou\u2019re a mess.\u201d He reached out. \u201cLet me\nlook at your eyes.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not concussed, Bast,\u201d Kvothe said, irritated. \u201cI\u2019ve got four broken\nribs, a ringing in my ears, and a loose tooth. I have a few minor scalp wounds that look more serious than they really are. My nose is bloody but not broken, and tomorrow I will be a vast tapestry of bruises.\u201d\nKvothe gave the faint shrug again. \u201cStill, I\u2019ve had worse. Besides, they reminded me of something I was close to forgetting. I should probably thank them for that.\u201d He prodded at his jaw speculatively and worked his tongue around in his mouth. \u201cPerhaps not a terribly warm thanks.\u201d\n\u201cReshi, you need stitches,\u201d Bast said. \u201cAnd you need to let me do something about that tooth.\u201d\nKvothe climbed off the stool. \u201cI\u2019ll just chew on the other side for a few days.\u201d\nBast took hold of Kvothe\u2019s arm. His eyes were hard and dark. \u201cSit down Reshi.\u201d It was nothing like a request. His voice was low and sudden, like a throb of distant thunder. \u201cSit. Down.\u201d\nKvothe sat.\nChronicler nodded approvingly and turned to Bast. \u201cWhat can I do to help?\u201d\n\u201cStay out of my way,\u201d Bast said brusquely. \u201cAnd keep him in this chair until I get back.\u201d He strode upstairs.\nThere was a moment of silence.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Chronicler said. \u201cSubjunctive mood.\u201d\n\u201cAt best,\u201d Kvothe said, \u201cit is a pointless thing. It needlessly complicates\nthe language. It offends me.\u201d\n\u201cOh come now,\u201d Chronicler said, sounding slightly offended. \u201cThe\nsubjunctive is the heart of the hypothetical. In the right hands . . .\u201d He broke off as Bast stormed back into the room, scowling and carrying a small wooden box.\n\u201cBring me water,\u201d Bast said imperiously to Chronicler. \u201cFresh from the rain barrel, not from the pump. Then I need milk from the icebox, some warmed honey, and a broad bowl. Then clean up this mess and stay out of my way.\u201d\nBast washed the cut on Kvothe\u2019s scalp, then threaded one of his own hairs", "through a bone needle and laced four tight stitches through the innkeeper\u2019s skin more smoothly than a seamstress.\n\u201cOpen your mouth,\u201d Bast said, then peered inside, frowning while he prodded one of the back teeth with a finger. He nodded to himself.\nBast handed Kvothe the glass of water. \u201cRinse out your mouth, Reshi. Do it a couple times and spit the water back into the cup.\u201d\nKvothe did. When he finished the water was red as wine.\nChronicler returned with a bottle of milk. Bast sniffed it, then poured a splash into a wide pottery bowl. He added a dollop of honey and swirled it around to mix it. Finally, he dipped his finger into the glass of bloody water, drew it out, and let a single drop fall into the bowl.\nBast swirled it again and handed Kvothe the bowl. \u201cTake a mouthful of this,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t swallow it. Hold it in your mouth until I tell you.\u201d\nHis expression curious, Kvothe tipped the bowl and took a mouthful of the milk.\nBast took a mouthful as well. Then he closed his eyes for a long moment, a look of intense concentration on his face. Then he opened his eyes. He brought the bowl close to Kvothe\u2019s mouth and pointed into it.\nKvothe spat out his mouthful of milk. It was a perfect, creamy white.\nBast brought the bowl to his own mouth and spat. It was a frothy pink. Kvothe\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cBast,\u201d he said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\nBast made a sharp gesture with one hand, his eyes still hard. \u201cI did not ask\nfor your opinion, Reshi.\u201d\nThe innkeeper looked down, uncomfortable. \u201cIt\u2019s more than you should\ndo, Bast.\u201d\nThe dark young man reached out and laid a gentle hand on the side of his\nmaster\u2019s face. For a moment he looked tired, weary through to the bone. Bast shook his head slowly, wearing an expression of bemused dismay. \u201cYou are an idiot, Reshi.\u201d\nBast drew his hand back, and the weariness was gone. He pointed across the bar where Chronicler stood watching. \u201cBring the food.\u201d He pointed at Kvothe. \u201cTell the story.\u201d\nThen he spun on his heel, walked back to his chair by the hearth, and lowered himself into it as if it were a throne. He clapped his hands twice, sharply. \u201cEntertain me!\u201d he said with a wide, mad smile. And even from where the others stood near the bar, they could see the blood on his teeth.", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-SEVEN": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-SEVEN\nQuestions\nWHILE THE MAYOR OF Levinshir seemed to approve of how I\u2019d handled the false troupers, I knew matters weren\u2019t as simple as that. According to the iron law, I was guilty of at least three egregious crimes, any one of which would be enough to see me hanged.\nUnfortunately, everyone in Levinshir knew my name and description, and I worried the story might run ahead of me on the road. If that happened, I could easily come to a town where the local constables would do their duty and lock me up until a traveling magistrate arrived to judge my case.\nSo I made my best speed toward Severen. I put in two days of hard walking, then paid for a seat on a coach heading south. Rumor travels fast, but you can keep ahead of it if you\u2019re willing to ride hard and lose a little sleep.\nAfter three days of bone-jarring ride, I arrived in Severen. The coach entered the city by the eastern gate, and for the first time I saw the gibbet Bredon had told me about. The sight of the bleached bones in the iron cage did not ease my anxieties. The Maer had put a man in there for simple banditry. What might he do to someone who had slaughtered nine traveling players on the road?\nI was sorely tempted to head straight to the Four Tapers, where I hoped to find Denna despite what the Cthaeh had said. But I was covered in several days of grime and sweat. I needed a bath and a brush before I spoke with anyone.\nAs soon as I was inside the Maer\u2019s estate I sent a ring and note to Stapes, knowing it would be the quickest way to get in touch with the Maer for a private conversation. I made it back to my room with little delay, though it meant brushing roughly past a few courtiers in the halls. I had just set down my travelsack and sent runners for hot water when Stapes appeared in the doorway.\n\u201cYoung Master Kvothe!\u201d he beamed, grabbing my hand to shake it. \u201cIt\u2019s", "good to have you back. Lord and lady, but I\u2019ve been worried about you.\u201d\nHis enthusiasm wrung a tired smile from me. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be back, Stapes.\nHave I missed much?\u201d\n\u201cMuch?\u201d He laughed. \u201cThe wedding for one.\u201d\n\u201cWedding?\u201d I asked, but I knew the answer as soon as I said it. \u201cThe\nMaer\u2019s wedding?\u201d\nStapes nodded excitedly. \u201cOh, it was a grand thing. It\u2019s a shame you had to\nbe gone for it, considering.\u201d He gave a knowing look, but didn\u2019t say anything else. Stapes was always very discreet.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t waste much time, did they?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been two months since the betrothal,\u201d Stapes said with a hint of reproach. \u201cNot a bit less than proper.\u201d I saw him relax a bit, and he gave me a wink. \u201cWhich isn\u2019t to say they weren\u2019t both a bit eager.\u201d\nI chuckled as runner boys came through the open door with buckets of steaming water. The splashing as they began to fill the bath was like sweet music.\nThe manservant watched them leave, then leaned close and said in a quieter voice, \u201cYou\u2019ll be glad to hear our other unresolved matter has been tended to properly.\u201d\nI looked at him blankly, searching through my memory for what he might be referring to. So much had happened since I\u2019d left....\nStapes saw my expression. \u201cCaudicus,\u201d he said, his mouth twisting bitterly around the name. \u201cDagon brought him back only two days after you left. He\u2019d gone to ground not ten miles from the city.\u201d\n\u201cSo close?\u201d I asked, surprised.\nStapes nodded grimly. \u201cHe was tucked away in a farmhouse like a badger in a burrow. He killed four of the Maer\u2019s personal guard and cost Dagon an eye. In the end they only caught him by setting fire to the place.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what happened then?\u201d I asked. \u201cNot a trial, certainly.\u201d\n\u201cThe matter was tended to,\u201d Stapes repeated. \u201cProperly.\u201d He said the last with a great weight of grim finality. His normally kind eyes were narrow with hate. In that moment the round-faced little man looked very little like a grocer at all.\nI remembered Alveron calmly saying, \u201ctake off his thumbs.\u201d Given what I knew of Alveron\u2019s swift and decisive anger, I doubted anyone would ever see Caudicus again.\n\u201cDid the Maer manage to uncover why?\u201d Even though I spoke softly, I left", "the rest unsaid, knowing Stapes would not approve of my mentioning the poisoning openly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my place to say,\u201d Stapes said carefully. His tone was slightly offended, as if I should know better than to ask him such things.\nI let the subject go, knowing that I wouldn\u2019t be able to get anything else out of Stapes. \u201cYou\u2019d be doing me a favor if you could deliver something to the Maer for me,\u201d I said, walking to where I\u2019d dropped my worn travelsack. I rooted through it until I found the Maer\u2019s lockbox down near the bottom.\nI held it out to Stapes. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s in it,\u201d I said. \u201cBut it\u2019s got his crest on the top. And it\u2019s heavy. I hope it might be some of the taxes that were stolen.\u201d I smiled. \u201cTell him it\u2019s a wedding present.\u201d\nStapes took hold of the box, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be delighted.\u201d\nThree more runners appeared, but only two of them ran past with steaming buckets. The third went to Stapes and handed him a note. There was more splashing in the other room, and all three of the boys left again, stealing glances at me\nStapes skimmed the note then looked up at me. \u201cThe Maer is hoping it would be convenient for you to meet him in the garden at fifth bell,\u201d he said.\nThe garden meant polite conversation. If the Maer had wanted a serious discussion he would have summoned me to his rooms, or paid me a call through the secret passage that connected his rooms with mine.\nI looked at the clock on the wall. It wasn\u2019t a sympathy clock of the sort I was used to at the University. This was a harmony clock, swinging pendulum and all. Beautiful machinery, but not nearly as accurate. Its hands showed a quarter to the hour.\n\u201cIs that clock fast, Stapes?\u201d I asked hopefully. Fifteen minutes was barely enough time for me to strip out of my road clothes and lace myself into some sufficiently decorous court finery. But given the layers of dirt and sour sweat that covered me, that would be as pointless as tying a silk ribbon around a steaming cowpat.\nStapes looked over my shoulder, then checked a small gear watch he kept in his pocket. \u201cIt looks about five minutes slow, actually.\u201d\nI rubbed my face, considering my options. I wasn\u2019t simply mussed from a day\u2019s travel. I was filthy. I had walked hard under the summer sun, then spent days trapped in a stifling-hot carriage. While the Maer was not one to judge things entirely by appearances, he did value propriety. I would not make a good impression if I showed up reeking and filthy.", "Unbidden, the memory of the iron gibbet rose up in my mind, and I decided I couldn\u2019t risk making a bad impression. Not with the news I brought. \u201cStapes, I won\u2019t be ready for at least an hour. I could meet with him at sixth bell if he would like.\u201d\nStapes\u2019 expression turned stiff and affronted. Its message was clear. You simply didn\u2019t request a different meeting time with the Maer Alveron. He asked. You came. That was the way of things.\n\u201cStapes,\u201d I said as gently as I could. \u201cLook at me. Smell me. I\u2019ve come three hundred miles in the last span of days. I\u2019m not going to go strolling in the garden covered in road dust and reeking like a barbarian.\u201d\nStapes\u2019 mouth firmed into a frown. \u201cI\u2019ll tell him you\u2019re otherwise occupied.\u201d\nMore steaming buckets arrived. \u201cTell him the truth, Stapes,\u201d I said as I began to unbutton my shirt. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll understand.\u201d\nAfter I was scrubbed, brushed, and properly dressed, I sent the Maer my golden ring and a card that said, \u201cPrivate conversation at your earliest convenience.\u201d\nWithin an hour a runner returned with a card from the Maer saying, \u201cAwait my summons.\u201d\nI waited. I sent a runner to fetch dinner, then waited the rest of the evening. The following day passed without any further message. And, because I didn\u2019t know when Alveron\u2019s summons might come, I was effectively trapped in my rooms again, waiting for his ring.\nIt was nice to have time to catch up on my sleep and have a second bath. But I was worried about the news from Levinshir catching up with me. The fact that I couldn\u2019t make my way down to Severen-Low to look for Denna was a vast irritation as well.\nIt was the sort of silent rebuke all too common in courtly settings. The Maer\u2019s message was clear: When I call, you come. My terms or not at all.\nIt was childish in the way only the nobility can be. Still, there was nothing to be done. So I sent my silver ring to Bredon. He arrived in time to share supper with me and caught me up on the season\u2019s worth of gossip I\u2019d missed. Court rumor can be terribly insipid stuff, but Bredon skimmed the cream off\n \nthe top for me.\nMost of it centered around the Maer\u2019s whirlwind courtship and marriage to\nthe Lackless heir. They were besotted with each other, apparently. Many suspected a child might already be on the way. The royal court in Renere was busy too. The Prince Regent Alaitis had been killed in a duel, sending much of the southern farrel into chaos as various nobility did their best to capitalize on the death of such a highly ranked member of the court.\nThere were rumors too. The Maer\u2019s men had taken care of some bandits off in a remote piece of the Eld. They\u2019d been waylaying tax collectors, apparently. There was grumbling in the north, where folk had to suffer a second visit from the Maer\u2019s collectors. But at least the roads were clear again, and those responsible were dead.\nBredon also mentioned an interesting rumor of a young man who had gone to visit Felurian and come back more or less intact, though slightly fae around the edges. It wasn\u2019t a court rumor, exactly. More the sort of thing you heard in a taproom. A low sort of rumor no highborn person would ever deign to lend an ear to. His dark, owlish eyes glittered merrily as he spoke.\nI agreed that such stories were indeed quite low, and beneath the notice of fine persons such as ourselves. My cloak? It was rather fine, was it not? I couldn\u2019t remember where exactly I\u2019d had it tailored. Somewhere exotic. By the way, I\u2019d heard quite an interesting song the other day on the subject of Felurian. Would he like to hear it?\nWe also played tak, of course. Despite the fact that I had spent a long time away from the board, Bredon said my playing was much improved. It seemed I was learning how to play a beautiful game.\nNeedless to say, when Alveron sent his next summons, I came. I was tempted to arrive a few minutes late, but I resisted, knowing no good could come of it. The Maer was walking about on his own when I met him in the garden. He\nstood straight and tall, looking for all the world as if he\u2019d never needed to lean on my arm or use a walking stick.\n\u201cKvothe,\u201d he smiled warmly. \u201cI\u2019m glad you could find time to visit me.\u201d \u201cAlways my pleasure, your grace.\u201d\n\u201cShall we walk?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe view is pleasant from the south bridge\n \nthis time of day.\u201d\nI fell into step beside him, and we began to wind our way among the\ncarefully tended hedges.\n\u201cI could not help but notice that you are armed,\u201d he remarked, disapproval\nheavy on his voice.\nMy hand went unconsciously to Caesura. It was at my hip now, rather than\nover my shoulder. \u201cIs there aught amiss with that, your grace? I have understood that all men keep the right to gird themselves in Vintas.\u201d\n\u201cIt is hardly proper.\u201d He stressed the word.\n\u201cI understand that in the king\u2019s court in Renere, there\u2019s not a gentleman would dare be seen without a sword.\u201d\n\u201cWell-spoken as you are, you are no gentleman,\u201d Alveron pointed out coolly, \u201cas you would do well to remember.\u201d\nI said nothing.\n\u201cBesides, it is a barbarian custom, and one that will bring the king to grief in time. No matter what the custom in Renere, in my city, my house, and my garden, you will not come before me armed.\u201d He turned to look at me with hard eyes.\n\u201cI apologize if I have given any offense, your grace.\u201d I stopped and offered him a more earnest bow than the one I\u2019d given before.\nMy show of submission seemed to appease him. He smiled and laid a hand on my shoulder. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for all that. Come, look at the mourningfire. The leaves will be turning soon.\u201d\nWe walked for a piece of an hour, chatting amiably about small nothings. I was unfailingly polite and Alveron\u2019s mood continued to improve. If catering to his ego kept me in his good graces, it was a small price to pay for his patronage.\n\u201cI must say that marriage suits your grace.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d He nodded graciously. \u201cI have found it much to my liking.\u201d \u201cAnd your health continues well?\u201d I asked, pressing the boundaries of\npublic conversation.\n\u201cExceeding well,\u201d he said. \u201cAnother benefit of married life, no doubt.\u201d He\ngave me a look that told me he would not appreciate further inquiry, at least not in so public a place as this.\nWe continued our walk, nodding to the nobles we passed. The Maer chatted on about trivialities, rumors in the court. I played along, filling my part in the conversation. But the truth was, I needed to have done with this so", "we could have an earnest conversation in private.\nBut I also knew Alveron could not be rushed into a discussion. Our talks\nhad a ritual pattern. If I violated that, I would do nothing but annoy him. So I bided my time, smelled the flowers, and pretended interest in the gossip of the court.\nAfter a quarter hour, there was a characteristic pause in the conversation. Next we would engage in an argument. After that we could go somewhere private enough to speak of important matters.\n\u201cI have always thought,\u201d Alveron said at last, introducing the topic of our discussion, \u201cthat everyone has a question that rests in the center of who they are.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you mean, your grace?\u201d\n\u201cI believe everyone has some question that drives them. A question that keeps them awake nights. A question they worry like a dog with an old bone. If you understand a man\u2019s question, it brings you closer to understanding the man himself.\u201d He looked sideways at me, half-smiling. \u201cOr so I have always believed.\u201d\nI thought on it for a moment. \u201cI would have to agree with you, your grace.\u201d\nAlveron raised an eyebrow at this. \u201cAs easy as that?\u201d He sounded slightly disappointed. \u201cI was expecting a bit of a struggle from you.\u201d\nI shook my head, glad for the easy opportunity to introduce a topic of my own. \u201cI\u2019ve been worrying at a question for some years now, and I expect I will worry it some few years more. So what you say makes a perfect sense to me.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d he said hungrily. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\nI considered telling him the truth. About my search for the Chandrian and the death of my troupe. But there was no real chance of that. That secret still sat in my heart, heavy as a great smooth stone. It was too personal a thing to tell someone as clever as the Maer. What\u2019s more, it would reveal my Edema Ruh blood, something I had not made public knowledge in the Maer\u2019s court. The Maer knew I wasn\u2019t nobility, but he didn\u2019t know my blood was quite so low as that.\n\u201cIt must be a heavy question for you to take so long in weighing it,\u201d Alveron joked as I hesitated. \u201cCome, I insist. In fact I will offer you a trade, a question for a question. Mayhap we will help each other to an answer.\u201d\nI could hardly hope for better encouragement than that. I thought for a moment, choosing my words carefully. \u201cWhere are the Amyr?\u201d", "\u201cThe bloody-handed Amyr,\u201d Alveron mused softly to himself. He glanced sideways at me. \u201cI assume you are not asking where their bodies are bestowed?\u201d\n\u201cNo, your grace,\u201d I said somberly.\nHis face turned thoughtful. \u201cInteresting.\u201d I drew a relieved breath. I had half expected him to give a flip response, to tell me the Amyr were centuries dead. Instead he said, \u201cI studied the Amyr a great deal when I was younger, you know.\u201d\n\u201cTruly, your grace?\u201d I said, surprised by my own good luck.\nHe looked at me, a ghost of a smile touching his lips. \u201cNot that surprising. I wanted to be one of the Amyr when I was a boy.\u201d He looked ever so slightly embarrassed. \u201cNot all the stories are dark, you know. They did important things. They made hard choices that no one else was willing to. That sort of thing frightens people, but I believe they were a great force for good.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always thought so too,\u201d I admitted. \u201cOut of curiosity, which was your favorite story?\u201d\n\u201cAtreyon,\u201d Alveron said a little wistfully. \u201cI haven\u2019t thought of that in years. I could probably recite the Eight Oaths of Atreyon from memory.\u201d He shook his head and glanced in my direction. \u201cAnd you?\u201d\n\u201cAtreyon is a bit bloody for me,\u201d I admitted.\nAlveron looked amused. \u201cThey weren\u2019t called the bloody-handed Amyr for nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tattoos of the Ciradae were hardly decorative.\u201d\n\u201cTrue,\u201d I admitted. \u201cStill, I prefer Sir Savien.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, nodding. \u201cYou\u2019re a romantic.\u201d\nWe walked in silence for a moment, turning a corner and strolling past a\nfountain. \u201cI was enamored with them as a child,\u201d Alveron said at last, as if confessing something slightly embarassing. \u201cMen and women with all the power of the church behind them. And that was at a time when all the power of Atur stood behind the church.\u201d He smiled. \u201cBrave, fierce, and answerable to no one save themselves and God.\u201d\n\u201cAnd other Amyr,\u201d I added.\n\u201cAnd, ultimately, the pontifex,\u201d he finished. \u201cI assume you\u2019ve read his proclamation declaiming them?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nWe came to a small arching bridge of wood and stone, then stopped at the top of the arch and looked out over the water, watching the swans maneuver", "slowly on the current. \u201cDo you know what I found when I was younger?\u201d the Maer asked.\nI shook my head.\n\u201cOnce I\u2019d grown too old for children\u2019s stories of the Amyr, I started wondering more specific things. How many Amyr were there? How many were gentry? How many horse could they put to field for an armed action?\u201d He turned slightly to gauge my reaction. \u201cI was in Felton at the time. They have an old Aturan mendary where they keep church records for the whole of the northern farrel. I looked through their books for two days. Do you know what I found?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d I said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t find anything.\u201d\nAlveron turned to look at me. His expression held a carefully controlled surprise.\n\u201cI found the same thing at the University,\u201d I said. \u201cIt seemed as if someone had removed information about the Amyr from the Archives there. Not everything, of course. But there were scarce few solid details.\u201d\nI could see the Maer\u2019s own conclusions sparking to life behind his clever grey eyes. \u201cAnd who would do such a thing?\u201d he prompted.\n\u201cWho would have better reason than the Amyr themselves?\u201d I said. \u201cWhich means they are still around, somewhere.\u201d\n\u201cThus your question.\u201d Alveron started walking again, slower than before. \u201cWhere are the Amyr?\u201d\nWe left the bridge and began to walk the path around the pond, the Maer\u2019s face full of serious thought. \u201cWould you believe I had the same thought after searching in the mendary?\u201d he asked me. \u201cI thought the Amyr might have avoided being brought to trial. Gone into hiding. I thought there might even be Amyr in the world after all this while, acting in secret for the greater good.\u201d\nI could feel the excitement bubbling in my chest. \u201cWhat did you discover?\u201d I asked eagerly.\n\u201cDiscover?\u201d Alveron looked surprised. \u201cNothing. My father died that year and I became Maer. I dismissed it as a boyish fancy.\u201d He looked out over the water and the gently gliding swans. \u201cBut if you found this same thing half a world away. . . .\u201d He trailed off.\n\u201cAnd I drew the same conclusion, your grace.\u201d\nAlveron nodded slowly. \u201cIt is disturbing that there might be a secret this important.\u201d He looked around the garden at the walls of his estate. \u201cAnd in", "my own lands. I don\u2019t like that.\u201d He turned back to me, his eyes sharp and clear. \u201cHow do you propose to search them out?\u201d\nI smiled ruefully. \u201cAs your grace pointed out, no matter how well-spoken or well-educated I am, I will never be nobility. I lack the connections and the resources to research this as thoroughly as I would like. But with your name to open doors, I could make a search of many private libraries. I could access archives and records too private or too hidden to be pruned. . . .\u201d\nAlveron nodded, his eyes not leaving mine. \u201cI think I understand you. I, for one, would give a great deal to know the truth of this matter.\u201d\nHe looked away as the sound of laughter drifted upward, mixing with the footsteps of a group of approaching nobles. \u201cYou\u2019ve given me a great deal to think about,\u201d he said in softer tones. \u201cWe will discuss this further in more privacy.\u201d\n\u201cWhat time would be convenient for you to meet, your grace?\u201d\nAlveron gave me a long, speculative look. \u201cCome to my rooms this evening. And since I cannot give you an answer, let me offer you a question of my own instead.\u201d\n\u201cI value questions near as much, your grace.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-EIGHT": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-EIGHT\nNotes\nWITH NEARLY FIVE HOURS until my meeting with the Maer, I was finally free to go about my business in Severen-Low. From the horse lifts, the sky was so clear and blue it could break your heart to look at it. With that in mind, I made my way to the Four Tapers inn.\nThe taproom wasn\u2019t busy, so it isn\u2019t surprising that the innkeeper spotted me heading toward the back stairs. \u201cStop you!\u201d he called out in broken Aturan. \u201cPay! Room only for paying men!\u201d\nNot wanting a scene, I approached the bar. The innkeeper was a thin, greasy man with a thick Lenatti accent. I smiled at him. \u201cI was just visiting a friend. The woman in room three. Long dark hair.\u201d I gestured to show how long. \u201cIs she still here?\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d he said, giving me a knowing look. \u201cThe girl. Her name Dinay?\u201d\nI nodded, knowing Denna changed her name as often as some other women changed their hair.\nThe greasy man nodded again. \u201cYes. The pretty dark eyes? She gone for long.\u201d\nMy heart fell, despite the fact that I\u2019d known better than to hope she would still be here after all this time. \u201cDo you know where she might have gone?\u201d\nHe barked a short laugh. \u201cNo. You and all the other wolves come sniffing after her. I could have sold knowing to you all to made a thick purse. But no, I haen\u2019t idea.\u201d\n\u201cMight she have left a message for me?\u201d I asked without real hope. I hadn\u2019t found any letter or note waiting for me at Alveron\u2019s estate. \u201cShe was expecting me to find her here.\u201d\n\u201cWas she?\u201d he said mockingly, then seemed to remember something. \u201cI think there a note found. Might be. Not much a reader me. You would like it?\u201d He smiled.\nI nodded, my heart lifting a little.\n\u201cShe left without payment in her room,\u201d he said. \u201cSeventeen and a half", "pennies.\u201d\nI brought out a silver round and showed it to him. He reached for it, but I\nset it on the table and held it there with two fingers.\nHe scurried off into a back room and was gone for a long five minutes. He\nfinally returned with a tightly folded piece of paper clutched in one hand. \u201cI am find it,\u201d he said triumphantly, waving it in my direction. \u201cNot much good for paper here but kindling.\u201d\nI looked at the piece of paper and felt my spirits lift. It was folded against itself in the same fashion as the letter I\u2019d had the tinker deliver. If she\u2019d copied that trick, it meant she must have read my letter and left this note for me. Hopefully it would tell me where she had gone. How to find her. I slid the coin toward the innkeeper and took the note.\nOnce outside, I hurried to the shadow of a recessed doorway, knowing it was the closest thing to privacy I would find on the busy street. I tore the note open carefully, unfolded it, and edged into the light. It read:\nDenna,\nI have been forced to leave town on an errand for my patron. I will be\naway some time, perhaps several span. It was sudden and unavoidable, else I would have made a point to see you before I left.\nI regret many of the things I said when we last spoke and wish I could apologize for them in person.\nI will find you when I return. Yours,\nKvothe\nAt eighth bell I made my way to the Maer\u2019s rooms, leaving Caesura behind. I felt oddly naked without it. It\u2019s strange how quickly we become accustomed to such things.\nStapes showed me into the Maer\u2019s sitting room, and Alveron sent his manservant to invite Meluan to join us at her convenience. I wondered idly what would happen if she decided not to come? Would he ignore her for three days in silent rebuke?\n \nAlveron settled onto a couch and gave me a speculative look. \u201cI\u2019ve heard some rumors surrounding your recent excursion,\u201d he said. \u201cSome rather fantastic things I\u2019m not given to believing. Perhaps you\u2019d like to tell me what really happened.\u201d\nFor a moment I wondered how he\u2019d managed to hear about my activities near Levinshir so quickly. Then I realized he wanted to know the details of our bandit hunt in the Eld. I breathed a mental sigh of relief. \u201cI trust Dedan found you easily enough?\u201d I asked.\nAlveron nodded.\n\u201cI regretted having to send him in my stead, your grace. He is not a subtle creature.\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cNo real harm was done. By the time he came to me the need for secrecy was past.\u201d\n\u201cHe did deliver my letter then?\u201d\n\u201cAh yes, the letter.\u201d Alveron pulled it out of a nearby drawer. \u201cI assumed it was some sort of odd joke.\u201d\n\u201cYour grace?\u201d\nHe gave me a frank stare, then looked down at my letter. \u201cTwenty-seven men,\u201d he read aloud. \u201cExperienced mercenaries by their actions and appearance . . . A well-established camp with rudimentary fortifications.\u201d He looked up again, \u201cYou can\u2019t expect me to believe this as the truth. The five of you couldn\u2019t possibly succeed against so many.\u201d\n\u201cWe surprised them, your grace,\u201d I said with a certain smug understatement.\nThe Maer\u2019s expression soured. \u201cCome now, all provincial humor aside, I consider this to be in extremely poor taste. Simply tell me the truth and have done.\u201d\n\u201cI have told you the truth, your grace. Had I known you would require proof I would have let Dedan bring you a sackful of thumbs. It took a full hour of arguing to drive the notion out of his head.\u201d\nThis didn\u2019t set the Maer back as I expected. \u201cPerhaps you should have let him,\u201d he said.\nThe humor of the situation was rapidly fading for me. \u201cYour grace, if I were to lie to you, I would choose a more convincing tale.\u201d I let him consider this for a moment. \u201cBesides, if all you want is proof, simply send someone out to verify it. We burned the bodies, but the skulls will still be there. I\u2019ll mark their camp for you on a map.\u201d", "The Maer took a different tack. \u201cWhat of this other part? Their leader. The man who didn\u2019t mind being shot through the leg? The one who stepped into his tent and \u2018disappeared\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cTrue, your grace.\u201d\nAlveron eyed me for a long moment, then sighed. \u201cThen I believe you,\u201d he said. \u201cBut still, it\u2019s strange and bitter news,\u201d he muttered, almost to himself.\n\u201cIndeed, your grace.\u201d\nHe gave me an oddly calculating look. \u201cWhat do you make of it?\u201d Before I could answer, there was the sound of a female voice from the\nouter rooms. Alveron\u2019s scowl vanished and he sat up straighter in his chair. I hid a smile behind my hand.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Meluan,\u201d Alveron said. \u201cIf I am correct, she is bringing us the question I mentioned earlier.\u201d He gave me a sly smile. \u201cI think you will enjoy it, a puzzling thing indeed.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-NINE": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-NINE\nLockless\nSTAPES ESCORTED MELUAN INTO the room while Alveron and I rose to our feet. She was dressed in grey and lavender, and her curling chestnut hair was pulled back to reveal her elegant neck.\nMeluan was followed by two serving boys carrying a wooden chest. The Maer moved to take his wife\u2019s elbow, while Stapes directed the boys to set the chest to one side of her chair. Alveron\u2019s manservant hurried them outside and gave me a conspiratorial wink before he closed the door behind himself.\nStill standing, I turned to Meluan and made my bows. \u201cI am pleased to have the chance to meet with you again . . . my lady?\u201d I made the last a question as I wasn\u2019t sure how to address her. The Lackless lands used to be a full earldom, but that was before the bloodless rebellion, when they still controlled Tinu\u00eb. Her marriage to the Alveron complicated things too, as I wasn\u2019t sure if there was a female counterpart to the title of Maershon.\nMeluan waved her hand easily, dismissing the issue entirely. \u201cLady is well enough between us two, at least when we are closeted. I\u2019ve no need for formality from one to whom I owe so great a debt.\u201d She took hold of Alveron\u2019s hand. \u201cPlease sit if you\u2019ve a mind.\u201d\nI made another bow and took my seat, eyeing the chest as casually as possible. It was about the size of a large drum, made of well-jointed birch and bound in brass.\nI knew the proper thing to do was engage in polite small talk until the matter of the chest was broached by one of the two of them. However, my curiosity got the better of me. \u201cI was told you were bringing a question with you. It must be a weighty one for you to keep it so tightly bound.\u201d I made a nod toward the chest.\nMeluan looked at Alveron and laughed as if he had told a joke. \u201cMy husband said you weren\u2019t the type to let a puzzle sit for very long.\u201d\nI gave a slightly shamefaced smile. \u201cIt goes against my nature, lady.\u201d \u201cI would not have you battle your nature on my account.\u201d She smiled.", "\u201cWould you be so good as to bring it round in front of me?\u201d\nI managed to lift the chest without hurting myself, but if it weighed less\nthan ten stone then I\u2019m a poet.\nMeluan sat forward in her chair, leaning over the chest. \u201cLerand has told\nme of the part you played in bringing us together. For that, my thanks. I hold myself in debt to you.\u201d Her dark brown eyes were gravely serious. \u201cHowever, I also consider the greater piece of that debt repaid by what I am about to show you. I can count on both hands the people who have seen this. Debt or no, I would never have considered showing you had not my husband vouchsafed me your full discretion.\u201d She gave me a pointed look.\n\u201cBy my hand, I will not speak of what I see to anyone,\u201d I assured her, trying not to seem as eager as I was.\nMeluan nodded. Then, rather than drawing out a key as I\u2019d expected, she pressed her hands to the sides of the chest and slid two panels slightly. There was a soft click and the lid sprang slightly ajar.\nLockless, I thought to myself.\nThe open lid revealed another chest, smaller and flatter. It was the size of a bread box, and its flat brass lockplate held a keyhole that was not keyhole shaped, but a simple circle instead. Meluan drew something from a chain around her neck.\n\u201cMay I see that?\u201d I asked.\nMeluan seemed surprised. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cThat key. May I see it for a moment?\u201d\n\u201cGod\u2019s bother,\u201d Alveron exclaimed. \u201cWe haven\u2019t come to the interesting\nbit yet. I offer you the mystery of an age and you admire the wrapping paper!\u201d\nMeluan handed me the key, and I gave it a quick but thorough examination, turning it in my hands. \u201cI like to take my mysteries layer by layer,\u201d I explained.\n\u201cLike an onion?\u201d He snorted.\n\u201cLike a flower,\u201d I countered, handing the key back to Meluan. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nMeluan fit the key and opened the lid of the inner chest. She slid the chain back around her neck, tucked it underneath her clothes, and rearranged her clothes and hair, repairing any damage done to her appearance. This seemed to take an hour or so.\nFinally she reached forward and lifted something out of the chest with both", "hands. Holding it just out of my sight behind the open lid, she looked up at me and took a deep breath. \u201cThis has been . . .\u201d she began.\n\u201cJust let him see it, dear,\u201d Alveron interjected gently. \u201cI\u2019m curious to see what he thinks on his own.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cBesides, I fear the boy will have a fit if you keep him waiting any longer.\u201d\nReverently, Meluan handed me a piece of dark wood the size of a thick book. I took it with both hands.\nThe box was unnaturally heavy for its size, the wood of it smooth as polished stone under my fingers. As I ran my hands over it, I found the sides were carved. Not dramatically enough to attract the attention of the eyes, but so subtly my fingers could barely feel a gentle pattern of risings and fallings in the wood. I brushed my hands over the top and felt a similar pattern.\n\u201cYou were right,\u201d Meluan said softly. \u201cHe\u2019s like a child with a midwinter\u2019s gift.\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen the best of it yet,\u201d Alveron replied. \u201cWait until he starts. The boy has a mind like an iron hammer.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you open it?\u201d I asked. I turned it in my hands and felt something shift inside. There were no obvious hinges or lid, not even a seam where a lid might be. It looked for all the world like a single piece of dark and weighty wood. But I knew it was a box of some sort. It felt like a box. It wanted to be opened.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Meluan said. She might have continued, but her husband hushed her gently.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s inside?\u201d I tilted it again, feeling the contents shift.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d she repeated.\nThe wood itself was interesting. It was dark enough to be roah, but it had a\ndeep red grain. What\u2019s more, it seemed to be a spicewood. It smelled faintly of . . . something.A familiar smell I couldn\u2019t quite put my finger on. I lowered my face to its surface and breathed in deeply through my nose, something almost like lemon. It was maddeningly familiar. \u201cWhat sort of wood is this?\u201d\nTheir silence was answer enough.\nI looked up and met their eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t give a body much to work with, do you?\u201d I smiled to soften any offense the words might bring.\nAlveron sat forward in his chair. \u201cYou must admit,\u201d he said with thinly veiled excitement, \u201cthis is a most excellent question. You\u2019ve shown me your gift at guessing before.\u201d His eyes glittered grey. \u201cSo what can you guess", "about this?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s an heirloom,\u201d I said easily. \u201cVery old\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHow old would you think?\u201d Alveron interjected hungrily.\n\u201cPerhaps three thousand years,\u201d I said. \u201cGive or take.\u201d Meluan stiffened in\nsurprise. \u201cI am close to your own guesses I take it?\u201d\nShe nodded mutely.\n\u201cThe carving has no doubt been eroded over the long years of handling.\u201d \u201cCarving?\u201d Alveron asked, leaning forward in his chair.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very faint,\u201d I said, closing my eyes. \u201cBut I can feel it.\u201d\n\u201cI felt no such thing.\u201d\n\u201cNor I,\u201d said Meluan. She seemed slightly offended.\n\u201cI have exceptionally sensitive hands,\u201d I said honestly. \u201cThey\u2019re necessary\nfor my work.\u201d\n\u201cYour magic?\u201d she asked with a well-hidden hint of childlike awe.\n\u201cAnd music,\u201d I said. \u201cIf you\u2019ll allow me?\u201d She nodded. So I took her hand\nin my own, and pressed it to the top of the box. \u201cThere. Can you feel it?\u201d She furrowed her forehead in concentration. \u201cPerhaps, just a bit.\u201d She took\nher hand away. \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s a carving?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s too regular to be an accident. How can it be you haven\u2019t noticed it\nbefore? Isn\u2019t it mentioned in any of your histories?\u201d\nMeluan was taken aback. \u201cNo one would think of writing down anything\nregarding the Loeclos Box. Haven\u2019t I said this is the most secret of secrets?\u201d \u201cShow me,\u201d Alveron said. I guided his fingers over the pattern. He\nfrowned. \u201cNothing. My fingers must be too old. Could it be letters?\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cIt\u2019s a flowing pattern, like scrollwork. But it doesn\u2019t\nrepeat, it changes . . .\u201d A thought struck me. \u201cIt might be a Yllish story knot.\u201d \u201cCan you read it?\u201d Alveron asked.\nI ran my fingers over it. \u201cI don\u2019t know enough Yllish to read a simple knot\nif I had the string between my fingers.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cBesides, the knots would have changed in the last three thousand years. I know a few people who might be able to translate it at the University.\u201d\nAlveron looked to Meluan, but she shook her head firmly.\u201cI will not have this spoken of to strangers.\u201d\nThe Maer seemed disappointed by this answer, but didn\u2019t press the point. Instead he turned back to me. \u201cLet me ask you your own questions back again. What sort of wood is it?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s lasted three thousand years,\u201d I mused aloud. \u201cIt\u2019s heavy despite being", "hollow. So it has to be a slow wood, like hornbeam or rennel. Its color and weight make me think it has a good deal of metal in it too, like roah. Probably iron and copper.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s the best I can do.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s inside it?\u201d\nI thought for a long moment before saying anything. \u201cSomething smaller than a saltbox. . . .\u201d I began. Meluan smiled, but Alveron gave the barest of frowns so I hurried on. \u201cSomething metal, by the way the weight shifts when I tilt it.\u201d I closed my eyes and listened to the padded thump of its contents moving in the box. \u201cNo. By the weight of it, perhaps something made of glass or stone.\u201d\n\u201cSomething precious,\u201d Alveron said.\nI opened my eyes. \u201cNot necessarily. It has become precious because it is old, and because it has been with a family for so long. It is also precious because it is a mystery. But was it precious to begin with?\u201d I shrugged. \u201cWho can say?\u201d\n\u201cBut you lock up precious things,\u201d Alveron pointed out.\n\u201cPrecisely.\u201d I held up the box, displaying its smooth face. \u201cThis isn\u2019t locked up. In fact, it might be locked away. It may be something dangerous.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d Alveron asked curiously.\n\u201cWhy go through this trouble?\u201d Meluan protested. \u201cWhy save something dangerous? If something is dangerous, you destroy it.\u201d She seemed to answer her own question as soon as she had voiced it. \u201cUnless it was precious as well as dangerous.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps it was too useful to destroy,\u201d Alveron suggested.\n\u201cPerhaps it couldn\u2019t be destroyed,\u201d I said.\n\u201cLast and best,\u201d Alveron said, leaning forward even further in his seat.\n\u201cHow do you open it?\u201d\nI gave the box a long look, turned it in my hands, pressed the sides. I ran\nmy fingers over the patterns, feeling for a seam my eyes could not detect. I shook it gently, tasted the air around it, held it to the light.\n\u201cI have no idea,\u201d I admitted.\nAlveron slumped a little. \u201cIt was too much to expect, I suppose. Perhaps some piece of magic?\u201d\nI hesitated to tell him that sort of magic only existed in stories. \u201cNone I have at my command.\u201d\n\u201cHave you ever considered simply cutting it open?\u201d Alveron asked his wife.", "Meluan looked every bit as horrified as I felt at the suggestion. \u201cNever!\u201d She said as soon as she caught her breath. \u201cIt is the very root of our family. I would sooner think of salting every acre of our lands.\u201d\n\u201cAnd hard as this wood is,\u201d I hurried to say, \u201cyou would most likely ruin whatever was inside. Especially if it is delicate.\u201d\n\u201cIt was only a thought.\u201d Alveron reassured his wife.\n\u201cAn ill-considered one,\u201d Meluan said sharply, then seemed to regret her words. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but the very thought ...\u201d She trailed off, obviously distraught.\nHe patted her hand. \u201cI understand, my dear. You\u2019re right, it was ill- considered.\u201d\n\u201cMight I put it away now?\u201d Meluan asked him.\nI reluctantly handed the box back to Meluan. \u201cIf there were a lock I could attempt to circumvent it, but I can\u2019t even make a guess at where the hinge might be, or the seam for the lid.\u201d In a box, no lid or locks/ Lackless keeps her husband\u2019s rocks. The child\u2019s skipping rhyme ran madly through my head and I only barely managed to turn my laugh into a cough.\nAlveron didn\u2019t seem to notice. \u201cAs always, I trust to your discretion.\u201d He got to his feet. \u201cUnfortunately, I fear I have used up the better portion of our time. I\u2019m certain you have other matters to attend to. Shall we meet tomorrow to discuss the Amyr? Second bell?\u201d\nI had risen to my feet with the Maer. \u201cIf it please your grace, I have another matter that warrants some discussion.\u201d\nHe gave me a serious look. \u201cI trust this is an important matter.\u201d\n\u201cMost urgent, your grace,\u201d I said nervously. \u201cIt should not wait another day. I would have mentioned it sooner, had we both privacy and time.\u201d\n\u201cVery well,\u201d he sat back down. \u201cWhat presses you so direly?\u201d\n\u201cLerand,\u201d Meluan said with slight reproach. \u201cIt is past the hour. Hayanis will be waiting.\u201d\n\u201cLet him wait,\u201d he said. \u201cKvothe has served me well in all regards. He does nothing lightly, and I ignore him only to my detriment.\u201d\n\u201cYou flatter me, your grace. This matter is a grave one.\u201d I glanced at Meluan. \u201cAnd somewhat delicate as well. If your lady desires to leave, it might be for the best.\u201d\n\u201cIf the matter is important, should I not stay?\u201d she asked archly.\nI gave the Maer a questioning look.\n\u201cAnything you wish to say to me you can tell my lady wife,\u201d he said.", "I hesitated. I needed to tell Alveron about the false troupers soon. I was sure if he heard my version of events first, I could present them in a way that cast me in a favorable light. If word came through official channels first he might not be willing to overlook the bald facts of the situation, that I had slaughtered nine travelers of my own free will.\nDespite that, the last thing I wanted was Meluan present for the conversation. It couldn\u2019t help but complicate the situation. I tried one final time. \u201cIt is a matter most dark, your grace.\u201d\nAlveron shook his head, frowning slightly. \u201cWe have no secrets.\u201d\nI fought down a resigned sigh and drew a thick piece of folded parchment from an inner pocket of my shaed. \u201cIs this one of the writs of patronage your grace has granted?\u201d\nHis grey eyes flickered over it, showing some surprise. \u201cYes. How did you come by it?\u201d\n\u201cOh, Lerand,\u201d Meluan said. \u201cI knew you let the beggars travel in your lands, but I never thought you would stoop to patronizing them as well.\u201d\n\u201cOnly a handful of troupes,\u201d he said. \u201cAs befitting my rank. Every respectable household has at least a few players.\u201d\n\u201cMine,\u201d Meluan said firmly, \u201cdoes not.\u201d\n\u201cIt is convenient to have one\u2019s own troupe,\u201d Alveron said gently. \u201cAnd more convenient to have several. Then one can choose the proper entertainment to accompany whatever event you might be hosting. Where do you think the musicians at our wedding came from?\u201d\nWhen Meluan\u2019s expression did not soften, Alveron continued. \u201cThey\u2019re not permitted to perform anything bawdy or heathen, dear. I keep them under most close controlment. And rest assured, no town in my lands would let a troupe perform unless they had a noble\u2019s writ with them.\u201d\nAlveron turned back to me. \u201cWhich brings us back to the matter at hand. How did you come to have their writ? The troupe must be doing poorly without it.\u201d\nI hesitated. With Meluan here, I was unsure as to the best way to approach the subject. I\u2019d planned on speaking to the Maer alone. \u201cThey are, your grace. They were killed.\u201d\nThe Maer showed no surprise. \u201cI thought as much. Such things are unfortunate, but they happen from time to time.\u201d\nMeluan\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cI\u2019d give a great deal to see them happen more often.\u201d", "\u201cHave you any idea who killed them?\u201d the Maer asked. \u201cIn a certain manner of speaking, your grace.\u201d\nHe raised his eyebrows expectantly. \u201cWell then?\u201d\n\u201cI did.\u201d\n\u201cYou did what?\u201d\nI sighed. \u201cI killed the men carrying that writ, your grace.\u201d\nHe stiffened in his seat. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThey had kidnapped a pair of girls from a town they passed through.\u201d I\npaused, looking for a delicate way of saying it in front of Meluan. \u201cThey were young girls, your grace, and the men were not kind to them.\u201d\nMeluan\u2019s expression, already hard, grew cold as ice at this. But before she could speak, Alveron demanded incredulously, \u201cAnd you took it on yourself to kill them? An entire troupe of performers I had given license to?\u201d He rubbed his forehead. \u201cHow many were there?\u201d\n\u201cNine.\u201d\n\u201cGood lord . . .\u201d\n\u201cI think he did right,\u201d Meluan said hotly. \u201cI say you give him a score of\nguards and let him do the same to every ravel band of Ruh he finds within your lands.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear,\u201d Alveron said with a touch of sternness. \u201cI don\u2019t care for them much more than you, but law is law. When . . .\u201d\n\u201cLaw is what you make it,\u201d she interjected. \u201cThis man has done you a noble service. You should grant him fief and title and set him on your council.\u201d\n\u201cHe killed nine of my subjects,\u201d Alveron pointed out sternly. \u201cWhen men step outside the rule of law, anarchy results. If I heard of this in passing, I would hang him for a bandit.\u201d\n\u201cHe killed nine Ruh rapists. Nine murdering ravel thieves. Nine fewer Edema men in the world is a service to us all.\u201d Meluan looked at me. \u201cSir. I think you did nothing but what was right and proper.\u201d\nHer misdirected praise did nothing but fan the fire beneath my temper. \u201cNot all of them were men, my lady,\u201d I said to her.\nMeluan paled a bit at that remark.\nAlveron rubbed his face with a hand. \u201cGood lord, man. Your honesty is like a felling axe.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I should mention,\u201d I said seriously, \u201cbegging both your pardons, that those I killed were not Edema Ruh. They were not even a real troupe.\u201d", "Alveron shook his head tiredly and tapped the writ in front of him. \u201cIt says here otherwise. Edema Ruh and troupers both.\u201d\n\u201cThe writ was stolen goods, your grace. The folk I met on the road had killed a troupe of Ruh and taken up their place.\u201d\nHe gave me a curious look. \u201cYou seem rather certain of it.\u201d\n\u201cOne of them told me so, your grace. He admitted they were merely impersonating a troupe. They were pretending to be Ruh.\u201d\nMeluan looked as if she couldn\u2019t decide whether she was confused or sickened by the thought. \u201cWho would pretend such a thing?\u201d\nAlveron nodded. \u201cMy wife makes a point,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems more likely that they lied to you. Who wouldn\u2019t deny such a thing? Who would willingly admit to being one of the Edema Ruh?\u201d\nI felt myself flush hot at this, suddenly ashamed that I had concealed my Edema Ruh blood for all this time. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt your original troupe were Edema Ruh, your grace. But the men I killed were not. No Ruh would do the things they did.\u201d\nMeluan\u2019s eyes flashed furiously. \u201cYou do not know them.\u201d\nI met her eyes. \u201cMy lady, I think I know them rather well.\u201d\n\u201cBut why?\u201d Alveron asked. \u201cWho in their right mind would try to pass\nthemselves off as Edema Ruh?\u201d\n\u201cFor ease of travel,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd the protection your name offers.\u201d\nHe shrugged my explanation away. \u201cThey were probably Ruh that tired of\nhonest work and took up thieving instead.\u201d\n\u201cNo, your grace,\u201d I insisted. \u201cThey were not Edema Ruh.\u201d Alveron gave me a reproachful look. \u201cCome now. Who can tell the\ndifference between bandits and a band of Ruh?\u201d\n\u201cThere is no difference,\u201d Meluan said crisply.\n\u201cYour grace, I would know the difference,\u201d I said hotly. \u201cI am Edema\nRuh.\u201d\nSilence. Meluan\u2019s expression turned from blank shock, to disbelief, to\nrage, to disgust. She came to her feet, looked for a moment as if she would spit on me, then walked stiffly out the door. There was a clatter as her personal guard came to attention and followed her out of the outer rooms.\nAlveron continued to look at me, his face severe. \u201cIf this is a joke, it is a poor one.\u201d\n\u201cIt is none, your grace,\u201d I said, wrestling with my temper. \u201cAnd why have you found it necessary to hide this from me?\u201d", "\u201cI have not hidden it, your grace. You yourself have mentioned several times that I am far from gentle birth.\u201d\nHe struck the arm of his chair angrily. \u201cYou know what I mean! Why did you never mention that you are one of the Ruh?\u201d\n\u201cI think the reason rather obvious, your grace,\u201d I said stiffly, trying to keep from spitting out the words. \u201cThe words \u2018Edema Ruh\u2019 have too strong a smell for many gentle noses.Your wife has found her perfume cannot cover it.\u201d\n\u201cMy lady has had unfortunate dealings with the Ruh in the past,\u201d he said by way of explanation. \u201cYou would do well to note.\u201d\n\u201cI know of her sister. Her family\u2019s tragic shame. Run off and love a trouper. How terrible,\u201d I said scathingly, my entire body prickling with hot rage. \u201cHer sister\u2019s sense does credit to her family; less so the actions of your lady wife. My blood is worth as much as any man\u2019s, and more than most. And even were it not, she has no leave to treat me as she did.\u201d\nAlveron\u2019s expression hardened. \u201cI rather think that she has leave to treat you as she will,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was simply startled by your sudden proclamation. Given her feelings about you ravel, I think she showed remarkable restraint.\u201d\n\u201cI think she rues the truth. A trouper\u2019s tongue has gotten her to bed more quickly than her sister.\u201d\nAs soon as I said it, I knew I had gone too far. I clenched my teeth to keep from saying anything worse.\n\u201cThat will be all,\u201d Alveron said with cold formality, his eyes flat and angry.\nI left with all the angry dignity I could muster. Not because I had nothing else to say, but because if I had stayed one moment longer he would have called for guards, and that is not how I wished to make my exit.", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY\nJust Rewards\nI WAS IN THE MIDDLE of dressing the following morning when an errand boy arrived bearing a thick envelope with Alveron\u2019s seal. I took a seat by the window and discovered several letters inside. The outermost one read:\nKvothe,\nI have thought a while and decided your blood matters but little in\nlight of the services you have rendered me.\nHowever, my soul is bound to another whose comfort I hold more\ndearly than my own. Though I had hoped to retain your services, I cannot. What\u2019s more, as your presence is the cause of my wife\u2019s considerable distress, I must ask you to return my ring and leave Severen at your earliest convenience.\nI stopped reading, got to my feet, and opened the door to my rooms. A pair of Alveron\u2019s guards were standing at attention in the hallway.\n\u201cSir?\u201d one of them said, eyeing my half-dressed state. \u201cJust checking,\u201d I said, closing the door.\nI returned to my seat and picked up the letter again.\nAs to the matter that precipitated this unfortunate circumstance, I believe you have acted in the best interest of myself and Vintas as a whole. In fact, I have received report just this morning that two girls were returned to their families in Levinshir by a red-haired \u201cgentleman\u201d named Kvothe.\nAs reward for your many services I offer the following:\nFirst, a full pardon for those you killed near Levinshir.\nSecond, a letter of credit enabling you to draw on my coffers for the\npayment of your tuition at the University.\nThird, a writ granting you the right to travel, play, and perform", "wherever you will within my lands. Lastly, my thanks.\nMaershon Lerand Alveron\nI sat for a few long minutes, watching the birds flit in the garden outside my window. The contents of the envelope were just as Alveron had said. The letter of credit was a work of art, signed and sealed in four places by Alveron and his chief exchequer.\nThe writ was, if anything, even more lovely. It was drawn on a thick sheet of creamy vellum, signed by the Maer\u2019s own hand and fixed with both his family\u2019s seal and that of Alveron himself.\nBut it was not a writ of patronage. I read through it carefully. By omission it made it clear that neither was I in the Maer\u2019s service, nor were we bound to each other. Still, it granted free travel and the right to perform under his name. It was an odd compromise of a document.\nI\u2019d just finished dressing when there came another knock on the door. I sighed, half expecting more guards coming to roust me out of my rooms.\nBut opening the door revealed another runner boy. He carried a silver tray bearing another letter. This one had the Lackless seal upon the top. Beside it lay a ring. I picked it up and turned it over in my hands, puzzled. It wasn\u2019t iron, as I\u2019d expected, but pale wood. Meluan\u2019s name was burned crudely into the side of it.\nI noticed the runner boy\u2019s wide eyes darting back and forth between the ring and myself. More importantly, I noticed the guards were not staring at it. Pointedly not staring. The sort of not-staring you only engage in when something very interesting has come to your attention.\nI handed the boy my silver ring. \u201cTake this to Bredon,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t dawdle.\u201d\nBredon was looking up at the guards as I opened the door. \u201cKeep up the good work, my boys,\u201d he said, playfully tapping one of them on the chest with his walking stick. The silver wolf\u2019 s head chimed lightly against the guard\u2019s breastplate, and Bredon smiled like a jolly uncle. \u201cWe all feel safer for your vigilance.\u201d\n \nHe closed the door behind himself and raised an eyebrow at me. \u201cLord\u2019s mercy boy, you\u2019re up the ladder by leaps and bounds. I knew you sat solid in the Maer\u2019s good grace, but to have him assign you two of his personal guard?\u201d He pressed his hand to his heart and sighed dramatically. \u201cSoon you will be too busy for the likes of poor old useless Bredon.\u201d\nI gave him a weak smile. \u201cI think it\u2019s more complicated than that.\u201d I held up the wooden ring for him to see. \u201cI need you to tell me what this means.\u201d\nBredon\u2019s jovial cheer evaporated more quickly than if I\u2019d pulled out a bloody knife. \u201cLord and lady,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me you got that from some oldfashioned farmer.\u201d\nI shook my head and handed it to him.\nHe turned the ring over in his hands. \u201cMeluan?\u201d he asked quietly. Handing it back, he sank into a nearby chair, his walking stick across his knees. His face had gone slightly grey. \u201cThe Maer\u2019s new lady wife sent you this? As a summons?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s about as far from a summons as anything can be,\u201d I said. \u201cShe sent a charming letter, too.\u201d I held it up with my other hand.\nBredon held out his hand. \u201cCan I see it?\u201d he asked, then drew his hand back quickly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s terribly rude of me to ask\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou could do me no greater favor than reading it,\u201d I said, pressing it into his hands. \u201cI am in desperate need of your opinion.\u201d\nBredon took the letter and began to read, his lips moving slightly. His expression grew paler as he made his way down the page.\n\u201cThe lady has a gift for well-turned phrase,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThat cannot be denied,\u201d he said. \u201cShe might as well have written this in blood.\u201d\n\u201cI think she would have liked to,\u201d I said. \u201cBut she would have had to kill herself to fill the second page.\u201d I held it out to him.\nBredon took it and continued to read, his face growing even paler. \u201cGods all around us,\u201d he said. \u201cIs \u2018excrescence\u2019 even a word?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cIt is,\u201d I said.\nBredon finished the second page, then went back to the beginning and slowly read it through a second time. Finally he looked up at me. \u201cIf there were a woman,\u201d he said, \u201cwho loved me with one-tenth the passion this lady feels for you, I would count myself the luckiest of men.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d I asked, holding up the ring. I could smell smoke on it. She must have burned her name into it just this morning.", "\u201cFrom a farmer?\u201d he shrugged. \u201cMany things, depending on the wood. But here? From one of the nobility?\u201d He shook his head, obviously at a loss for words.\n\u201cI thought there were only three types of courtly rings,\u201d I said.\n\u201cOnly three a person would use,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly three that are sent and displayed. It used to be you sent wooden rings to summon servants. Those too low for iron. But that was a long while back. Eventually it became a terrible snub to send someone in the court a wooden ring.\u201d\n\u201cA snub I can live with,\u201d I said, relieved. \u201cI\u2019ve been snubbed by better folk than her.\u201d\n\u201cThat was a hundred years ago,\u201d Bredon said. \u201cThings have changed. The problem was, once the wooden rings were seen as a snub, some servants would be offended by them. You don\u2019t want to offend the master of your stables, so you don\u2019t send him a wooden ring. But if he doesn\u2019t get a wooden ring, then your tailor might be offended by one.\u201d\nI nodded my understanding. \u201cAnd so on. Eventually anyone was offended by a wooden ring.\u201d\nBredon nodded. \u201cA wise man is careful to stay on the good side of his servants,\u201d he said. \u201cEven the boy that brings your dinner can carry a grudge, and there are a thousand invisible revenges available to the lowest of them. Wooden rings aren\u2019t used at all anymore. They probably would have fallen out of memory entirely if they weren\u2019t used as a plot device in a handful of plays.\u201d\nI looked at the ring. \u201cSo I\u2019m lower than the boy who collects the slops.\u201d\nBredon cleared his throat self-consciously. \u201cMore than that, actually.\u201d He pointed. \u201cThat means to her, you aren\u2019t even a person. You aren\u2019t worth recognizing as a human being.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d I said. \u201cI see.\u201d\nI slid the wooden ring onto my finger and made a fist. It was quite a good fit, actually.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the sort of ring you wear,\u201d Bredon said uncomfortably. \u201cIt\u2019s quite the other sort of ring, actually.\u201d He gave me a curious look. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you still have Alveron\u2019s ring?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s asked for it back, actually.\u201d I picked the Maer\u2019s letter off the table and handed it to Bredon as well.\n\u201cAt your earliest convenience,\u201d Bredon quoted with a dry chuckle. \u201cThat says quite a bit more than it seems.\u201d He set the letter down. \u201cStill, it\u2019s", "probably better this way. If he left you with his favor you\u2019d be a battleground for them: a peppercorn between her mortar and his pestle. They would crush you with their bickering.\u201d\nHis eyes flickered back to the wooden ring on my hand. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose she gave it to you personally?\u201d he asked hopefully.\n\u201cShe sent it with a runner.\u201d I let out a low sigh. \u201cThe guards saw it too.\u201d\nThere was a knock on the door. I answered it, and a runner boy handed me a letter.\nI closed the door and looked at the seal. \u201cLord Praevek,\u201d I said.\nBredon shook his head. \u201cI swear that man spends every waking moment with his ear against a keyhole or his tongue up someone\u2019s ass.\u201d\nChuckling, I cracked the letter open and scanned it quickly. \u201cHe\u2019s asking for his ring back,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s smudged too, he didn\u2019t even wait for the ink to dry.\u201d\nBredon nodded. \u201cWord is undoubtedly spreading. It wouldn\u2019t be so bad if she wasn\u2019t sitting strong at Alveron\u2019s right hand. But she is, and she\u2019s made her opinion clear. Anyone who treats you better than a dog will doubtless share the scorn she feels for you.\u201d He fluttered her letter. \u201cAnd scorn such as this, there\u2019s plenty to go around without worry of it spreading thin.\u201d\nBredon gestured to the bowl of rings and gave a dry, mirthless chuckle. \u201cJust when you were getting some silver, too.\u201d\nI walked over to the bowl, dug out his ring, and held it out to him. \u201cYou should take this back,\u201d I said.\nBredon\u2019s expression looked pained, but he made no move to take the ring.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be leaving soon,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d hate for you to be tarnished by your contact with me. There\u2019s no way I can thank you for the help you\u2019ve given me. The least I can do is help minimize the damage to your reputation.\u201d\nBredon hesitated, then closed his eyes and sighed. He took the ring with a defeated shrug.\n\u201cOh,\u201d I said, suddenly remembering something else. I went to the stack of slanderous stories and pulled out the pages that described his pagan frolics. \u201cYou might find this amusing,\u201d I said as I handed it to him. \u201cNow you should probably go. Simply being here can\u2019t be good for you.\u201d\nBredon sighed and nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry it didn\u2019t work out better for you, my boy. If you\u2019re ever back in these parts don\u2019t hesitate to call on me. These things do blow over eventually.\u201d His eyes kept drifting back to the wooden", "ring on my finger. \u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t keep wearing that.\u201d\nAfter he was gone, I fished Stapes\u2019 gold ring out of the bowl and Alveron\u2019s\niron one as well. Then I stepped out into the hallway.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to pay a call on Stapes,\u201d I said politely to the guards. \u201cWould\nthe two of you care to accompany me?\u201d\nThe taller one glanced at the ring on my finger, then looked at his\ncompanion before murmuring an agreement. I turned on my heel and set off, my escort keeping pace behind me.\nStapes ushered me inside his sitting room and closed the door behind me. His rooms were even finer than my own and considerably more lived in. I also saw a large bowl of rings on a nearby table. All of them were gold. The only iron ring in sight was Alveron\u2019s, and that was on his finger.\nHe might look like a grocer, but Stapes had a sharp set of eyes. He spotted the ring on my finger straightaway. \u201cShe did it then,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t wear it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of what I am,\u201d I said. \u201cIf this is the ring of an Edema Ruh, I\u2019ll wear it.\u201d\nStapes sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than that.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d I said.\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to make your life difficult. Could you return this to the Maer for me?\u201d I handed him Alveron\u2019s ring.\nStapes put it in his pocket.\n\u201cI also wanted to return these.\u201d I handed him the two rings he had given me. One bright gold, one white bone. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make trouble between you and your master\u2019s new wife.\u201d\nStapes nodded, holding up the gold ring. \u201cIt would make trouble if you kept it,\u201d he said. \u201cI am in the Maer\u2019s service. As such, I need to be mindful of the games of the court.\u201d\nThen he reached out and took my hand, pressing the bone ring back into it. \u201cBut this lies outside my duty to the Maer. It is a debt between two men. The games of the court have no sway over such things.\u201d Stapes met my eye. \u201cAnd I insist you keep it.\u201d\n  \nI ate a late supper alone in my rooms. The guards were still waiting patiently outside as I read the Maer\u2019s letter for the fifth time. Each time I hoped to find some clement sentiment hidden in his phrasing. But it simply wasn\u2019t there.\nOn the table sat the various papers the Maer had sent. I emptied my purse beside them. I had two gold royals, four silver nobles, eight and a half pennies, and, inexplicably, a single Modegan strelum, though I couldn\u2019t for the life of me remember where I\u2019d come by it.\nAltogether they equaled slightly less than eight talents. I stacked them next to Alveron\u2019s papers. Eight talents, a pardon, a player\u2019s writ, and my tuition paid at the University. It was not an inconsiderable reward.\nStill, I couldn\u2019t help but feel rather shorted. I had saved Alveron from a poisoning, uncovered a traitor in his court, won him a wife, and rid his roads of more dangerous folk than I cared to count.\nDespite all that, I was still left without a patron. Worse, his letter had made no mention of the Amyr, no mention of the support he had promised to lend me in my search for them.\nBut there was nothing to be gained by making a fuss, and much that I could lose. I refilled my purse and tucked Alveron\u2019s letters into the secret compartment in my lute case.\nI also nicked three books I\u2019d brought from Caudicus\u2019 library, since no one knew I had them, and tipped the bowlful of rings into a small sack. The wardrobe held two dozen finely tailored outfits. They were worth a heavy penny, but weren\u2019t very portable. I took two of the nicer outfits and left the rest hanging.\nLastly I belted on Caesura and worked my shaed into a long cape. Those two items reassured me that my time in Vintas had not been entirely wasted, though I\u2019d earned them on my own, not through any help of Alveron\u2019s.\nI locked the door, snuffed the lamps, and climbed out a window into the garden. Then I used a piece of bent wire to lock the window and close the shutters behind me.\nPetty mischief? Perhaps, but I\u2019d be damned if I\u2019d be escorted from the estates by the Maer\u2019s guard. Besides, the thought of them puzzling over my escape made me chuckle, and laughter is good for the digestion.\n \nI made my way out of the estates without anyone seeing me. My shaed was well suited to sneaking about in the dark. After an hour of searching I found a greasy bookbinder in Severen-Low.\nHe was an unsavory fellow with the morals of a feral dog, but he was interested in the stack of slanderous stories the nobility had been sending to my rooms. He offered me four reels for the lot of them, plus the promise of ten pennies for every volume of the book he sold after they were printed. I bargained him up to six reels and six pennies per copy and we shook hands. I left his shop, burned the contract, and washed my hands twice. I did keep the money, however.\nAfter that I sold both suits of fine clothing and all of Caudicus\u2019 books except for one. With the money I\u2019d accumulated, I spent the next several hours on the docks and found a ship leaving the next day for Junpui.\nAs night settled onto the city, I wandered the high parts of Severen, hoping I might run into Denna. I didn\u2019t, of course. I could tell she was long gone. A city feels different when Denna is somewhere inside it, and Severen felt as hollow as an empty egg.\nAt the end of several hours of fruitless searching, I stopped by a dockside brothel and spent some time drinking in the taproom. It was a slow night, and the ladies were bored. So I bought drinks for everyone, and we talked. I told a few stories and they listened. I played a few songs and they applauded. Then I asked a favor, and they laughed and laughed and laughed.\nSo I poured the sackful of rings into a bowl and left them on the bar. Soon the ladies were trying them on and arguing over who would get the silver ones. I bought another round of drinks and left, my mood somewhat improved.\nI wandered aimlessly after that, eventually finding a small public garden near the lip of the Sheer looking out over Severen-Low. The lamps below were burning orange, while here or there a gaslight or sympathy lamp flickered greenish blue and crimson. It was as breathtaking as the first time I had seen it.\nI had been watching for some time before I realized I wasn\u2019t alone. An older man leaned against a tree several feet away, looking down at the lights much as I had been. A faint and not unpleasant aroma of beer wafted from him.", "\u201cShe\u2019s a pretty thing, innit she?\u201d he said, his accent marking him as a dockworker.\nI agreed. We watched the twinkling fires silently for a time. I unscrewed the wooden ring from my finger and considered throwing it off the cliff. Now that someone was watching, I couldn\u2019t help but feel the gesture was somewhat childish.\n\u201cThey say a nobleman can piss on half o\u2019 Severen from up here,\u201d the dockman said conversationally.\nI tucked the ring into a pocket of my shaed. A memento then. \u201cThose are the lazy ones,\u201d I replied. \u201cThe ones I\u2019ve met can piss a lot farther than that.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-ONE": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-ONE\nA Journey to Return\nFATE FAVORED ME ON the way back to the University. We had a good wind and everything was delightfully uneventful. The sailors had heard of my encounter with Felurian, so I enjoyed a modest fame for the duration of the trip. I played them the song I\u2019d written about it, and told them the story about half as often as they asked me to.\nI also told them about my trip to the Adem. They didn\u2019t believe a piece of it at first, but then I showed them the sword and threw their best wrestler three times. They showed me a different sort of respect after that, and a rougher, more honest sort of friendship.\nI learned a goodly bit from them on my journey home. They told me sea stories and the names of stars. They talked about wind and water and wimmin, sorry, women. They tried to teach me sailor\u2019s knots, but I didn\u2019t have a knack for it, though I proved to be a dab hand at untying them.\nAltogether it was very pleasant. The friendship of the sailors, the song of the wind in the rigging, the smell of sweat and salt and tar. Over the long days, these things slowly eased the bitterness I felt toward my ill treatment at the hands of Maer Alveron and his loving lady wife.", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-TWO": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-TWO\nHome\nEVENTUALLY WE DOCKED IN Tarbean, where the sailors helped me find a cheap berth on a billow boat heading upstream toward Anilin. I got off two days later in Imre and walked to the University just as the first blue light of dawn was coloring the sky.\nI\u2019ve never in my life had anything like a home. As a young child I grew up on the road, endlessly traveling with my troupe. Home wasn\u2019t a place. It was people and wagons. Later in Tarbean I had had a secret place where three roofs came together and gave me shelter from the rain. I slept there and hid a few precious things, but it wasn\u2019t anything like a home.\nBecause of this, I\u2019d never in my life enjoyed the feeling of coming home after a journey. I felt it for the first time that day as I crossed the Omethi, the stones of the bridge familiar underneath my feet. As I came to the tallest part of its broad arch I could see the grey shape of the Archives rising out of the trees ahead of me.\nThe streets of the University were comforting under my feet. I\u2019d been gone for three-quarters of a year. In some ways it seemed much longer, but at the same time everything here felt so familiar that it felt like hardly any time at all had passed.\nIt was still early when I got to Anker\u2019s, and the front door was locked. I briefly considered climbing up to my window, then thought better of it, given that I was carrying my lute case and travelsack, and wearing Caesura as well.\nInstead I made my way to the Mews and knocked on Simmon\u2019s door. It was early, and I knew I\u2019d be waking him, but I was hungry for a familiar face. After waiting a short minute and hearing nothing, I knocked again, louder, and practiced my best jaunty smile.\nSim opened the door, his hair in disarray, his eyes red from too little sleep. He looked blearily out at me. For the space of a breath his expression was blank, then he hurled himself at me with a crushing hug.\n\u201cBlackened body of God,\u201d he said, using stronger language than I\u2019d ever", "heard from him before. \u201cKvothe.You\u2019re alive.\u201d\nSim had a bit of a cry, then shouted at me for a while, and then we laughed and sorted matters out. It seems Threpe had been keeping closer tabs on my travels than I\u2019d thought. Consequently, when my ship had gone missing, he\u2019d assumed the worst.\nA letter would have cleared things up, but I\u2019d never thought to send one. The thought of writing home was utterly alien to me.\n\u201cThe ship was reported as all hands lost,\u201d Sim said. \u201cWord spread around the Eolian and guess who heard the news.\u201d\n\u201cStanchion?\u201d I asked, knowing he was a terrible gossip.\nSim shook his head grimly. \u201cAmbrose.\u201d\n\u201cOh lovely,\u201d I observed dryly.\n\u201cIt would have been bad coming from anyone,\u201d Sim said. \u201cBut it was\nworst from him. I was half convinced he\u2019d somehow arranged to sink your ship.\u201d He gave a sickly smile. \u201cHe waited until right before admissions before he broke the news to me. Needless to say, I pissed all over myself during my exam and spent another term as an E\u2019lir.\u201d\n\u201cSpent?\u201d I said. \u201cYou made Re\u2019lar?\u201d\nHe grinned. \u201cJust yesterday. I was sleeping off the celebration when you woke me up this morning.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019s Wil?\u201d I asked. \u201cDid he take the news hard?\u201d\n\u201cEven-keeled as always,\u201d Sim said. \u201cBut for all that, yeah, pretty hard.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cAmbrose has been making his life difficult in the Archives, too. Wil got fed up with it and went home for a term. He should be back today.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019s everyone else?\u201d I asked.\nA thought seemed to strike Sim all of a sudden. He stood up. \u201cOh God, Fela!\u201d Then he sat down hard, as if his legs had been cut from underneath him. \u201cOh God, Fela,\u201d he said in a completely different tone.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked. \u201cDid something happen to her?\u201d\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t take the news well either.\u201d He gave me a shaky smile. \u201cIt turns out she had quite a thing for you.\u201d\n\u201cFela?\u201d I said stupidly.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you remember? Wil and I thought she liked you?\u201d\n \nIt seemed like years ago. \u201cI remember.\u201d\nSim seemed uncomfortable. \u201cWell, you see. While you were gone, Wil and I started spending a lot of time with her. And . . .\u201d He made an inarticulate gesture, his expression was stuck between sheepish and grinning.\nRealization struck. \u201cYou and Fela? Sim, that\u2019s great!\u201d I felt a grin spread across my face, then saw his expression. \u201cOh.\u201d My grin fell away. \u201cSim, I wouldn\u2019t get in the way of that.\u201d\n\u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d He smiled a sickly smile. \u201cI trust you.\u201d\nI rubbed my eyes. \u201cThis is a hell of a homecoming. I haven\u2019t even been through admissions yet.\u201d\n\u201cToday\u2019s the last day,\u201d Sim pointed out.\n\u201cI know,\u201d I said, getting to my feet. \u201cI have an errand to run first.\u201d\nI left my baggage in Simmon\u2019s room and paid a visit to the bursar in the basement of Hollows. Riem was a balding, pinch-faced man who had disliked me ever since the masters had assigned me a negative tuition in my first term. He wasn\u2019t in the habit of giving money out, and the entire experience had rubbed him the wrong way.\nI showed him my open letter of credit to Alveron\u2019s coffers. As I\u2019ve said, it was an impressive document. Signed by the Maer\u2019s own hand. Wax seals. Fine vellum. Excellent penmanship.\nI drew the bursar\u2019s attention to the fact that the Maer\u2019s letter would allow the University to draw any amount needed to cover my tuition. Any amount.\nThe bursar read it over and agreed that that seemed to be the case.\nIt\u2019s too bad my tuition was always so low, I mused aloud. Never more than ten talents. It was a bit of a missed opportunity for the University. The Maer was richer than the King of Vint, after all. And he would pay any tuition. . . .\nRiem was a savvy man, and he understood what I was hinting at immediately. There followed a brief bout of negotiation, after which we shook hands and I saw him smile for the first time.\nI grabbed a bite of lunch, then waited in line with the rest of the students who didn\u2019t have admissions tiles. Most of them were new students, but a few were applying for readmission like myself. It was a long line, and everyone was visibly nervous to some degree. I whistled to pass the time and bought a\n \nmeat pie and a mug of hot cider from a man with a cart.\nI caused a bit of a stir when I stepped into the circle of light in front of the\nmasters\u2019 table. They had heard the news and were surprised to see me alive, most of them pleasantly so. Kilvin demanded I report to the workshop soon, while Mandrag, Dal, and Arwyl argued over which courses of study I would pursue. Elodin merely waved at me, the only one apparently unimpressed by my miraculous return from the dead.\nAfter a minute of congenial chaos, the Chancellor got things back under control and started my interview. I answered Dal\u2019s questions easily enough, and Kilvin\u2019s. But I fumbled my cipher with Brandeur, then had to admit I simply didn\u2019t know the answer to Mandrag\u2019s question about sublimation.\nElodin shrugged away his opportunity to question me, yawning hugely. Lorren asked a surprisingly easy question about the Mender heresies, and I managed a quick and clever answer for him. I had to think for a long moment before answering Arwyl\u2019s question about lacillium.\nThat left only Hemme, who had been scowling furiously since I\u2019d first stepped up to the masters\u2019 table. My lackluster performance and slow answers had brought a smug curve to his lips by this point. His eyes gleamed whenever I gave a wrong answer.\n\u201cWell well,\u201d he said, shuffling through the sheaf of papers in front of him. \u201cI didn\u2019t think we\u2019d have to deal with your type of trouble again.\u201d He gave me an insincere smile. \u201cI\u2019d heard you were dead.\u201d\n\u201cI heard you wear a red lace corset,\u201d I said matter-of-factly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t believe every bit of nonsense that gets rumored about.\u201d\nSome shouting followed, and I was quickly brought up on charges of Improper Address of a Master. I was sentenced to compose a letter of apology and fined a single silver talent. Money well spent.\nIt was bad behavior though, and poorly timed, especially after my otherwise lackluster performance. As a result, I was assigned a tuition of twenty-four talents. Needless to say, I was terribly embarrassed.\nAfterward I returned to the bursar\u2019s office. I officially presented Alveron\u2019s letter of credit to Riem and unofficially collected my agreed-upon cut: half of everything over ten talents. I put the seven talents in my purse and wondered idly if anyone had ever been paid so well for insolence and ignorance.\nI headed to Anker\u2019s, where I was pleased to discover no one had informed the owner of my death. The key to my room was somewhere at the bottom of the Centhe Sea, but Anker had a spare. I went upstairs and felt myself relax at", "the familiar sight of the sloping ceiling and narrow bed. Everything was covered in a thin layer of dust.\nYou might think my tiny room with its sloped ceiling and narrow bed would feel cramped after my grand suite in Alveron\u2019s estate. But nothing could be further from the truth. I busied myself unpacking my travelsack and getting cobwebs out of corners.\nAfter an hour, I\u2019d managed to pick the lock on the trunk at the foot of my bed and unpack the things I\u2019d stored away. I rediscovered my half-dismantled harmony clock and tinkered with it idly, trying to remember whether I\u2019d been in the middle of taking it apart or putting it back together.\nThen, since I had no other pressing engagements, I made my way back across the river. I stopped at the Eolian, where Deoch greeted me with an enthusiastic bear hug that lifted me from the ground. After so long on the road, so much time spent among strangers and enemies, I\u2019d forgotten what it was like to be surrounded by the warmth of friendly faces. Deoch, Stanchion, and I shared drinks and traded stories until it started to get dark outside, and I left them to tend to their business.\nI prowled the city for a while, going to a few familiar boarding houses and taverns. Two or three public gardens. A bench beneath a tree in a courtyard. Deoch told me he hadn\u2019t so much as glimpsed Denna\u2019s shadow in a year. But even looking for her and not finding her was comforting in a way. In some ways that seemed to be the heart of our relationship.\nLater that night I climbed onto Mains and made my way through the familiar maze of chimneys and mismatched slate and clay and tin. I came around a corner and saw Auri sitting on a chimney, her long, fine hair floating around her head as if she were underwater. She was staring up at the moon and swinging her bare feet.\nI cleared my throat softly, and Auri turned to look. She hopped off the chimney and came scampering across the roof, pulling up a few steps short of me. Her grin was brighter than the moon. \u201cThere is a whole family of hedgehogs living in Cricklet!\u201d she said excitedly.\nAuri took two more steps and grabbed my hand with both of hers. \u201cThere are babies tiny as acorns!\u201d She tugged at me gently. \u201cWill you come see?\u201d\n \nI nodded, and Auri led me across the roof to the apple tree we could use to climb down into the courtyard. When we finally got there, she looked at the tree, then down to where she still held my long, tan hand with both of her tiny white ones. Her grip wasn\u2019t tight, but it was firm, and she didn\u2019t give any sign of letting go.\n\u201cI missed you,\u201d she said softly without looking up. \u201cDon\u2019t go away again.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t ever plan on leaving,\u201d I said gently. \u201cI have too much to do here.\u201d Auri tilted her head sideways to peek up at me through the cloud of her\nhair. \u201cLike visit me?\u201d\n\u201cLike visit you,\u201d I agreed.", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-THREE": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-THREE\nBloodless\nTHERE WAS ONE FINAL surprise waiting for me on my return to the University.\nI\u2019d been back for a handful of days before I returned to my work in the Fishery. While I was no longer in desperate need of money, I missed the work. There is something deeply satisfying in shaping something with your hands. Proper artificing is like a song made solid. It is an act of creation.\nSo I went to Stocks, thinking to start with something simple, as I was out of practice. As I approached the window, I saw a familiar face. \u201cHello Basil,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat did you do to get stuck here this time?\u201d\nHe looked down. \u201cImproper handling of reagents,\u201d he muttered.\nI laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s not so bad. You\u2019ll be out in a span or so.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d He looked up and gave a shamefaced grin. \u201cI heard you were\nback. You come for your credit?\u201d\nI stopped halfway through my mental list of everything I\u2019d need to make a\nheat funnel. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\nBasil cocked his head to the side. \u201cYour credit,\u201d he repeated. \u201cFor the\nBloodless.\u201d He looked at me for a moment, then realization dawned on his face. \u201cThat\u2019s right, you wouldn\u2019t know. . . .\u201d He stepped away from the window for a moment, and returned with something that looked like an eightsided lamp made entirely of iron.\nIt was different than the arrowcatch I\u2019d made. The one I\u2019d constructed was built from scratch and rather rough around the edges. This one was smooth and sleek. All the pieces fit together snugly, and it was covered in a thin layer of clear alchemical enamel that would protect it from rain and rust. Clever, I should have included that in my original design.\nWhile part of me was flattered that someone had liked my design enough to copy it, a larger part of me was irritated to see an arrowcatch so much more polished than my original. I noticed a telltale uniformity in the pieces. \u201cSomeone made a set of moldings?\u201d I asked.", "Basil nodded. \u201cOh yes. Ages ago. Two sets.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve got to say, it\u2019s clever stuff. Took me a long while to get my head around how the inertial trigger worked, but now that I\u2019ve got it. . .\u201d He tapped his forehead. \u201cI\u2019ve made two myself. Good money for the time they take. Beats the hell out of deck lamps.\u201d\nThat wrung a smile out of me. \u201cAnything is better than deck lamps,\u201d I agreed, picking it up. \u201cIs this one of yours?\u201d\nHe shook his head. \u201cMine sold a month back. They don\u2019t sit long. Clever of you to price them so low.\u201d\nI turned it over in my hands and saw a word grooved into the metal. The blocky letters went deep into the iron, so I knew they were part of the mold. They read, \u201cBloodless.\u201d\nI looked up at Basil. He smiled. \u201cYou took off without giving it a proper name,\u201d he said. \u201cThen Kilvin formalized the schema and added it to the records. We needed to call it something before we started to sell it.\u201d His smile faded a bit. \u201cBut that was around the same time word came back you\u2019d been lost at sea. So Kilvin brought in Master Elodin. . . .\u201d\n\u201cTo give it a proper name,\u201d I said, still turning it in my hands. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u201cKilvin grumbled a bit,\u201d Basil said. \u201cCalled it dramatic nonsense. But it stuck.\u201d He shrugged and ducked down and rummaged a bit before bringing up a book. \u201cAnyway, you want your credit?\u201d He started flipping pages. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a chunk of it built up by now. Lot of folk have been making them.\u201d\nHe found the page he wanted and ran his finger along the ledger line. \u201cThere we are. Sold twenty-eight so far . . .\u201d\n\u201cBasil,\u201d I said. \u201cI really don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re talking about. Kilvin already paid me for the first one I made.\u201d\nBasil furrowed his brow. \u201cYour commission,\u201d he said matter-of-factly. Then, seeing my blank look, he continued. \u201cEvery time Stocks sells something, the Fishery gets a thirty percent commission and whoever owns the schema gets ten percent.\u201d\n\u201cI thought Stocks kept the whole forty,\u201d I said, shocked.\nHe lifted one shoulder in a shrug. \u201cMost times it does. Stocks owns most of the old schemas. Most things have already been invented. But for something new . . .\u201d\n\u201cManet never mentioned that,\u201d I said.\nBasil gave an apologetic grimace. \u201cOld Manet is a workhorse,\u201d he said", "politely. \u201cBut he\u2019s not the most innovative fellow around. He\u2019s been here, what, thirty years? I don\u2019t think he has a single schema to his name.\u201d He flipped through the book a bit, scanning the pages. \u201cMost serious artificers have at least one just as a point of pride, even if it\u2019s something fairly useless.\u201d\nNumbers spun in my head. \u201cSo ten percent of eight talents each,\u201d I murmured, then looked up. \u201cI\u2019ve got twenty-two talents waiting for me?\u201d\nBasil nodded, looking at the entry in the book. \u201cTwenty-two and four,\u201d he said, bringing out a pencil and a piece of paper. \u201cYou want all of it?\u201d\nI grinned.\nWhen I set out for Imre my purse was so heavy I feared I might develop a limp. I stopped by Anker\u2019s and picked up my travelsack, resting it on my opposite shoulder to balance things out.\nI wandered through town, idly passing by all the places Denna and I had frequented in the past. I wondered where in the world she might be.\nAfter my ritual search was complete, I made my way to a back alley that smelled of rancid fat and climbed a set of narrow stairs. I knocked briskly on Devi\u2019s door, waited for a long minute, then knocked again, louder.\nThere was the sound of a bolt being thrown and a lock turning. The door cracked open and a single pale blue eye peered out at me. I grinned.\nThe door swung open slowly. Devi stood in the doorway, staring blankly at me, her arms at her sides.\nI raised an eyebrow at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d I said. \u201cNo witty banter?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t do business on the landing,\u201d she said automatically. Her voice was absolutely without inflection. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to come inside.\u201d\nI waited, but she didn\u2019t step out of the doorway. I could smell cinnamon and honey wafting out from the room behind her.\n\u201cDevi?\u201d I asked. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a . . .\u201d She trailed off, still staring at me. Her voice was flat and emotionless. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be dead.\u201d\n\u201cIn this and many other things, I aim to disappoint,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI was sure he\u2019d done it,\u201d Devi continued. \u201cHis father\u2019s barony is called the Pirate Isles. I was sure he\u2019d done it because we\u2019d set fire to his rooms. I was the one that actually set the fire, but he couldn\u2019t know that. You were the\n \nonly one he saw. You and that Cealdish fellow.\u201d\nDevi looked up at me, blinking in the light. The pixie-faced gaelet had\nalways been fair-skinned, but this was the first time I\u2019d ever seen her look pale. \u201cYou\u2019re taller,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d almost forgotten how tall you are.\u201d\n\u201cI almost forgot how pretty you are,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t quite manage it.\u201d\nDevi continued to stand in the doorway, pale and staring. Concerned, I stepped forward and laid my hand lightly on her arm. She didn\u2019t pull away as I half-expected. She simply looked down at my hand.\n\u201cI\u2019m waiting for a quip here,\u201d I teased gently. \u201cYou\u2019re usually quicker than this.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can match wits with you right now,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI never suspected you could match wits with me,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I do like a little banter now and then.\u201d\nDevi gave a ghost of a smile, a little color coming back to her cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019re a horse\u2019s ass,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s more like it,\u201d I said encouragingly as I drew her out of the doorway into the bright autumn afternoon. \u201cI knew you had it in you.\u201d\nThe two of us walked to a nearby inn, and with the help of a short beer and long lunch, Devi recovered from the shock of seeing me alive. Soon she was her usual sharp-tongued self again, and we bantered back and forth over mugs of spiced cider.\nAfterward we strolled back to her rooms behind the butcher shop, where Devi discovered she\u2019d forgotten to lock her door.\n\u201cMerciful Tehlu,\u201d she said, once we were inside, looking around frantically. \u201cThat\u2019s a first.\u201d\nLooking around, I saw that little had changed in her rooms since I\u2019d last seen them, though her second set of bookshelves was almost half full. I looked over the titles as Devi searched the other rooms to make sure nothing was missing.\n\u201cAnything you\u2019d like to borrow?\u201d she asked, as she came back into the room.\n\u201cActually,\u201d I said, \u201cI have something for you.\u201d\n \nI set my travelsack on her desk and rooted around until I found a flat rectangular package wrapped in oilskin and tied with twine. I moved my travelsack onto the floor and put the package on the desk, nudging it toward her.\nDevi approached the desk wearing a dubious expression, then sat down and unwrapped the parcel. Inside was the copy of Celum Tinture I\u2019d stolen from Caudicus\u2019 library. Not a particularly rare book, but a useful resource for an alchemist exiled from the Archives. Not that I knew anything about alchemy, of course.\nDevi looked down at it. \u201cAnd what\u2019s this for?\u201d she asked.\nI laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s a present.\u201d\nShe eyed me narrowly. \u201cIf you think this will get you an extension on your\nloan. . . .\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cI just thought you\u2019d like it,\u201d I said. \u201cAs for the loan . . .\u201d\nI brought out my purse and counted nine thick talents onto her desk. \u201cWell then,\u201d Devi said, mildly surprised. \u201cIt looks like someone had a\nprofitable trip.\u201d She looked up at me. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to wait until after you\u2019ve paid tuition?\u201d\n\u201cAlready taken care of,\u201d I said.\nDevi made no move to take the money. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to leave you penniless at the start of the new term,\u201d she said.\nI hefted my purse in one hand. It clinked with a delightful fullness that was almost musical.\nDevi brought out a key and unlocked a drawer at the bottom of her desk. One by one she brought out my copy of Rhetoric and Logic, my talent pipes, my sympathy lamp, and Denna\u2019s ring.\nShe piled them neatly on her desk, but still didn\u2019t reach for the coins. \u201cYou still have two months before your year and a day is up,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you sure you wouldn\u2019t prefer to wait?\u201d\nPuzzled, I looked down at the money on the table, then around at Devi\u2019s rooms. Realization came to me like a flower unfurling in my head. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about the money at all, is it?\u201d I said, amazed it had taken me this long to figure it out.\nDevi cocked her head to the side.\nI gestured at the bookshelves, the large velvet-curtained bed, at Devi herself. I\u2019d never noticed before, but while her clothes weren\u2019t fancy, the cut and cloth were fine as any noble\u2019s.", "\u201cThis doesn\u2019t have anything to do with money,\u201d I repeated. I looked at her books. Her collection had to be worth five hundred talents if it was worth a penny. \u201cYou use the money as bait. You lend it out to desperate folks who might be useful to you, then hope they can\u2019t pay you back. Your real business is favors.\u201d\nDevi chuckled a bit. \u201cMoney is nice,\u201d she said, her eyes glittering. \u201cBut the world is full of things that people would never sell. Favors and obligation are worth far, far more.\u201d\nI looked down at the nine talents gleaming on her desk. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a minimum loan amount, do you?\u201d I asked, already knowing the answer. \u201cYou just told me that so I\u2019d be forced to borrow more. You were hoping I\u2019d dig myself a hole too deep and not be able to pay you back.\u201d\nDevi smiled brightly. \u201cWelcome to the game,\u201d she said as she began to pick up the coins. \u201cThanks for playing.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-FOUR": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-FOUR\nSword and Shaed\nWITH MY PURSE FULL to bursting and Alveron\u2019s letter of credit assuring my tuition, my winter term was carefree as a walk in the garden.\nIt was strange not having to live like a miser. I had clothes that fit me and could afford to have them laundered. I could have coffee or chocolate whenever I wanted. I no longer needed to toil endlessly in the Fishery and could spend time tinkering simply to satisfy my curiosity or pursue projects simply for the joy of it.\nAfter almost a year away, it took me a while to settle back into the University. It felt odd not wearing a sword after all this time. But such things were frowned on here, and I knew it would cause more trouble than it was worth.\nAt first I left Caesura in my rooms. But I knew better than anyone how easy it would be to break in and steal it. The drop bar would only keep away a very genteel thief. A more pragmatic one could simply break my window and be gone in less than a minute. Since the sword was quite literally irreplaceable, and I\u2019d made promises to keep it safe, it wasn\u2019t long before I moved it to a hiding place in the Underthing.\nMy shaed was easier to keep at hand, as I was able to change its shape with a little work. These days it only rarely billowed on its own. More commonly it refused to move as much as the gusting wind seemed to demand. You\u2019d think people would notice such things, but they didn\u2019t. Even Wilem and Simmon, who teased me about my fondness for it, never marked my cloak as anything more than an exceptionally versatile piece of clothing.\nIn fact, Elodin was the only one to notice anything out of the ordinary about it. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he exclaimed when we crossed paths in a small courtyard outside Mains. \u201cHow did you come to be enshaedn?\u201d\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cYour cloak, boy. Your turning cape. How in God\u2019s sweet grace did you tumble onto a shaed?\u201d He mistook my surprise for ignorance. \u201cDon\u2019t you", "know what you\u2019re wearing?\u201d\n\u201cI know what it is,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m just surprised that you do.\u201d\nHe gave me an insulted look. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be much of a namer if I couldn\u2019t\nspot a faerie cloak a dozen feet away.\u201d He took a corner of it between his fingers. \u201cOh, that\u2019s just lovely. Here\u2019s a piece of old magic man rarely lays a finger on.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s new magic, actually,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked.\nWhen it became obvious my explanation involved a long story, Elodin led\nus into a small, cozy pub I\u2019d never seen before. I hesitate to call it a pub at all, actually. It wasn\u2019t full of chattering students and the smell of beer. It was dim and quiet with a low ceiling and scattered clusters of deep, comfortable chairs. It smelled of leather and old wine.\nWe sat near a warm radiator and sipped mulled cider while I told him the whole story of my unintentional trip into the Fae. It was a wonderful relief. I hadn\u2019t been able to tell anyone yet for fear of being laughed out of the University.\nElodin proved to be a surprisingly attentive audience and was especially interested in the fight Felurian and I had had when she had tried to bend me to her will. After I\u2019d finished the story, he peppered me with questions. Could I remember what I\u2019d said to call the wind? How had it felt? The strange wakefulness I described, was it more like being drunk, or more like going into shock?\nI answered as best I could, and eventually he leaned back in his chair, nodding to himself. \u201cIt\u2019s a good sign when a student goes chasing the wind and catches it,\u201d he said approvingly. \u201cThat\u2019s twice you\u2019ve called it now. It can only get easier.\u201d\n\u201cThree times, actually,\u201d I said. \u201cI found it again when I was off in Ademre.\u201d\nHe laughed. \u201cYou chased it to the edge of the map!\u201d he said, making a broad motion with his splayed left hand. Stunned, I realized it was Adem hand-talk for amazed respect. \u201cHow did it feel? Do you think you could find its name again if you had need of it?\u201d\nI concentrated, trying to nudge my mind into Spinning Leaf. It had been a month and a thousand miles since I\u2019d tried, and it was hard to tip my mind into that strange, tumbling emptiness.\nEventually I managed it. I looked around the small room, hoping to see the", "name of the wind like a familiar friend. But there was nothing there except dust motes swirling in a beam of sunlight that slanted through a window.\n\u201cWell?\u201d Elodin asked. \u201cCould you call it if you needed to?\u201d\nI hesitated. \u201cMaybe.\u201d\nElodin nodded as if he understood. \u201cBut probably not if someone were to\nask you to?\u201d\nI nodded, more than a little disappointed.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be discouraged. It will give us something to work toward.\u201d He\ngrinned happily and clapped me on the back. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s more to your story than you realize. You called more than the wind. From what you\u2019ve said, I believe you called Felurian\u2019s name itself.\u201d\nI thought back. My memories of my time in the Fae were oddly patchy, none more than my confrontation with Felurian, which had an odd, almost dreamlike quality to it. When I tried to remember it in detail, it almost seemed as if it had happened to another person. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than possible,\u201d he assured me. \u201cI doubt a creature as old and powerful as Felurian could be subdued with nothing more than wind. Not to belittle your accomplishment,\u201d he hurried to add. \u201cCalling the wind is more than one student in a thousand ever manages. But calling the name of a living thing, let alone one of the Fae . . .\u201d He raised his eyebrows at me. \u201cThat\u2019s a horse of a different color.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would a person\u2019s name be so much different?\u201d I asked, then answered my own question. \u201cThe complexity.\u201d\n\u201cExactly,\u201d he said. My understanding seemed to excite him. \u201cTo name a thing you must understand it entire. A stone or a piece of wind is difficult enough. A person . . .\u201d He trailed off significantly.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t claim to understand Felurian,\u201d I said.\n\u201cSome part of you did,\u201d he insisted. \u201cYour sleeping mind. A rare thing indeed. If you\u2019d known how difficult it was, you never would have stood a chance of doing it.\u201d\nSince poverty no longer forced me to work endless hours in the Fishery, I was free to study more broadly than ever before. I continued my usual classes in sympathy, medicine, and artificing, then added chemistry, herbology, and\n \ncomparative female anatomy.\nMy curiosity had been pricked by my encounter with the Lockless box, and\nI attempted to learn something about Yllish story knots. But I quickly discovered most books on Yll were historical, not linguistic, and gave no information as to how I might actually read a knot.\nSo I scoured the Dead Ledgers and discovered a single shelf of disused books concerning Yll in one of the unpleasant, low-ceilinged sections of the lower basements. Then, while looking for a place to sit and read, I discovered a small room tucked behind a piece of jutting shelving.\nIt wasn\u2019t a reading hole as I suspected. Inside were hundreds of large wooden spools wound about with knotted string. They weren\u2019t books, precisely, but they were the Yllish equivalent. A thin layer of dust covered everything, and I doubted anyone had been in the room for decades.\nI have a vast weakness for secret things. But I quickly found that reading the knots was impossible without first understanding Yllish. There were no classes on the subject, and asking around revealed none of Master Linguist\u2019s gillers knew more than a scattering of words.\nI wasn\u2019t terribly surprised, considering Yll had been nearly ground to dust under the iron boots of the Aturan Empire. The piece that remained today was populated mostly by sheep. And if you stood in the middle of the country, you could throw a stone across the border. Still, it was a disappointing end to my search.\nThen, several days later, Master Linguist summoned me to his office. He\u2019d heard that I\u2019d been making inquiries, and he happened to speak Yllish rather well. He offered to tutor me personally, and I gladly took him up on his offer.\nSince I\u2019d come to the University, I\u2019d only seen Master Linguist during admissions interviews and when I was brought up on the horns for disciplinary reasons. Acting as Chancellor, he was rather grim and formal. But when he wasn\u2019t sitting in the Chancellor\u2019s chair, Master Herma was a surprisingly deft and gentle teacher. He was witty with a surprisingly irreverent sense of humor. The first time he told me a dirty joke, you could have knocked me over with a feather.\nElodin wasn\u2019t teaching a class this term, but I began to study naming privately under his direction. It went more smoothly now that I understood there was a method to his madness.\nCount Threpe was overjoyed to find me alive and threw a resurrection party where I was proudly displayed to the local nobility. I had a suit of", "clothes tailored specifically for the event, and in a fit of nostalgia I chose to have them done in the colors my old troupe had worn: the green and grey of Lord Greyfallow\u2019s men.\nAfter the party, over a bottle of wine in his sitting room, I told Threpe of my adventures. I left off the story of Felurian, as I knew he wouldn\u2019t believe it. And I couldn\u2019t tell him half of what I\u2019d done in the Maer\u2019s service. Consequently, Threpe thought Alveron had been quite generous in rewarding me. I didn\u2019t argue the point.", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-FIVE": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-FIVE\nStories\nAMBROSE HAD BEEN BLESSEDLY absent during the winter term, but when spring arrived he came back to roost like some sort of hateful, migratory bird. By no coincidence, the day after he returned, I skipped all my classes and spent the entire day making myself a new gram.\nAs soon as the snow melted and the ground grew firm again, I resumed my practice of the Ketan. Remembering how odd it had looked when I\u2019d first seen it, I did this in the privacy of the forest north of the University.\nWith spring term came a new round of admissions. I showed up for my interview with a profound hangover and fumbled a few questions. My tuition was set at eighteen talents and five, earning me four talents and change from the Bursar.\nSales of the Bloodless had slackened over the winter, as there were fewer merchants visiting the University. But once snows melted and roads grew dry, the handful that had accumulated in the Stocks sold quickly, bringing me another six talents.\nI was unused to having so much money at my disposal, and I\u2019ll admit I went a little mad with it. I owned six suits of clothes that fit me and had all the paper I could use. I bought fine, dark ink from Arueh and purchased my own set of engraving tools. I had two pairs of shoes. Two.\nI found an ancient, ragged Yllish dictum buried in a bookstore in Imre. Full of drawings of knots, the bookstore owner thought it was a sailor\u2019s journal and I bought it for a mere talent and a half. Not long after I bought a copy of The Heroborica, then added a copy of Termigus Techina I could use as a reference while designing schema in the privacy of my own room.\nI bought dinner for my friends. Auri had new dresses and bright ribbons for her hair. All this and still money in my purse. How odd. How wonderful.\n \nToward the middle of the term I began to hear familiar stories. Stories about a certain red-haired adventurer who had spent the night with Felurian. Stories of a dashing young arcanist with all the powers of Taborlin the Great. It had taken months, but my exploits in Vintas had finally passed their way from mouth to ear all the long miles back to the University.\nIt may be true that when I finally became aware of these stories I lengthened my shaed a bit and wore it more often than before. It might also be the case that I spent a shameful amount of time in alehouses over the next several span, lurking quietly, listening to stories. I might even have gone so far as to offer a suggestion or two.\nI was young, after all, and it was only natural for me to delight in my notoriety. I thought it would fade in time. Why shouldn\u2019t I revel a bit in the sidelong glances my fellow students made? Why not enjoy it while it lasted?\nMany of the stories centered around me hunting bandits and rescuing young girls. But none of them came terribly close to the truth. No story can move a thousand miles by word of mouth and keep its shape.\nWhile the details differed, most of them followed a familiar thread: young women were in need of rescuing. Sometimes a nobleman hired me. Sometimes it was a concerned father, a distraught mayor, or a bumbling constable.\nMost of the time I saved a pair of girls. Sometimes only one, sometimes there were three. They were best friends. They were mother and daughter. I heard one story where there were seven of them, all sisters, all beautiful princesses, all virgins. You know that sort of story.\nThere was a great deal of variety as to who exactly I was rescuing the girls from. Bandits were fairly common, but there were also wicked uncles, stepmothers, and shamble-men. One story, in an odd twist, had me rescuing them from Adem mercenaries. There was even an ogre or two.\nWhile I did occasionally rescue the girls from a troupe of traveling players, I\u2019m proud to say I never heard a story where they were kidnapped by the Edema Ruh.\nThe story generally had one of two endings. In the first I leapt to the battle like Prince Gallant and fought sword on sword until everyone was dead, fled, or appropriately repentant. The second ending was more popular. It involved me calling down fire and lightning from the sky after the fashion of Taborlin the Great.\nIn my favorite version of the story, I met a helpful tinker on the road. I", "shared my dinner, and he told me of two children stolen from a nearby farm. Before I left, he sold me an egg, three iron nails, and a shabby cloak that could render me invisible. I used the items and my considerable wit to save the children from the clutches of a cunning, hungry trow.\nBut while there were many versions of that tale, the story of Felurian was more popular by far. The song I\u2019d written had made the journey west as well. And since songs hold their shape better than stories, the details about my encounter with Felurian were moderately close to the truth.\nWhen Wil and Sim pressed me for details, I told them the whole story. It took me a while to convince them I was telling the truth. Rather, it took me a while to convince Sim. For some reason,Wil was perfectly willing to accept the existence of the Fae.\nI didn\u2019t blame Sim. Until I saw her, I would have bet solid money Felurian didn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s one thing to enjoy a story, but it\u2019s quite another to take it for the truth.\n\u201cThe real question,\u201d Sim said thoughtfully, \u201cis how old you really are.\u201d \u201cI know that one,\u201d Wilem said with the somber pride of someone\ndesperately pretending to not be drunk. \u201cSeventeen.\u201d\n\u201cAhhhh . . .\u201d Sim held up a finger dramatically. \u201cYou\u2019d think so, wouldn\u2019t\nyou?\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I asked.\nSim leaned forward in his chair. \u201cYou went into the Fae, spent some time\nthere, then came out to discover only three days had passed,\u201d Sim said. \u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re only three days older? Or did you age while you were there?\u201d\nI was quiet for a moment. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that,\u201d I admitted.\n\u201cIn stories,\u201d Wilem said, \u201cboys go into Fae and return as men.That implies one grows older.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to go by stories,\u201d Sim said.\n\u201cWhat else?\u201d Wil asked. \u201cWill you consult Marlock\u2019s Compendium of Fae Phenomenon? Find me such a book, and I will reference it.\u201d\nSim gave an agreeable shrug.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Wil said, turning to me. \u201cHow long were you there?\u201d\n \n\u201cThat\u2019s hard to figure,\u201d I said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any day or night. And my memories are a bit odd.\u201d I thought for a long moment. \u201cWe talked, swam, ate dozens upon dozens of times, explored a bit. And, well ...\u201d I paused to clear my throat meaningfully.\n\u201cCavorted,\u201d suggested Wil.\n\u201cThank you. And cavorted quite a bit as well.\u201d I counted the skills Felurian had taught me, and then figured she couldn\u2019t have taught me more than two or three a day. . . .\n\u201cIt was at least a couple months,\u201d I said. \u201cI shaved once, or was it twice? Time enough for me to grow a bit of a beard.\u201d\nWil rolled his eyes at this, running his hand over his own dark Cealdish beard.\n\u201cNothing like your marvelous facebear,\u201d I said. \u201cStill, mine grew out at least two or three times.\u201d\n\u201cSo at least two months,\u201d Sim said. \u201cBut how long could it have been?\u201d\n\u201cThree months?\u201d How many stories had we shared? \u201cFour or five months?\u201d I thought of how slowly we\u2019d had to move my shaed from starlight to moonlight to firelight. \u201cA year?\u201d I thought about the wretched time I\u2019d spent recovering from my encounter with the Cthaeh. \u201cI\u2019m sure it couldn\u2019t have been more than a year. . . .\u201d My voice didn\u2019t sound nearly as convincing as I would have liked.\nWilem raised an eyebrow. \u201cWell then, happy birthday.\u201d He lifted his glass to me. \u201cOr birthdays, depending.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-SIX": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-SIX\nFailures\nDURING SPRING TERM I experienced several failures.\nThe first of these was mostly a failure in my own eyes. I had expected that\npicking up Yllish would be relatively easy. But nothing could have been further from the truth.\nIn a handful of days I had learned enough Tema to defend myself in court. But Tema was a very orderly language, and I\u2019d already known a little bit from my studies. Perhaps most importantly, there was a great deal of overlap between Tema and Aturan. They used the same characters for writing, and many words are related.\nYllish shared nothing with Aturan or Shaldish, or even with Ademic for that matter. It was an irrational, tangled mess. Fourteen indicative verb tenses. Bizarre formal inflections of address.\nYou couldn\u2019t merely say \u201cthe Chancellor\u2019s socks.\u201d Oh no. Too simple. All ownership was oddly dual: as if the Chancellor owned his socks, but at the same time the socks somehow also gained ownership of the Chancellor. This altered the use of both words in complex grammatical ways. As if the simple act of owning socks somehow fundamentally changed the nature of a person.\nSo even after months of study with the Chancellor, Yllish grammar was still a muddy jumble to me. All I had to show for my work was a messy smattering of vocabulary. My understanding of the story knots was even worse. I tried to improve matters by practicing with Deoch. But he wasn\u2019t much of a teacher and admitted the only person he\u2019d ever known who could read story knots had been his grandmother who had died when he was very young.\nSecond came my failure in advanced chemistry, taken under Mandrag\u2019s giller, Anisat. While the material fascinated me, I did not get along with Anisat himself.\nI loved the discovery chemistry offered. I loved the thrill of experiment, the challenge of trial and retrial. I loved the puzzle of it. I also will admit a", "somewhat foolish fondness toward the apparatus involved. The bottles and tubes. The acids and salts. The mercury and flame. There is something primal in chemistry, something that defies explication. Either you feel it or you don\u2019t.\nAnisat didn\u2019t feel it. For him chemistry was written journals and carefully penned rows of numbers. He would make me perform the same titration four times simply because my notation was incorrect. Why write a number down? Why should I take ten minutes to write what my hands could finish in five?\nSo we argued. Gently at first, but neither of us were willing to back down. As a result, barely two span into the term we ended up shouting at each other in the middle of the Crucible while thirty students looked on, openmouthed with dismay.\nHe told me to leave his class, calling me an irreverent dennerling with no respect for authority. I called him a pompous slipstick who had missed his true calling as a counting-house scribe. In all fairness, we both had some valid points.\nMy other failure came in mathematics. After listening to Fela chatter excitedly for months about what she was learning under Master Brandeur, I set out to further my number lore.\nUnfortunately the loftier peaks of mathematics did not delight me. I am no poet. I do not love words for the sake of words. I love words for what they can accomplish. Similarly, I am no arithmetician. Numbers that speak only of numbers are of little interest to me.\nDue to my abandonment of chemistry and arithmetic, I had a great deal of free time on my hands. Some of this I spent in the Fishery, making a Bloodless of my own that sold practically before it hit the shelves. I also spent a fair amount of time in the Archives and the Medica, doing research for an essay titled \u201cOn the Non-Efficacy of Arrowroot.\u201d Arwyl was skeptical, but agreed my initial research warranted attention.\nI also spent some of my time romantically. It was a new experience for me, as I had never caught the eye of women before. Or if I had, I hadn\u2019t known what to do with the attention.\nBut I was older now, and wiser to some degree. And because of the stories circulating, women on both sides of the river were beginning to show an interest in me.\nMy romances were all pleasant and brief. I cannot say why brief, except to state the obvious: that I do not have much in me that might encourage a", "woman to make long habit of my company. Simmon, for example, had a great deal to offer. He was a gemstone in the rough. Not stunning at first glance, but with a great deal of worth beneath the surface. Sim was tender, kind, and attentive as any woman could care for. He made Fela deliriously happy. Sim was a prince.\nBy contrast, what did I have to offer? Nothing really. Less now. I was more like a curious stone that is picked up, carried a while, and finally dropped again with the realization that for all its interesting look, it is nothing more than hardened earth.\n\u201cMaster Kilvin,\u201d I asked. \u201cCan you think of a metal that will stand hard use for two thousand years and remain relatively unworn or unblemished?\u201d\nThe huge artificer looked up from the brass gear he was inscribing and eyed me standing in the doorway of his office. \u201cAnd what manner of project are you planning now, Re\u2019lar Kvothe?\u201d\nIn the last three months, I\u2019d been trying to create another schema as successful as my Bloodless. Partly for the money, but also because I\u2019d learned that Kilvin was much more likely to promote students with three or four impressive schema to their credit.\nUnfortunately, I had met with a string of failures here, too. I\u2019d had more than a dozen clever ideas, none of which had led to a finished design.\nMost of the ideas were struck down by Kilvin himself. Eight of my clever ideas had already been created, some of them more than a hundred years ago. Five of them, Kilvin informed me, would require the use of runes that were forbidden to Re\u2019lar. Three of them were mathematically unsound, and he quickly sketched out how they were doomed to failure, saving me dozens of hours of wasted time.\nOne of my ideas, he rejected as \u201cutterly inappropriate for a responsible artificer.\u201d I argued that a mechanism that would cut the time needed to reload a ballista would help ships defend against piracy. It would help defend towns against attack by Vi Sembi raiders. . . .\nBut Kilvin would hear none of it. When his face began to grow dark as a storm cloud, I quickly abandoned my carefully planned arguments.\nIn the end, only two of my ideas were sound, acceptable, and original. But\n \nafter weeks of work, I was forced to abandon them as well, unable to get them to work.\nKilvin set down his stylus and half-inscribed brass gear, turning to face me. \u201cI admire a student who thinks in terms of durability, Re\u2019lar Kvothe. But a thousand years is a great deal to ask of stone, let alone metal. To say nothing of metal put to heavy use.\u201d\nI was asking about Caesura, of course. But I hesitated to tell Kilvin the full truth. I knew all too well that the Master Artificer did not approve of artificery being used in conjunction with any sort of weapon. While he might appreciate the craftsmanship of such a sword, he would not think well of me for owning such a thing.\nI smiled. \u201cIt isn\u2019t for a project,\u201d I said. \u201cI was just curious. During my travels I was shown a sword that was quite serviceable and sharp. Despite this, there seemed to be proof that it was over two thousand years old. Do you know of any metal that could avoid breaking for so long as that? Let alone keep an edge?\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d Kilvin nodded, his expression not particularly surprised. \u201cThere are such things. Old magics, one could say. Or old arts now lost to us. These things are scattered through the world. Marvelous devices. Mysteries. There are many reliable sources that speak of the ever-burning lamp.\u201d He gestured with a broad hand at the hemispheres of glass laid out on his worktable. \u201cWe even possess a handful of these things here at the University.\u201d\nI felt my curiosity flare up. \u201cWhat sort of things?\u201d I asked.\nKilvin tugged his beard idly with one hand. \u201cI have a device devoid of any sygaldry that seems to do nothing but consume angular momentum. I have four ingots of white metal, lighter than water, that I can neither melt nor mar in any way. A sheet of black glass, one side of which lacks any frictive properties at all. A piece of oddly shaped stone that maintains a temperate slightly above freezing, no matter what the heat around it.\u201d His massive shoulders shrugged. \u201cThese things are mysteries.\u201d\nI opened my mouth, then hesitated. \u201cWould it be inappropriate for me to ask to see some of these things?\u201d\nKilvin\u2019s smile was very white against the dark of his skin and his beard. \u201cIt is never inappropriate to ask, Re\u2019lar Kvothe,\u201d he said. \u201cA student should be curious. I would be troubled if you were indifferent to such things.\u201d\nThe big artificer went to his large wooden desk, so strewn with half- finished projects that the surface was barely visible. He unlocked a drawer", "with a key from his pocket and drew out two dull metal cubes, slightly larger than dice.\n\u201cMany of these old things we cannot fathom or make use of,\u201d he said. \u201cBut some possess remarkable utility.\u201d He rattled the two metal cubes as if they were dice, and they rang together sweetly in his hand. \u201cWe call these warding stones.\u201d\nHe bent and set them on the floor, spaced several feet apart from each other. He touched them and spoke very softly under his breath, too quietly for me to hear.\nI felt a subtle change in the air. At first I thought that the room was growing colder, but then I realized the truth: I couldn\u2019t feel the radiant heat of the smoldering forge at the other end of Kilvin\u2019s office.\nKilvin casually picked up the bar of iron used to stir the forge and swung it hard at my head. His gesture was so casual that it caught me completely off my guard, and I didn\u2019t even have time to cower or flinch away.\nThe bar stopped two feet away from me, as if striking some unseen obstruction. There was no sound as if it had struck something, neither did it rebound in Kilvin\u2019s grip.\nI reached out my hand cautiously and it butted up against . . . nothing. It was as if the intangible air in front of me was suddenly made solid.\nKilvin grinned at me. \u201cThe warding stones are of particular use when performing dangerous experiments or testing certain equipment,\u201d he said. \u201cThey somehow produce a thaumic and kinetic barrier.\u201d\nI continued to run my hand along the unseen barrier. It wasn\u2019t hard, or even solid. It gave way slightly when I pushed at it and felt slippery as buttered glass.\nKilvin watched me, his expression faintly amused. \u201cTruthfully, Re\u2019lar Kvothe, until Elodin made his suggestion, I was thinking of calling your arrow-arresting device the Minor Ward.\u201d He frowned slightly. \u201cNot entirely accurate, of course, but more so than Elodin\u2019s dramatic nonsense.\u201d\nI leaned hard against the unseen barrier. It was solid as a stone wall. Now that I was looking more closely, I could see a subtle distortion in the air, as if I were looking through a slightly imperfect sheet of glass. \u201cThis is far superior to my arrowcatch, Master Kilvin.\u201d\n\u201cTrue.\u201d Kilvin gave a conciliatory nod and bent to pick up the stones, muttering again under his breath. I staggered a little when the barrier disappeared. \u201cBut your cleverness we can repeat endlessly. This mystery we", "cannot.\u201d\nKilvin held up the two cubes of metal on the palm of his huge hand.\n\u201cThese are useful, but never forget: cleverness and caution profit the artificer. We do our work in the realm of the real.\u201d He closed his fingers over the warding stones. \u201cLeave mystery to poets, priests, and fools.\u201d\nDespite my other failures, my study with Master Elodin was progressing rather well. He claimed all I needed to improve myself as a namer was time and dedication. I gave him both, and he put them to use in odd ways.\nWe spent hours riddling. He made me drink a pint of applejack, then read Teccam\u2019s Theophany from cover to cover. He made me wear a blindfold for three days straight, which didn\u2019t improve my performance in my other classes, but amused Wil and Sim to no end.\nHe encouraged me to see how long I could stay awake. And since I could afford all the coffee I liked, I managed nearly five days. Though by the end I was rather manic and starting to hear voices.\nAnd there was the incident on the roof of the Archives. Everyone has heard about that in one version or another, it seems.\nThere was a great beast of a thunderstorm rolling in, and Elodin decided it would do me good to spend some time in the middle of it. The closer the better, he said. He knew Lorren would never allow us access to the roof of the Archives, so Elodin simply stole the key.\nUnfortunately, that meant when the key went tumbling off the roof, no one knew we were trapped up there. As a result the two of us were forced to spend the entire night on the bare stone rooftop, caught in the teeth of the furious storm.\nIt wasn\u2019t until midmorning that the weather calmed enough for us to call down to the courtyard for help. Then, as there didn\u2019t seem to be a second key, Lorren took the straightest course and had several burly scrivs simply batter down the door leading to the roof.\nNone of this would have been a particular problem if, just as it had started to rain, Elodin hadn\u2019t insisted that we strip ourselves naked, wrap our clothes in an oilskin, and weigh them down with a brick. According to Elodin, it would help me experience the storm to the fullest degree possible.\n \nThe winds were stronger than he\u2019d expected, and they had snatched both the brick and our bundled clothes, hurling them into the sky like a handful of leaves. That was how we lost the key, you see. It had been in the pocket of Elodin\u2019s pants.\nBecause of this, Master Lorren, Lorren\u2019s giller Distrel, and three brawny scrivs found Elodin and me stark naked and wet as drowned rats on the roof of the Archives. Within fifteen minutes, everyone in the University had heard the story. Elodin laughed his head off at the whole thing, and though I can see the humor of it now, at the time I was far from amused.\nI won\u2019t burden you with the entire list of our activities. Suffice to say that Elodin went to great lengths to wake my sleeping mind. Ridiculous lengths, really.\nAnd much to my surprise, our work paid dividends. I called the name of the wind three times that term.\nThe first time I stilled the wind for the space of a long breath while standing on Stonebridge in the middle of the night. Elodin was there, coaching me. By which I mean he was prodding me with a riding crop. I was also barefoot and more than slightly drunk.\nThe second time came on me unexpectedly while I was studying in Tomes. I was reading a book of Yllish history when suddenly the air in the cavernous room whispered to me. I listened as Elodin had taught me, then spoke it gently. Just as gently the hidden wind stirred into a breeze, startling the students and sending the scrivs into a panic.\nThe name faded from my mind some minutes later, but while it lasted I held the certain knowledge that should I wish it, I could stir a storm or start a thunderclap with equal ease. The knowledge itself had to be enough for me. If I had called the wind\u2019s name strongly in the Archives, Lorren would have hung me by my thumbs above the outer doors.\nYou may not think these terribly impressive feats of naming, and I suppose you are right. But I called the wind a third time that spring, and third time pays for all.", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-SEVEN": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-SEVEN\nDebts\nSINCE I HAD A great deal of free time on my hands, midway through the term I hired the use of a two horse fetter-cart and headed to Tarbean on a bit of a lark.\nIt took me all of Reaving to get there, and I spent most of Cendling visiting old haunts and paying old debts: a cobbler who had been kind to a shoeless boy, an innkeeper who had let me sleep on his hearth some nights, a tailor I had terrorized.\nParts of Waterside were strikingly familiar, while other pieces I didn\u2019t recognize at all. That didn\u2019t particularly surprise me. A city as busy as Tarbean is constantly changing. What did surprise me was the strange nostalgia I felt for this place that had been so cruel to me.\nI had been gone for two years. For all practical purposes it was a lifetime ago.\nIt had been a span of days since the last rain, and the city was dry as a bone. The shuffling feet of a hundred thousand people kicked up a cloud of fine dust that filled the city streets. It covered my clothes and got in my hair and eyes, making them itch. I tried not to dwell on the fact that it was mostly pulverized horseshit, with an assortment of dead fish, coal smoke, and urine thrown in for flavor.\nIf I breathed through my nose, I was assaulted with the smell. But if I breathed through my mouth, I could taste it, and the dust filled my lungs making me cough. I didn\u2019t remember it being as bad as this. Had it always been so dirty here? Had it always smelled this bad?\nAfter half an hour of searching, I finally found the burned-out building with a basement underneath. I made my way down the stairs and through the long hallway to a damp room. Trapis was still there, barefoot and wearing the same tattered robe, tending to his hopeless children in the cool dark below the city streets.\nHe recognized me. Not as other people would, not as a budding hero out of", "stories. Trapis had no time for such things. He remembered me as the smudgy, starveling boy who fell down his stairs fever-sick and crying one winter night. You could say I loved him even more for that.\nI gave him as much money as he would take: five talents. I tried to give him more, but he refused. If he spent too much money, he said, it would attract the wrong sort of attention. He and his children were safest if nobody noticed them.\nI bowed to his wisdom and spent the remainder of the day helping him. I pumped water and fetched bread. I made a quick examination of the children, then took a trip to an apothecary and brought back a few things that would help.\nLastly I tended to Trapis himself, at least as much as he would allow. I rubbed his poor, swollen feet with camphor and mother\u2019s leaf, then made him a gift of tight-fitting stockings and a good pair of shoes so he wouldn\u2019t have to go barefoot in the damp of the basement anymore.\nAs the afternoon faded into evening, ragged children began to arrive in the basement. They came looking for a bit of food, or because they were hurt or hoping for a safe place to sleep. They all eyed me suspiciously. My clothes were new and clean. I didn\u2019t belong there. I wasn\u2019t welcome.\nIf I stayed there would be trouble. At the very least, my presence would make some of the starveling children so uncomfortable they wouldn\u2019t stay the night. So I said good-bye to Trapis and left. Sometimes leaving is the only thing you can do.\nSince I had a few hours before the taverns started to fill up, I bought a single piece of creamy writing paper and a matching envelope of heavy parchment. They were extremely fine quality, much nicer than anything I\u2019d ever owned before.\nNext I found a quiet caf\u00e9 and ordered drinking chocolate with a glass of water. I arranged the paper on the table and brought out pen and ink from my shaed. Then I wrote in an elegant, fluid script:\nAmbrose,\nThe child is yours.You know it is true and so do I.\n \nI fear my family will disown me. If you do not behave as a gentleman and see to your obligations, I will go to your father and tell him everything.\nDo not test me in this, I am resolved.\nI didn\u2019t sign a name, merely wrote a single initial which could have been an ornate R or perhaps a shaky B.\nThen, dipping my finger into my glass of water, I let several drops fall onto the page. They swelled the paper a bit and smeared the ink slightly before I blotted them away. They made a fair approximation of teardrops.\nI let one final heavy drop fall onto the initial I\u2019d signed, obscuring it even more. Now the letter looked as if it could also be an F or a P or an E. Perhaps even a K. It could be anything, really.\nI folded the paper carefully, then walked over to one of the room\u2019s lamps and melted a generous blob of sealing wax onto the fold. On the outside of the envelope I wrote:\nAmbrose Jakis\nUniversity (Two miles west of Imre) Belenay-Barren\nCentral Commonwealth\nI paid for my drink and headed to Drover\u2019s Lot. When I was just a few streets away I removed my shaed and tucked it into my travelsack. Then I dropped the letter in the street and stepped on it, scuffing it around with my foot a bit before picking it up and brushing it off.\nI was almost to the square when I saw the final thing I needed. \u201cHoy there,\u201d I said to an old, whiskery man sitting against a building. \u201cI\u2019ll give you ha\u2019penny if you let me borrow your hat.\u201d\nThe old man pulled the draggled thing off and looked at it. His head was very bald and very pale underneath. He squinted a bit in the late afternoon sunlight. \u201cMy hat?\u201d he asked, his voice rough. \u201cYou can have it for a whole penny, and my blessing too.\u201d He gave a hopeful grin as he held out a thin, shaky hand.\nI gave him a penny. \u201cCould you hold this for a second?\u201d I passed him the envelope, then used both hands to screw the old, shapeless hat down over my ears. I used a nearby shop window to make sure every scrap of my red hair", "was tucked away underneath.\n\u201cSuits you,\u201d the old man said, giving a phlegmy cough. I reclaimed the\nletter and eyed the smudgy fingerprints he\u2019d left.\nFrom there it was a quick step to Drover\u2019s Square. I slouched a bit and\nnarrowed my eyes as I wandered through the milling throng. After a couple minutes my ear caught the distinctive sound of a southern Vintish accent, and I walked over to a handful of men loading a wagon with burlap sacks.\n\u201cHoy,\u201d I said, putting on the same accent. \u201cYou folk heading up Imre- way?\u201d\nOne of the men heaved his sack into the wagon and walked over, dusting off his hands. \u201cHeadin\u2019 through there,\u201d he said. \u201cYou looking for a ride?\u201d\nI shook my head and brought the letter out of my travelsack. \u201cI\u2019ve got a letter for up that way. I was going to take it myself but my ship sails tomorrow. I bought it from a sailor off in Gannery for a full quater bit,\u201d I said. \u201cHe had it himself off some noble gel for a single bit.\u201d I winked. \u201cShe was quite urgent that it get to him, I hear.\u201d\n\u201cYeh paid quater bit?\u201d the man said, already shaking his head. \u201cYeh grummer. En\u2019t nobody going to pay that much for a letter.\u201d\n\u201cHeh,\u201d I said, holding up a finger. \u201cYeh en\u2019t seen who\u2019s it for yet.\u201d I held it up for him to see.\nHe squinted. \u201cJakis?\u201d he said slowly, then his face lit with recognition. \u201cIs that Baron Jakis\u2019 boy, then?\u201d\nI nodded smugly. \u201cThe eldest himself. Boy rich as that should pay a fair piece for a letter from his lady. Much as whole noble, I figure.\u201d\nHe eyed the letter. \u201cCould be,\u201d he said cautiously. \u201cBut look. It en\u2019t got anything on it other than University. I been up that way. That en\u2019t a small place.\u201d\n\u201cBaron Jakis\u2019 boy en\u2019t going to sleep in a tin shack,\u201d I said crossly. \u201cAsk someone what the fanciest place is, that\u2019s where he\u2019ll be.\u201d\nThe man nodded to himself, his hand creeping unconsciously toward his purse. \u201cI suppose I could take it off your hands,\u201d he said grudgingly. \u201cBut only at a quater bit. I\u2019m taking a risk anyways at that.\u201d\n\u201cHave a heart, now!\u201d I protested pitifully. \u201cI brought it eight hundred miles! That\u2019s worth better\u2019n nothing!\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d he said, pulling coins out of his purse. \u201cI\u2019ll give you three bits then.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d take half a round,\u201d I grumbled.", "\u201cYou\u2019ll take three bits,\u201d he said, holding out a grubby hand.\nI handed him the letter. \u201cRemember to tell him it\u2019s from a noble lady,\u201d I said as I turned to leave. \u201cRich tosh. Get whatever yeh can off him, that\u2019s what I say.\u201d\nI left the square, then straightened my shoulders and took off the hat. I pulled my shaed back out of my travelsack and swirled it easily around my shoulders. I started to whistle, and as I passed the bald old beggar, I returned his hat and gave him the three bits besides.\nWhen I first heard the stories people were telling about me at the University, I\u2019d expected them to be short-lived. I thought they would flare up, then die just as quickly, like a fire exhausting its fuel.\nBut that hadn\u2019t been the case. The tales of Kvothe rescuing girls and bedding Felurian mixed and mingled with scraps of truth and the ridiculous lies I\u2019d spread to bolster my reputation. There was fuel aplenty, so the stories swirled and spread like a brushfire with the wind blowing hard behind it.\nHonestly, I didn\u2019t know if I should be amused or alarmed. When I went to Imre, people would point at me and whisper to each other. My notoriety spread until it was impossible for me to casually cross the river and eavesdrop on the stories people told.\nTarbean, on the other hand, was forty miles away.\nAfter I left Drover\u2019s Lot behind, I returned to the room I\u2019d rented in one of the nicer parts of Tarbean. In this part of the city, the wind off the ocean brushed away the stink and the dust, leaving the air feeling sharp and clear. I called up water for a bath, and in a fit of lavish spending that would have left my younger self dizzy, I paid three pennies to have the porter take my clothes to the nearest Cealdish laundry.\nThen, clean and sweet smelling again, I went down to the taproom.\nI\u2019d picked the inn carefully. It wasn\u2019t fancy, but wasn\u2019t seedy either. The taproom was low-ceilinged and intimate. It sat at the corner of two of Tarbean\u2019s most well-traveled roads, and I could see Cealdish traders rubbing elbows with Yllish sailors and Vintish wagoneers. It was the perfect place for stories.\nIt wasn\u2019t long before I was lurking at the end of the bar, listening to how I\n \nhad killed the Black Beast of Trebon. I was stunned. I had actually killed a rampaging draccus in Trebon, but when Nina had come to visit me a year ago, she hadn\u2019t known my name. My growing reputation had somehow swept through the town of Trebon and gathered up that story in its wake.\nThere at the bar, I learned many things. Apparently, I owned a ring of amber which could force demons to obey me. I could drink all night and never be the worse for it. Locks opened at the barest touch of my hand, and I had a cloak made all out of cobwebs and shadows.\nThat was also the first time I heard anyone call me Kvothe the Arcane. It was not a new name, apparently. The cluster of men listening to the story simply nodded along when they heard it.\nI learned that Kvothe the Arcane knew a word that would stop arrows dead in the air. Kvothe the Arcane only bled if the knife that cut him was made of raw, untempered iron.\nThe young clerk was building to the dramatic finish of the story, and I was genuinely curious as to how I was going to stop the demon beast with my ring shattered and my cloak of shadows nearly burned away. But just as I forced my way into Trebon\u2019s church, shattering the door with a magic word and a single blow of my bare hand, the door of the inn burst open, startling everyone as it banged hard against the wall.\nA young couple stood there. The woman was young and beautiful, dark- haired and dark-eyed. The man was richly dressed and pale with panic. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s the matter!\u201d he cried, looking about wildly. \u201cWe were just walking and then she couldn\u2019t breathe!\u201d\nI was at her side before anyone else in the room had time to stand. She had half-collapsed onto an empty bench, with her escort hovering over her. She had one hand pressed against her chest while the other pushed him away weakly. The man ignored it and crowded close to her, speaking in a low, urgent voice. The woman kept sliding away from him until she was at the edge of the bench.\nI pushed him ungently aside. \u201cI think she wants her space from you right now.\u201d\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d he demanded, his voice shrill. \u201cAre you a physician? Who is this man? Someone fetch a physician at once!\u201d He tried to elbow me aside.\n\u201cYou!\u201d I pointed to a large sailor sitting at a table. \u201cTake this man and put him over there.\u201d My voice snapped like a whip and the sailor jumped to his feet, grabbed the young gentleman by the back of his neck, and scuffed him", "tidily away.\nI turned back to the woman and watched as her perfect mouth opened. She\nstrained and drew in only the barest rasp of a breath. Her eyes were wild and wet with fear. I moved close to her and spoke in my gentlest tones. \u201cYou will be fine. All is well,\u201d I reassured her. \u201cYou need to look in my eyes.\u201d\nHer eyes fixed on mine, then widened in recognition, in amazement. \u201cI need you to breathe for me.\u201d I laid one hand against her straining chest. Her skin was flushed and hot. Her heart was thrilling like a frightened bird. I laid my other hand along her face. I looked deeply into her eyes. They were like dark pools.\nI leaned close enough to kiss her. She smelled of selas flower, of green grass, of road dust. I felt her strain to breathe. I listened. I closed my eyes. I heard the whisper of a name.\nI spoke it soft, but close enough to brush against her lips. I spoke it quiet, but near enough so that the sound of it went twining through her hair. I spoke it hard and firm and dark and sweet.\nThere was a rush of indrawn air. I opened my eyes. The room was still enough that I could hear the velvet rush of her second desperate breath. I relaxed.\nShe laid her hand over mine, over her heart. \u201cI need you to breathe for me,\u201d she repeated. \u201cThat\u2019s seven words.\u201d\n\u201cIt is,\u201d I said.\n\u201cMy hero,\u201d Denna said, and drew a slow and smiling breath.\n\u201cIt were powerful strange,\u201d I heard the sailor say on the other side of the room. \u201cThere were sommat in his voice. I swear by all the salt in me, I felt like a puppet with my string pulled.\u201d\nI listened with half an ear. I guessed the deckhand simply knew to jump when a voice with the proper ring of authority told him to.\nBut there was no sense in telling him that. My performance with Denna, combined with my bright hair and dark cloak, had identified me as Kvothe. So it would be magic, no matter what I had to say about it. I didn\u2019t mind. What I had done tonight was worthy of a story or two.\nBecause they recognized me, folk were watching us, but not coming very\n \nclose. Denna\u2019s gentleman friend had left before we thought to look for him, so the two of us enjoyed a certain privacy in our small corner of the taproom.\n\u201cI should have known I\u2019d come across you here,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re always where I least expect to find you. Have you migrated away from the University at last?\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cI\u2019m playing truant for a couple days.\u201d \u201cAre you heading back soon?\u201d\n\u201cTomorrow, actually. I\u2019ve got a fetter-cart.\u201d\nShe smiled. \u201cWould you like some company?\u201d\nI gave her a frank look. \u201cYou must know the answer to that.\u201d\nDenna blushed a little and looked away. \u201cI suppose I do.\u201d\nWhen she looked down her hair cascaded off her shoulders, falling around\nher face. It smelled warm and rich, like sunshine and cider. \u201cYour hair,\u201d I said. \u201cLovely.\u201d\nSurprisingly, she blushed even deeper at this and shook her head without looking up at me. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve come to after all this time?\u201d she said, darting a look up at me. \u201cFlattery?\u201d\nIt was my turn to be embarrassed, and I stammered. \u201cI ... I wouldn\u2019t . . . I mean, I would . . .\u201d I took a breath before reaching out to lightly touch a narrow, intricate braid, half-hidden in her hair. \u201cYour braid,\u201d I clarified. \u201cIt almost says lovely.\u201d\nHer mouth made a perfect \u201co\u201d of surprise, and one hand went self- consciously to her hair. \u201cYou can read it?\u201d she said, her voice incredulous, her expression slightly horrified. \u201cMerciful Tehlu, isn\u2019t there anything you don\u2019t know?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been learning Yllish,\u201d I said. \u201cOr trying to. It\u2019s got six strands instead of four, but it\u2019s almost like a story knot, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cAlmost?\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a damn sight more than almost.\u201d Her fingers plucked at the piece of blue string at the end of her braid. \u201cEven Yllish folk barely know Yllish these days,\u201d she said under her breath, plainly irritated.\n\u201cI\u2019m not any good,\u201d I said. \u201cI just know some words.\u201d\n\u201cEven the ones that do speak it don\u2019t bother with the knots.\u201d She glared sideways at me. \u201cAnd you\u2019re supposed to read them with your fingers, not by looking at them.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve mostly had to learn by looking at pictures in books,\u201d I said.\nDenna finally untied the blue string and began to unfurl the braid, her quick fingers smoothing it back into her hair.", "\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that,\u201d I said. \u201cI liked it better before.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s rather the point, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She looked up at me, tilting her chin proudly as she shook out her hair. \u201cThere. What do you think now?\u201d\n\u201cI think I\u2019m afraid to give you any more compliments,\u201d I said, not exactly sure what I\u2019d done wrong.\nHer demeanor softened a bit, her irritation fading. \u201cIt\u2019s just embarrassing. I never expected anyone to be able to read it. How would you feel if someone saw you wearing a sign that said, \u2018I am dashing and handsome\u2019?\u201d\nThere was a pause. Before it could grow uncomfortable, I said, \u201cAm I keeping you from anything pressing?\u201d\n\u201cOnly Squire Strahota.\u201d She made a negligent gesture toward her departed escort.\n\u201cPressing, was he?\u201d I gave a half-smile, raising an eyebrow.\n\u201cAll men press, one way or another,\u201d she said with mock severity. \u201cThey\u2019re still keeping to their book then?\u201d\nDenna\u2019s expression grew rueful and she sighed. \u201cI used to hope they\u2019d\ndisregard the book with age. Instead I\u2019ve found they\u2019ve merely turned a page.\u201d She held up her hand, displaying a pair of rings. \u201cNow instead of roses they give gold, and in the giving they grow sudden bold.\u201d\n\u201cAt least you\u2019re being bored by men of means,\u201d I said consolingly.\n\u201cWho wants a mean man?\u201d she pointed out. \u201cLittle matter if his wealth is above or below the board.\u201d\nI laid a gentling hand on her arm. \u201cYou must forgive these men of mercenary thought. These poor, rich men who, seeing that you can\u2019t be caught, attempt to buy a thing they know cannot be bought.\u201d\nDenna applauded delightedly. \u201cA plea of grace for enemies!\u201d\n\u201cI merely point out that you yourself are not above the giving of gifts,\u201d I said. \u201cAs I myself well know.\u201d\nHer eyes hardened, and she shook her head. \u201cThere is a great difference between a gift given freely, and one that\u2019s meant to tie you to a man.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s truth to that,\u201d I admitted.\u201cGold can make a chain as easily as iron. Still, one can hardly blame a man who hopes to decorate you.\u201d\n\u201cHardly,\u201d she said with smile that was both wry and weary. \u201cMany of their suggestions are rather indecorous.\u201d She looked at me. \u201cWhat of you? Would you have me decorated or indecorous?\u201d\n\u201cI have given some thought to that,\u201d I said with a secret smile, knowing I had her ring tucked safely away in my room at Anker\u2019s. I made a show of", "looking her over. \u201cBoth have their merits, but gold is not for you. You are too bright for burnishing.\u201d\nDenna gripped my arm and squeezed it, giving me a fond smile. \u201cOh my Kvothe, I\u2019ve missed you. Half the reason I came back to this corner of the world was in the hope of finding you.\u201d She stood and held out her arm to me. \u201cCome, take me away from all this.\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-EIGHT": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-EIGHT\nThe Stories of Stones\nON THE LONG RIDE back to Imre, Denna and I spoke of a hundred small things. She told me about the cities she had seen: Tinu\u00eb, Vartheret, Andenivan. I told her about Ademre and showed her a few pieces of hand- language.\nShe teased me about my growing fame, and I told her the truth behind the stories. I told her how things had fallen out with the Maer, and she was properly outraged on my behalf.\nBut there was much we didn\u2019t discuss. Neither of us mentioned how we\u2019d parted ways in Severen. I didn\u2019t know if she had left in anger after our argument, or if she thought I had abandoned her. Any question seemed dangerous. Such a discussion would be uncomfortable at best. At worst it might reignite our previous argument, and that was something I was desperate to avoid.\nDenna carried her harp with her, as well as a large traveling trunk. I guessed her song was finished, and she must be performing it. It bothered me that she would play it in Imre, where countless singers and minstrels would hear and carry it out across the world.\nDespite this, I said nothing. I knew that would be a hard conversation, and I needed to pick the time for it carefully.\nNeither did I mention her patron, though what the Cthaeh had told me preyed on my mind. I thought on it endlessly. Had dreams about it.\nFelurian was another matter we didn\u2019t discuss. For all the jokes Denna made about my rescuing bandits and killing virgins, she never mentioned Felurian. She must have heard the song I\u2019d written, as it was much more popular than the other stories she seemed to know so well. But she never mentioned it, and I was not enough of a fool to bring it up myself.\nSo as we rode there were many things unspoken. The tension built in the air between us as the road jounced away beneath the cart\u2019s wheels. There were gaps and breaks in our conversation, silences that stretched too long,", "silences that were short but terrifyingly deep.\nWe were trapped in the middle of one of those silences when we finally\narrived in Imre. I dropped her off at the Boar\u2019s Head, where she planned to take rooms. I helped her carry her trunk upstairs, but the silence was even deeper there. So I skirted hastily around it, bid her a fond farewell, and fled without so much as kissing her hand.\nThat night I thought of ten thousand things I could have said to her. I lay awake, staring at the ceiling, unable to sleep until the deep, late hours of night.\nI woke early, feeling anxious and uneasy. I had breakfast with Simmon and Fela, then went to Adept Sympathy where Fenton beat me handily three duels in a row, setting him in the top rank for the first time since I\u2019d returned to the University.\nWith no other classes, I bathed and spent long minutes looking through my clothes before deciding on a simple shirt and the green vest Fela said set off my eyes. I worked my shaed into a short cape, then decided not to wear it. I didn\u2019t want Denna thinking of Felurian when I came to call.\nLastly, I slipped Denna\u2019s ring into my vest pocket and set off across the river to Imre.\nOnce at the Boar\u2019s Head I hardly had a chance to touch the door handle before Denna opened it and stepped out onto the street, handing me a basket lunch.\nI was more than slightly surprised. \u201cHow did you know. . .?\u201d\nShe wore a pale blue dress that flattered her and smiled winsomely as she linked arms with me. \u201cWoman\u2019s intuition.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d I said, trying to sound wise. The nearness of her was almost painful. The warmth of her hand on my arm, the smell of her like green leaves and the air before a summer storm. \u201cDo you know where we are bound as well?\u201d\n\u201cOnly that you will take me there.\u201d When she spoke she turned to face me, and I felt her breath against the side of my neck. \u201cI gladly leave my trust in you.\u201d\nI turned to face her, thinking to say one of the clever things I\u2019d thought of last night. But when I met her eyes all words left me. I was lost in wonder,\n \nfor how long I cannot even guess. For a long moment I was wholly hers. . . . Denna laughed, jogging me from a reverie that might have stretched a\nmoment or a minute. We made our way out of town, talking as easily as if there had never been a thing between us but sunlight and spring air.\nI led her to a place I\u2019d found earlier that spring, a small dell sheltered by the backs of trees. A stream meandered past a greystone that lay lengthwise on the ground, and the sun shone on a field of bright daisies stretching their faces to the sky.\nDenna caught her breath when we crested the ridge and saw the carpet of daisies open out in front of her. \u201cI\u2019ve waited a long time to show these flowers how pretty you are,\u201d I said.\nThat won me an enthusiastic embrace and a kiss burning on my cheek. Both were over before I knew they\u2019d begun. Bemused and grinning, I led the way through the daisies to the greystone near the stream.\nI removed my shoes and socks. Denna kicked off her shoes and tied up her skirts, then she ran to the center of the stream until the water rose past her knees.\n\u201cDo you know the secret of stones?\u201d she asked as she reached into the water. The hem of her dress dipped into the stream, but she seemed unconcerned.\n\u201cWhat secret is that?\u201d\nShe drew up a smooth, dark stone from the stream bed and held it out to me. \u201cCome see.\u201d\nI finished cuffing up my pants and made my way into the water. She held up the dripping stone. \u201cIf you hold it in your hand and listen to it . . .\u201d She did so, closing her eyes. She stood still for a long moment, her face turned upward, like a flower.\nI was drawn to kiss her, but I resisted.\nFinally she opened her dark eyes. They smiled at me. \u201cIf you listen close enough it will tell you a story.\u201d\n\u201cWhat story did it tell you?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cOnce there was a boy who came to the water,\u201d Denna said. \u201cThis is the story of a girl who came to the water with the boy. They talked and the boy threw the stones as if casting them away from himself. The girl didn\u2019t have any stones, so the boy gave her some. Then she gave herself to the boy, and he cast her away as he would a stone, unmindful of any falling she might feel.\u201d", "I was quiet for a moment, not sure if she was done. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad stone then?\u201d\nShe kissed the stone and dropped it, watching as it settled to the sand. \u201cNo, not sad. But it was thrown once. It knows the feel of motion. It has trouble staying the way most stones do. It takes the offer that the water makes and moves sometimes.\u201d She looked up at me and gave a guileless smile. \u201cWhen it moves it thinks about the boy.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t know what to make of the story, so I tried to change the subject. \u201cHow did you learn to listen to stones?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d be amazed the things you hear if only you take time to listen.\u201d She gestured to the streambed strewn with stones. \u201cTry it.You never know what you might hear.\u201d\nNot sure what game she was playing at, I looked around for a stone, then cuffed up my shirt sleeve and reached into the water.\n\u201cListen,\u201d she prompted earnestly.\nThanks to my studies with Elodin, I had a high tolerance for the ridiculous. I held the stone to my ear and closed my eyes. I wondered if I should pretend to hear a story.\nThen I was in the water, wet to the skin and spitting it. I spluttered and struggled to my feet while Denna laughed so hard she doubled over at the waist, barely able to stand.\nI moved toward her, but she skipped away with a little shriek that left her laughing even harder. So I held off chasing and made a show of wiping water from my face and arms.\n\u201cGive up so easily?\u201d she taunted. \u201cAre you so sudden doused?\u201d\nI lowered my hand into the water. \u201cI was hoping to find my stone again,\u201d I said, pretending to look around for it.\nDenna laughed, shaking her head. \u201cYou\u2019ll not lure me in that easily.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d I said. \u201cI wanted to hear the end of its story.\u201d\n\u201cWhat story was that?\u201d she asked teasingly, not coming any closer.\n\u201cIt was the story of a girl who trifled with a powerful arcanist,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\nmocked him and she scoffed at him. She laughed at him full scornfully. He caught her one day in a brook, and rhyming he did quell her fears. And then the girl forgot to look behind her, and it led to tears.\u201d\nI grinned at her and pulled my hand out of the water.\nShe turned in time for the wave to hit her. It was only as high as her waist, but it was enough to unbalance her. She went under in a swirl of dress and hair and bubbles.", "The current carried her to me and I helped her to her feet, laughing.\nShe came to the surface looking three-days drowned. \u201cNot fair!\u201d she sputtered indignantly. \u201cNot fair!\u201d\n\u201cI disagree,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re the fairest water-maid I hope to see today.\u201d\nShe splashed at me. \u201cFlatter all you like, the truth remains for God to see. You cheated. I used honest trickery.\u201d\nShe tried to dunk me then, but I was ready for it. We struggled for a while until we were pleasantly breathless. Only then did I realize how close she was. How lovely. How little our wet clothing seemed to separate us.\nDenna seemed to realize it at the same time, and we moved a little apart from each other, as if suddenly shy. The wind stirred, reminding us how wet we were. Denna skipped lightly to the shore and stripped away her dress without a moment\u2019s hesitation, tossing it over the greystone to dry. She wore a white shift underneath that clung to her as she made her way back into the water. She gave me a playful push as she passed me by, then crawled atop a smooth black boulder that lay half submerged near the center of the stream.\nIt was a perfect sunning stone, smooth basalt, dark as her eyes. The whiteness of her skin and the too-revealing shift were a sharp contrast against it, almost too bright to look on. She lay on her back and spread her hair to dry. Its wetness made a pattern against the stone that spelled the name of the wind. She closed her eyes and tipped her face toward the sun. Felurian herself could not have been more lovely, more perfectly at ease.\nI moved toward the shore as well and stripped off my sodden shirt and vest. I had to be content with my wet pants, as I had nothing else to wear. \u201cWhat does that stone tell you?\u201d I asked to fill the silence as I laid my shirt next to her dress on the greystone.\nShe ran one hand over the smooth surface of the stone and spoke without opening her eyes. \u201cThis one is telling me what it is like to live in the water, but not be a fish.\u201d She stretched like a cat. \u201cBring the basket over here, would you?\u201d\nI fetched the basket and waded out toward her, moving slowly so as not to splash. She lay perfect and still, as if asleep. But as I watched her mouth curved into a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re quiet.\u201d She said. \u201cBut I can smell you standing there.\u201d\n\u201cNothing bad I hope.\u201d\nShe shook her head gently, still not opening her eyes. \u201cYou smell like dried flowers. Like strange spice smoldering, close to catching flame.\u201d", "\u201cLike river water too, if I have any guess.\u201d\nShe stretched again and smiled an easy smile, showing the perfect whiteness of her teeth, the perfect pinkness of her lips. She shifted her position on the rock slightly. Almost as if she were making room for me. Almost. I thought of joining her. The stone was large enough for two if they were willing to lie close. . . .\n\u201cYes,\u201d Denna said.\n\u201cYes to what?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cYour question,\u201d she said, tilting her face toward me, her eyes still closed.\n\u201cYou\u2019re about to ask me a question.\u201d She adjusted her position slightly on the stone. \u201cThe answer is yes.\u201d\nHow was I to take that? What should I ask for? A kiss? More? How much was too much to ask? Was this a test? I knew asking too much would only drive her away.\n\u201cI was wondering if you would move over a little,\u201d I said gently.\n\u201cYes.\u201d She shifted again, making more space beside her. Then she opened her eyes, and they went wide at the sight of me standing shirtless above her. She glanced down and relaxed when she saw my pants.\nI laughed, but her wide-eyed look of shock pushed me back into caution. I set the basket in the place I had thought to take myself. \u201cWhat thought was that, my lady?\u201d\nShe colored a bit, embarrassed. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you were the sort to bring a girl her lunch while you were running stark.\u201d She gave a little shrug, looked at the basket, at me. \u201cBut I like you this way. My own bare-chested slave.\u201d She closed her eyes again. \u201cFeed me strawberries.\u201d\nI was happy to oblige, and so we passed the afternoon.\nLunch was long gone and the sun had dried us. For the first time since our fight in Severen, I felt things were right between us. The silences no longer lay around us like holes in the road. I knew it had just been a matter of waiting patiently until the tension passed.\nAs the afternoon slowly slid by, I knew this was the right time to bring up the subject I had been biting my tongue over for so long. I could see the dull green of old bruises on her upper arms, the remnant of a raised welt on her\n \nback. There was a scar on her leg above her knee, new enough that the red of it showed through the white of her shift.\nAll I needed to do was ask about them. If I phrased things carefully, she\u2019d admit they were from her patron. From there it would be a simple thing to draw her out. To convince her she deserved better. That whatever he was offering her was not worth this abuse.\nAnd for the first time in my life, I was in a position to offer her a way out. With Alveron\u2019s line of credit and my work in the Fishery, money would never be a problem for me. For the first time in my life, I was wealthy. I could give her a way to escape. . . .\n\u201cWhat happened to your back?\u201d Denna asked softly, interrupting my train of thought. She was still reclining on her stone, I was leaning against it, my feet in the water.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, unconsciously turning a foolish half-circle.\n\u201cYou\u2019re scarred all along your back,\u201d she said gently. I felt one of her cool hands touch my sun-warm skin, tracing a line. \u201cI could hardly tell they were scars at first. They\u2019re pretty.\u201d She traced another line down my back. \u201cIt looks like some giant-child mistook you for a piece of paper and practiced his letters on you with a silver pen.\u201d\nShe took her hand away, and I turned to face her. \u201cHow did you get them?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cI caused some trouble at the University,\u201d I said somewhat sheepishly. \u201cThey whipped you?\u201d she said, incredulous.\n\u201cTwice,\u201d I said.\n\u201cAnd you stay there?\u201d she asked as if she still couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cAfter\nthey did this to you?\u201d\nI shrugged it away. \u201cThere are worse things than whipping,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere else I can learn the things they teach here. When I want a thing it takes more than a little blood to . . .\u201d\nIt was only then I realized what I was saying. The masters whipped me. Her patron beat her. And we both stayed. How could I convince her my situation was different? How could I convince her to leave?\nDenna looked at me curiously, her head tilted to the side. \u201cWhat happens when you want a thing?\u201d\nI shrugged. \u201cI was just saying I\u2019m not easily chased away.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard that about you,\u201d Denna said, giving me a knowing look. \u201cA lot of girls in Imre say you\u2019re not easily chaste.\u201d She sat upright and began to", "slide toward the edge of the stone. Her white shift twisted and slid slowly up her legs as she moved.\nI was about to comment on her scar, hoping I might still bring the conversation around to her patron when I noticed Denna had stopped moving and was watching me as I stared at her bare legs.\n\u201cWhat do they say, exactly?\u201d I asked, more for something to say than from any curiosity.\nShe shrugged. \u201cSome think you\u2019re trying to decimate Imre\u2019s female population.\u201d She edged closer to the lip of the stone. Her shift shifted distractingly.\n\u201cDecimate would imply one in ten,\u201d I said, trying to turn it into a joke. \u201cThat\u2019s slightly ambitious even for me.\u201d\n\u201cHow reassuring,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you bring all of them h\u2014\u201d She made a little gasp as she slipped down the side of the stone. She caught herself just as I was reaching out to help her.\n\u201cBring them what?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cRoses, fool,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cOr have you turned that page already?\u201d \u201cWould you like me to carry you?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said. But before I could reach for her, she slid the rest of the\nway into the water, her shift gathering to a scandalous height before she slipped free into the stream. The water rose to her knee, just dampening the hem.\nWe made our way back to the greystone and silently worked our way into our now-dry clothes. Denna fretted at the wetness at the hem of her shift.\n\u201cYou know, I could have carried you,\u201d I said softly.\nDenna pressed the back of her hand to her forehead. \u201cAnother seven words, I swoon.\u201d She fanned herself with her other hand. \u201cWhat should a woman do?\u201d\n\u201cLove me.\u201d I had intended to say it in my best flippant tone. Teasing. Making a joke of it. But I made the mistake of looking into her eyes as I spoke. They distracted me, and when the words left my mouth, they ended up sounding nothing at all the way I had intended.\nFor a fleet second she held my eyes with intent tenderness. Then a rueful smile quirked up the corner of her mouth. \u201cOh no,\u201d she said. \u201cNot that trap for me. I\u2019ll not be one of the many.\u201d\nI clenched my teeth, stuck somewhere between confusion, embarrassment, and fear. I\u2019d been too bold and made a mess of things, just as I\u2019d always", "feared. When had the conversation managed to run away from me? \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d I said stupidly.\n\u201cYou should.\u201d Denna straightened her clothes, moving with an\nuncharacteristic stiffness, and ran her hands through her hair, twisting it into a thick plait. Her fingers knitted the strands together and for a second I could read it, clear as day: \u201cDon\u2019t speak to me.\u201d\nI might be thick, but even I can read a sign that obvious. I closed my mouth, biting off the next thing I\u2019d been about to say.\nThen Denna saw me eyeing her hair and pulled her hands away self- consciously without tying off the braid. Her hair quickly spun free to fall loose around her shoulders. She brought her hands in front of her and twisted one of her rings nervously.\n\u201cHold a moment,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019d almost forgotten.\u201d I reached into the inner pocket of my vest. \u201cI have a present for you.\u201d\nHer mouth made a thin line as she looked at my outstretched hand. \u201cYou too?\u201d she asked. \u201cI honestly thought you were different.\u201d\n\u201cI hope I am,\u201d I said, and opened my hand. I\u2019d polished it, and the sun caught the edges of the pale blue stone.\n\u201cOh!\u201d Denna\u2019s hands went to her mouth, her eyes suddenly brimming. \u201cIs it really?\u201d She reached out with both hands to take it.\n\u201cIt is,\u201d I said.\nShe turned it over in her hands, then removed one of her other rings and slid it onto her finger. \u201cIt is,\u201d she said in amazement, a few tears spilling over. \u201cHow did you ever. . .?\u201d\n\u201cI got it from Ambrose,\u201d I said.\n\u201cOh,\u201d she said. She shifted her weight from one foot to the other, and I felt the silence loom up between us again.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t much trouble,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m just sorry it took so long.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough for this.\u201d Denna reached out and took my hand between hers.\nYou would think that would have helped. That a gift and clasped hands would make things right between us. But the silence was back now, stronger than before. Thick enough that you could spread it on your bread and eat it. There are some silences that even words cannot drive away. And while Denna was touching my hand, she wasn\u2019t holding it. There is a world of difference.\nDenna looked up at the sky. \u201cThe weather\u2019s turning,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should", "probably head back before it rains.\u201d\nI nodded and we left. Clouds cast their shadows across the field behind us\nas we went.", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-NINE": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-NINE\nTangled\nANKER\u2019S WAS DESERTED EXCEPT for Sim and Fela sitting at one of the back tables. I made my way toward them and sat with my back to the wall.\n\u201cSo?\u201d Sim asked as I slumped into my seat. \u201cHow did yesterday go?\u201d I ignored the question, not really wanting to discuss it.\n\u201cWhat was yesterday?\u201d Fela asked curiously.\n\u201cHe spent the day with Denna,\u201d Sim supplied. \u201cThe whole day.\u201d\nI shrugged.\nSim lost some of his buoyant manner. \u201cNot so well?\u201d he said carefully. \u201cNot particularly,\u201d I said. I looked behind the bar, caught Laurel\u2019s eye, and\ngestured for her to bring me some of whatever was in the pot.\n\u201cCare for a lady\u2019s perspective?\u201d Fela asked gently.\n\u201cI\u2019d settle for yours.\u201d\nSimmon burst out laughing, and Fela made a face. \u201cI\u2019ll help you in spite of\nthat,\u201d she said. \u201cTell Auntie Fela all about it.\u201d\nSo I told her the bones of it. I tried my best to paint a picture of the\nsituation, but the heart of it seemed to defy explication. It sounded foolish when I tried to put it into words.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all,\u201d I said after several minutes of fumbling around the subject. \u201cOr at least that\u2019s enough of my talking about it. She confuses me like no other thing in the world.\u201d I picked at a splinter in the tabletop with my finger. \u201cI hate not understanding a thing.\u201d\nLaurel brought me warm bread and a bowl of potato soup. \u201cAnything else?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks.\u201d I smiled at her, then observed her rear aspect as she made her way back to the bar.\n\u201cAll right then,\u201d Fela said in a businesslike manner. \u201cLet\u2019s start with your good points. You\u2019re charming, handsome, and perfectly courteous to women.\u201d\nSim laughed. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see how he looked at Lauren just now? He\u2019s the", "world\u2019s first lecher. He looks at more women than I could if I had two heads with necks that spun like an owl\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d I admitted.\n\u201cThere\u2019s looking and there\u2019s looking,\u201d Fela said to Simmon. \u201cWhen some men look at you it\u2019s a greasy thing. It makes you want to have a bath. With other men it\u2019s nice. It helps you know you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d She ran a hand absently through her hair.\n\u201cYou hardly need to be reminded,\u201d Simmon said.\n\u201cEveryone needs to be reminded,\u201d she said. \u201cBut with Kvothe it\u2019s different. He\u2019s so serious about it. When he looks at you, you can tell his whole attention is focused on you.\u201d She laughed at my uncomfortable expression. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the things I liked about you when we met.\u201d\nSimmon\u2019s expression darkened, and I tried to look as nonthreatening as possible.\n\u201cBut since you came back it\u2019s almost physical,\u201d Fela said. \u201cNow when you look at me, there\u2019s something happening behind your eyes. Something all sweet fruit, shadows, and lamplight. Something wild that faerie maidens run from underneath a violet sky. It\u2019s a terrible thing, really. I like it.\u201d As she said the last, she squirmed slightly in her seat, a wicked glitter in her eye.\nIt was too much for Simmon. He pushed his chair away from the table and started to get to his feet, making inarticulate gestures. \u201cFine then . . . I\u2019ll just . . . fine.\u201d\n\u201cOh sweetling,\u201d Fela said, laying a hand on his arm. \u201cHush. It\u2019s not like that.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t hush me,\u201d he snapped, but he stayed in his chair.\nFela ran her hand through the hair on the back of Sim\u2019s neck. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing you need to worry over.\u201d She laughed as if the thought was ridiculous. \u201cYou have me tied to you more tightly than you know. But that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t enjoy a little flattery from time to time.\u201d\nSim glowered.\n\u201cShould I cloister myself then?\u201d Fela asked. Irritation crept into her voice, bringing with it the barest lilt of her Modegan accent. \u201cYou know how you feel when Mola takes the time to flirt with you?\u201d Simmon gaped and looked as if he were trying to go pale and blush at the same time. Fela laughed at his bewilderment. \u201cTiny Gods, Sim. Do you think I\u2019m blind? It\u2019s a sweet thing, and it makes you feel good. What\u2019s the harm in it?\u201d\nThere was a pause. \u201cNothing, I suppose,\u201d Sim said finally. Looking up, he", "gave me a shaky grin and brushed his hair back from his eyes. \u201cJust don\u2019t ever give me the look she mentioned, okay?\u201d His grin widened, became more genuine. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I could handle it.\u201d\nI grinned back at him without thinking of it. Sim could always make me smile.\n\u201cBesides,\u201d Fela said to him. \u201cYou\u2019re perfect just the way you are.\u201d She kissed his ear as if to put the seal on his improving mood, then turned back to me. \u201cOn the other hand, you couldn\u2019t pay me enough to get tangled up with you,\u201d she said flatly.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I demanded. \u201cWhat about my look? My dark faerie whateverness?\u201d\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re fascinating. But a girl wants more than that. She wants a man devoted to her.\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cI refuse to throw myself at her like every other man she\u2019s ever met. She hates it. I\u2019ve seen what happens.\u201d\n\u201cHave you ever thought she might feel the same way?\u201d Fela asked. \u201cYou do have something of a reputation with the ladies.\u201d\n\u201cShould I cloister myself then?\u201d I said, repeating what she\u2019d said to Sim, though it came out sharper than I\u2019d intended. \u201cBlackened body of God, I\u2019ve seen her on the arms often dozen men! Suddenly it\u2019s offensive to her if I take another woman out to see a play?\u201d\nFela gave me a frank look. \u201cYou\u2019ve been doing more than going for carriage rides. Women talk.\u201d\n\u201cWonderful. And what do they say?\u201d I asked bitterly, looking down at my soup.\n\u201cThat you\u2019re charming,\u201d she said easily. \u201cAnd polite. You don\u2019t have wandering hands, which is actually a source of frustration in some cases, apparently.\u201d She smiled a little.\nI looked up, curious. \u201cWho?\u201d\nFela hesitated. \u201cMeradin,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t hear it from me.\u201d \u201cShe didn\u2019t say twenty words to me over dinner,\u201d I said, shaking my head.\n\u201cAnd she\u2019s disappointed I didn\u2019t grope her afterward? I thought she hated me.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re a long way from Modeg,\u201d Fela said. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t sensible about sex in this part of the world. Some women don\u2019t know how to deal with a man that doesn\u2019t make bold moves.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat else do they say?\u201d", "\u201cNothing terribly surprising,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile you might not be grabby, it\u2019s certainly no challenge to trip you either. You\u2019re generous, witty, and . . .\u201d She trailed off, looking uncomfortable.\n\u201cGo ahead,\u201d I said.\nFela sighed and added, \u201cDistant.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t the crushing blow I\u2019d expected. \u201cDistant?\u201d\n\u201cSometimes all you\u2019re looking for is dinner,\u201d Fela said. \u201cOr company. Or\nconversation. Or for someone to have a friendly grope at you. But mostly you want a man to . . .\u201d She frowned and started over. \u201cWhen you\u2019re with a man . . .\u201d She trailed off again.\nI leaned forward. \u201cSay what you mean.\u201d\nFela shrugged and looked away. \u201cIf we were together, I\u2019d expect you to leave me. Not right away. Not with any malice or meanness. But I know you would. You don\u2019t seem like the sort who will settle down with a girl forever. Eventually you\u2019d move on to something more important than me.\u201d\nI prodded idly at a bit of potato in my soup, not sure of what to think.\n\u201cThere\u2019s got to be more to it than just devotion,\u201d Sim said. \u201cKvothe would turn the world upside down for this girl. You can see that, can\u2019t you?\u201d\nFela gave me a long look. \u201cI suppose I can,\u201d she said softly.\n\u201cIf you can see it, then Denna must be able to,\u201d Simmon pointed out sensibly.\nFela shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s only easy to see because I\u2019m far enough away.\u201d\n\u201cLove is blind?\u201d Sim laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s the advice you have to offer?\u201d He rolled his eyes. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\u201cI never said I was in love,\u201d I interjected. \u201cI never said that. She confuses me, and I\u2019m fond of her. But it doesn\u2019t go further than that. How could it? I don\u2019t know her well enough to make any earnest claim of love. How can I love something I don\u2019t understand?\u201d\nThey looked at me in silence for a moment. Then Sim burst out in his boyish laugh as if I\u2019d just said the most ridiculous thing he\u2019d ever heard. He took hold of Fela\u2019s hand and kissed it squarely on her multifaceted ring of stone. \u201cYou win,\u201d he said to her. \u201cLove is blind, and a deaf-mute too. I\u2019ll never doubt your wisdom again.\u201d\n \nStill feeling out of sorts, I went looking for Master Elodin, eventually finding him sitting under a tree in a small garden next to the Mews.\n\u201cKvothe!\u201d He waved lazily. \u201cCome. Sit.\u201d He nudged a bowl toward me with his foot. \u201cHave some grapes.\u201d\nI took a few. Fresh fruit wasn\u2019t a rarity for me these days, but the grapes were lovely nonetheless, just on the verge of being overripe. I chewed pensively, my mind still tangled with thoughts of Denna.\n\u201cMaster Elodin,\u201d I asked slowly. \u201cWhat would you think of someone who kept changing their own name?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d He sat up suddenly, his eyes wild and panicked. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d\nHis reaction startled me, and I held up my hands defensively. \u201cNothing!\u201d I insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s not me. It\u2019s a girl I know.\u201d\nElodin\u2019s face grew ashen. \u201cFela?\u201d he said. \u201cOh no. No. She wouldn\u2019t do something like that. She\u2019s too smart for that.\u201d It sounded as if he were desperately trying to convince himself.\n\u201cI\u2019m not talking about Fela,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m talking about a young girl I know. Every time I turn around she\u2019s picked another name for herself.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Elodin said, relaxing. He leaned back against the tree, laughing softly. \u201cCalling names,\u201d he said with tangible relief. \u201cGod\u2019s bones, boy, I thought . . .\u201d He broke off, shaking his head.\n\u201cYou thought what?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d he said dismissively. \u201cNow. What\u2019s this about a girl?\u201d\nI shrugged, beginning to regret bringing it up in the first place. \u201cI was just\nwondering what you\u2019d say about a girl who keeps changing her name. Every time I turn around she\u2019s picked a different one. Dianah. Donna. Dyane.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m assuming she\u2019s not some fugitive?\u201d Elodin asked, smiling. \u201cHunted. Doing her best to evade the iron law of Atur. That sort of thing?\u201d\n\u201cNot to the best of my knowledge,\u201d I said with a faint smile of my own.\n\u201cIt could indicate she doesn\u2019t know who she is,\u201d he said. \u201cOr that she does know, and doesn\u2019t like it.\u201d He looked up and rubbed his nose thoughtfully. \u201cIt could indicate restlessness and dissatisfaction. It could mean her nature is changeable and she shifts her name to fit it. Or it could mean she changes her name with the hope it might help her be a different person.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of nothing,\u201d I said testily. \u201cIt\u2019s like saying you know your soup is either hot or cold. That an apple is either sweet or sour.\u201d I gave him a frown. \u201cIt\u2019s just a complicated way of saying you don\u2019t know anything.\u201d", "\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask me what I knew of such a girl,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cYou asked me what I would say of such a girl.\u201d\nI shrugged, tiring of the subject. We ate grapes in silence as we watched the students come and go.\n\u201cI called the wind again,\u201d I said, realizing I hadn\u2019t told him yet. \u201cDown in Tarbean.\u201d\nHe perked up at that. \u201cDid you now?\u201d he said, turning to look at me expectantly. \u201cLet\u2019s hear it then. All the details. \u201d\nElodin was everything you could want in an audience, attentive and enthusiastic. I related the entire story, not sparing a few dramatic flourishes. By the end of it, I found my mood much improved.\n\u201cThat\u2019s three times this term,\u201d Elodin said approvingly. \u201cSought and found when you had need of it. And not just a breeze but a breath. That\u2019s subtle stuff.\u201d He looked at me from the corner of his eye, giving me a sly smile. \u201cHow long do you think it will be before you can make yourself a ring of air?\u201d\nI lifted up my naked left hand, fingers spread. \u201cWho\u2019s to say I\u2019m not already wearing it?\u201d\nElodin rocked with laughter, then stopped when my expression didn\u2019t change. His brow furrowed a bit as he gave me a speculative look, eyes flickering first to my hand, then back to my face. \u201cAre you joking?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d I said, looking him calmly in the eye. \u201cAm I?\u201d", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY\nFolly\nSPRING TERM ROLLED ON. Contrary to what I\u2019d expected, Denna didn\u2019t make any public performances in Imre. Instead, she headed north to Anilin after a handful of days.\nBut this time she made a special trip to Anker\u2019s to tell me she was leaving. I found myself strangely flattered by this and couldn\u2019t help but feel it was a sign that things were not entirely sour between us.\nThe Chancellor fell ill just as the term was coming to a close. Though I didn\u2019t know him very well, I liked Herma. Not only did I find him to be a surprisingly easygoing teacher when he had been teaching me Yllish, but he had been kind to me when I was new to the University. Nevertheless, I wasn\u2019t particularly worried. Arwyl and the staff of the Medica could do everything just short of bringing people back from the dead.\nBut days passed and no news came from the Medica. Rumor said he was too weak to leave his bed, plagued with spikes of fever that threatened to burn away his powerful arcanist\u2019s mind.\nWhen it became apparent he wouldn\u2019t be able to resume his duties as Chancellor anytime soon, the masters gathered to decide who would fill his place. Perhaps permanently, should his condition worsen.\nAnd, to make a painful story short, Hemme was appointed Chancellor. After the shock wore off, it was easy to see why. Kilvin, Arwyl, and Lorren were too busy to take up the extra duties. The same could be said for Mandrag and Dal to a lesser extent. That left Elodin, Brandeur, and Hemme.\nElodin didn\u2019t want it, and was generally regarded as too erratic to serve. And Brandeur always faced whatever direction Hemme\u2019s own wind was blowing.\nSo Hemme gained the Chancellor\u2019s chair. While I found it irritating, it had little impact on my day-to-day life. The only precaution I took was to step with extra care around even the least of the University\u2019s laws, knowing if I were put on the horns now, Hemme\u2019s vote would count doubly against me.", " As admissions approached, Master Herma remained weak and fevered. So it was with a knot of sour dread in my stomach that I prepared for my first admissions interview with Hemme as Chancellor.\nI went through the questioning with the same careful artifice I\u2019d maintained for the last two terms. I hesitated and made a few mistakes, earning a tuition of twenty talents or so. Enough to earn some money, but not enough to embarrass myself too badly.\nHemme, as always, asked double-sided or misleading questions designed to trip me, but that was nothing new. The only real difference seemed to be that Hemme smiled a great deal. It wasn\u2019t a pleasant smile either.\nThe masters had their usual muted conference. Then Hemme read my tuition: fifty talents. Apparently the Chancellor had greater control over these things than I had ever known.\nI forced myself to bite my lip to keep from laughing, and arranged my face in a dejected expression as I made my way to the basement of Hollows where the bursar kept his counting room. Riem\u2019s eyes brightened at the sight of my tuition slip. He disappeared into his back room and returned in a moment with an envelope of thick paper.\nI thanked him and returned to my room at Anker\u2019s, maintaining my morose expression all the way. Once I had the door closed, I tore open the heavy envelope and poured its contents into my hand: two gleaming gold marks worth ten talents each.\nI laughed then. Laughed until my eyes watered and my sides ached. Then I drew on my best suit of clothes and gathered my friends: Wilem and Simmon, Fela and Mola. I sent a runner boy to Imre with an invitation to Devi and Threpe. Then I hired a four-horse carriage and had the lot of us driven across the river to Imre.\nWe stopped by the Eolian. Denna wasn\u2019t there, but I collected Deoch instead and we made our way to the King\u2019s Arms, an establishment of the sort no self-respecting student could ever afford. The doorman looked the motley lot of us over scornfully, as if he would object, but Threpe frowned his best gentleman\u2019s frown and ushered all of us safely inside.\nThen commenced a night of pleasant decadence the likes of which I have hardly seen equaled since. We ate and drank, and I paid for everything happily. The only water on the table was in the hand bowls. In our cups there", "was only old Vintish wines, dark scutten, cool metheglin, sweet brand, and every toast we drank was to Hemme\u2019s folly.", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-ONE": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-ONE\nLocks\nKVOTHE DREW A DEEP breath and nodded to himself. \u201cLet\u2019s stop there,\u201d he said. \u201cMoney in my pocket for the first time in my life. Surrounded by friends. That\u2019s a good place to end for the night.\u201d He idly rubbed his hands together, right hand massaging the left absentmindedly. \u201cIf we go much farther, things get dark again.\u201d\nChronicler picked up the short stack of finished pages and tapped them on the table, squaring their corners before resting the half-finished page on top. He opened his leather satchel, removed the bright green crown of holly, and slid the pages inside.Then he screwed shut his inkwell and began to dismantle and clean all the pieces of his pen.\nKvothe stood and stretched. Then he gathered up the empty plates and cups, carrying them into the kitchen.\nBast merely sat, his expression blank. He didn\u2019t move. He hardly seemed to be breathing. After several minutes Chronicler began to dart glances in his direction.\nKvothe came back into the room and frowned. \u201cBast,\u201d he said.\nBast slowly turned his eyes to look at the man behind the bar.\n\u201cShep\u2019s wake is still going on,\u201d Kvothe said. \u201cThere\u2019s not much cleaning\nup to do tonight. Why don\u2019t you head over for the end of it? They\u2019ll be glad to have you. . . .\u201d\nBast considered for a moment, then shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Reshi,\u201d he said, his voice flat. \u201cI\u2019m not really in the mood.\u201d He pushed himself out of his chair and made his way across the room toward the stairs without looking either of them in the eye. \u201cI\u2019ll just turn in.\u201d\nThe hard sounds of his footsteps retreated slowly into the distance, followed by the sound of a closing door.\nChronicler watched him go, then turned to look at the red-haired man behind the bar.\nKvothe was looking at the stairway too, his eyes concerned. \u201cHe\u2019s just had", "a rough day,\u201d he said, sounding as if he were speaking to himself as much as his guest. \u201cHe\u2019ll be fine tomorrow.\u201d\nWiping off his hands, Kvothe walked around the bar and headed to the front door. \u201cDo you need anything before you turn in?\u201d he asked.\nChronicler shook his head and began fitting his pen back together.\nKvothe locked the front door with a large brass key, then turned to Chronicler. \u201cI\u2019ll leave this in the lock for you,\u201d he said. \u201cIn case you wake up early and feel like having a walk or somesuch. I don\u2019t tend to sleep very much these days.\u201d He touched the side of his face where a bruise was beginning to mottle his jaw. \u201cBut tonight I might make an exception.\u201d\nChronicler nodded and shouldered his satchel. Then he delicately picked up his holly crown and headed up the stairs.\nAlone in the common room, Kvothe swept the floor methodically, catching all the corners. He finished the dishes, washed the tables and the bar, and rolled down all the lamps but one, leaving the room dimly lit and full of flickering shadow.\nFor a moment he looked at the bottles behind the bar, then turned and made his own slow climb upstairs.\nBast stepped slowly into his room, closing the door behind himself.\nHe moved quietly through the dark to stand before the hearth. Nothing but\nash and cinder remained from the morning\u2019s fire. Bast opened the woodbin, but there was nothing inside except a thick layer of chaff and chips at the bottom.\nThe dim light from the window glinted in his dark eyes and showed the outline of his face as he stood motionless, as if trying to decide what to do. After a moment he let the lid of the bin fall closed, wrapped himself in a blanket, and folded himself onto a small couch in front of the empty fireplace.\nHe sat there for a long while, eyes open in the dark.\nThere was a faint scuffle outside his window. Then nothing. Then a faint scraping. Bast turned and saw a dark shape outside, moving in the night.\nBast went motionless, then slid smoothly from the couch to stand in front of the fireplace. Eyes still on the window, his hands hunted carefully across\n \nthe top of the mantel.\nThere was another scrape at the window, louder this time. Bast\u2019s eyes\ndarted away from the window to the mantel, and he caught up something with both hands. Metal gleamed faintly in the dim moonlight as he crouched, his body tense as a coiled spring.\nFor a long moment there was nothing. No sound. No movement outside the window or in the darkened room.\nTap-tap-tap-tap-tap. It was a faint noise, but perfectly clear in the stillness of the room. There was a pause, then the noise came again, sharp and insistent against the window glass: tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap.\nBast sighed. Relaxing out of his tense crouch, he walked over to the window, threw the drop bar, and opened it.\n\u201cMy window doesn\u2019t have a lock,\u201d Chronicler said petulantly. \u201cWhy does yours?\u201d\n\u201cObvious reasons,\u201d Bast said.\n\u201cCan I come in?\u201d\nBast shrugged and moved back toward the fireplace while Chronicler\nclimbed awkwardly through the window. Bast struck a match and lit a lamp on a nearby table, then carefully set a pair of long knives on the mantel. One was slender and sharp as a blade of grass, the other keen and graceful as a thorn.\nChronicler looked around as light swelled to fill the room. It was large, with rich wood paneling and thick carpets. Two lounging couches faced each other in front of the fireplace, and one corner of the room was dominated by a huge canopy bed with deep green curtains.\nThere were shelves filled with pictures, trinkets, and oddments. Locks of hair wrapped in ribbon. Whistles carved from wood. Dried flowers. Rings of horn and leather and woven grass. A hand-dipped candle with leaves pressed into the wax.\nAnd, in what was obviously a recent addition, holly boughs decorated parts of the room. One long garland ran along the headboard of the bed, and another was strung along the mantle, weaving in and out through the handles of a pair of bright, leaf-bladed hatchets hanging there.\nBast sat back in front of the cold fireplace and wrapped a rag blanket around his shoulders like a shawl. It was a chaos of ill-matching fabric and faded color except for a bright red heart sewn squarely in the center.\n\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d Chronicler said softly.", "Bast shrugged, his eyes fixed dully on the fireplace.\nChronicler took a step closer. \u201cI need to ask you ...\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to whisper,\u201d Bast said without looking up. \u201cWe\u2019re on the\nother side of the inn. Sometimes I have guests. It used to keep him awake, so I moved to this side of the building. There are six solid walls between my room and his.\u201d\nChronicler sat on the edge of the other couch, facing Bast. \u201cI need to ask about some of the things you said tonight. About the Cthaeh.\u201d\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t talk about the Cthaeh.\u201d Bast\u2019s voice was flat and leaden. \u201cIt\u2019s not healthy.\u201d\n\u201cThe Sithe then,\u201d Chronicler said. \u201cYou said if they knew about this story, they\u2019d kill everyone involved. Is that true?\u201d\nBast nodded, eyes still on the fireplace. \u201cThey\u2019d burn this place and salt the earth behind them.\u201d\nChronicler looked down, shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t understand this fear you have of the Cthaeh,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Bast said, \u201cevidence seems to indicate that you\u2019re not terribly smart.\u201d\nChronicler frowned and waited patiently.\nBast sighed, finally pulling his eyes away from the fireplace. \u201cThink. The Cthaeh knows everything you\u2019re ever going to do. Everything you\u2019re going to say . . .\n\u201cThat makes it an irritating conversationalist,\u201d Chronicler said. \u201cBut not \u2014\u201d\nBast\u2019s expression went suddenly furious. \u201cDyen vehat. Enfeun vehat tyloren tes!\u201d he spat almost incoherently. He was trembling, clenching and unclenching his hands.\nChronicler went pale at the venom in Bast\u2019s voice, but he didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cYou\u2019re not angry at me,\u201d he said calmly, looking Bast in the eye. \u201cYou\u2019re just angry, and I happen to be nearby.\u201d\nBast glared at him, but said nothing.\nChronicler leaned forward. \u201cI\u2019m trying to help, you know that, right?\u201d Bast nodded sullenly.\n\u201cThat means I need to understand what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nBast shrugged, his sudden flare of temper had burned itself out, leaving\nhim listless again.\n\u201cKvothe seems to believe you about the Cthaeh,\u201d Chronicler said.", "\u201cHe knows the hidden turnings of the world,\u201d Bast said. \u201cAnd what he doesn\u2019t understand he\u2019s quick to grasp.\u201d Bast\u2019s fingers flicked idly at the edges of the blanket. \u201cAnd he trusts me.\u201d\n\u201cBut doesn\u2019t it seem contrived? The Cthaeh gives a boy a flower, one thing leads to another, and suddenly there\u2019s a war.\u201d Chronicler made a dismissive motion. \u201cThings don\u2019t work that way. It\u2019s too much coincidence.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not coincidence.\u201d Bast gave a short sigh. \u201cA blind man has to stumble through a cluttered room. You don\u2019t. You use your eyes and pick the easy way. It\u2019s clear to you as anything. The Cthaeh can see the future. All futures. We have to fumble through. It doesn\u2019t. It merely looks and picks the most disastrous path. It is the stone that stirs the avalanche. It is the cough that starts the plague.\u201d\n\u201cBut if you know the Cthaeh is trying to steer you,\u201d Chronicler said. \u201cYou would just do something else. He gives you the flower, and you just sell it.\u201d\nBast shook his head. \u201cThe Cthaeh would know. You can\u2019t second-guess a thing that knows your future. Say you sell the flower to the prince. He uses the flower to heal his betrothed. A year later she catches him diddling the chambermaid, hangs herself in disgrace, and her father launches an attack to avenge her honor.\u201d Bast spread his hands helplessly. \u201cYou still get civil war.\u201d\n\u201cBut the young man who sold the flower stays safe.\u201d\n\u201cProbably not,\u201d Bast said grimly. \u201cMore likely he gets drunk as a lord, catches the pox, then knocks over a lamp and sets half the city on fire.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re just making things up to prove your point,\u201d Chronicler said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not actually proving anything.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do I need to prove anything to you?\u201d Bast asked. \u201cWhy would I care\nwhat you think? Be happy in your silly little ignorance. I\u2019m doing you a favor by not telling you the truth.\u201d\n\u201cWhat truth is that?\u201d Chronicler said, plainly irritated.\nBast gave a weary sigh, and looked up at Chronicler, his expression utterly empty of all hope. \u201cI would rather fight Haliax himself,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d rather face all the Chandrian together than have ten words of conversation with the Cthaeh.\u201d\nThis gave Chronicler a bit of a pause. \u201cThey\u2019d kill you,\u201d he said. Something in his voice made it a question.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Bast said. \u201cEven so.\u201d\nChronicler stared at the dark-haired man sitting across from him, wrapped in a rag blanket. \u201cStories taught you to fear the Cthaeh,\u201d he said, disgust plain", "in his voice. \u201cAnd that fear is making you stupid.\u201d\nBast shrugged, his empty eyes drifting back to the nonexistent fire. \u201cYou\nbore me, manling.\u201d\nChronicler stood up, stepped forward, and slapped Bast hard across the\nface.\nBast\u2019s head rocked to the side, and for a moment he seemed too shocked to\nmove. Then he came to his feet in a blur of motion, blanket flying from his shoulders. He grabbed Chronicler roughly by the throat, teeth bared, his eyes a deep, unbroken blue.\nChronicler looked him squarely in the eye. \u201cThe Cthaeh set all of this in motion,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cIt knew you would attack me, and terrible things will come of it.\u201d\nBast\u2019s furious expression went stiff, his eyes widening. The tension left his shoulders as he let go of Chronicler\u2019s throat. He started to sink back down onto the cushions of the couch.\nChronicler drew back his arm and slapped him again. If anything, the sound was even louder than before.\nBast bared his teeth again, then stopped. His eyes darted to Chronicler, then away.\n\u201cThe Cthaeh knows you fear it,\u201d Chronicler said. \u201cIt knows I would use that knowledge against you. It\u2019s still manipulating you. If you don\u2019t attack me, terrible things will come of it.\u201d\nBast froze as if paralyzed, trapped halfway between standing and sitting. \u201cAre you listening to me?\u201d Chronicler said. \u201cAre you finally awake?\u201d Bast looked up at the scribe with an expression of confused amazement. A\nbright red mark was blossoming on his cheek. He nodded, sinking slowly back onto the couch.\nChronicler drew back his arm. \u201cWhat will you do if I hit you again?\u201d \u201cBeat ten colors of guts out of you,\u201d Bast said earnestly.\nChronicler nodded and sat back down on his couch. \u201cI will, for the sake of\nargument, accept that the Cthaeh knows the future. That means it can control many things.\u201d He raised a finger. \u201cBut not everything. The fruit you ate today was still sweet in your mouth, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\nBast nodded slowly.\n\u201cIf the Cthaeh is as malicious as you say, it would harm you in every way possible. But it cannot. It could not keep you from making your Reshi laugh this morning. It could not keep you from enjoying the sun on your face or", "kissing the rosy cheeks of farmers\u2019 daughters, could it?\u201d\nA flicker of a grin found Bast\u2019s face. \u201cI kissed more than that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat,\u201d Chronicler said firmly, \u201cis my point. It cannot poison every thing\nwe do.\u201d\nBast looked thoughtful, then sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re right in a way,\u201d he said. \u201cBut\nonly an idiot sits in a burning house and thinks everything is fine because fruit is still sweet.\u201d\nChronicler made a point of looking around the room. \u201cThe inn doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s on fire to me.\u201d\nBast looked at him incredulously. \u201cThe whole world is burning down,\u201d he said. \u201cOpen your eyes.\u201d\nChronicler frowned. \u201cEven ignoring everything else,\u201d he said, bulling ahead. \u201cFelurian let him go. She knew he\u2019d spoken with the Cthaeh, surely she wouldn\u2019t have loosed him on the world unless she had some way to guard against its influence.\u201d\nBast\u2019s eyes brightened at the thought, then dimmed almost immediately. He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for depth in a shallow stream,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t follow you,\u201d Chronicler demanded. \u201cWhat possible reason could\nshe have for letting him go if he was truly dangerous?\u201d\n\u201cReason?\u201d Bast asked, dark amusement coloring his voice. \u201cNo reason.\nShe\u2019s got nothing to do with reason. She let him go because it pleased her pride. She wanted him to go out into the mortal world and sing her praises. Tell stories about her. Pine for her. That\u2019s why she let him leave.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve already told you. My folk are not famous for our good decisions.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Chronicler said. \u201cOr perhaps she simply recognized the futility of trying to second-guess the Cthaeh.\u201d He made a nonchalant gesture. \u201cIf whatever you\u2019re going to do is wrong, you might as well do whatever you want.\u201d\nBast sat quietly for a long moment. Then he nodded, faintly at first, then more firmly. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said. \u201cIf everything is going to end in tears anyway, I should do what I want.\u201d\nBast looked around the room, then came suddenly to his feet. After a moment\u2019s searching, he found a thick cloak crumpled on the floor. He gave it a vigorous shake and wrapped it around his shoulders before heading to the window. Then he stopped, came back to the couch, and rummaged in the cushions until he found a bottle of wine.\nChronicler looked puzzled. \u201cWhat are you doing? Are you going back to", "Shep\u2019s wake?\u201d\nBast paused on his way back to the window, seeming almost surprised to\nsee Chronicler still standing there. \u201cI am going about my business,\u201d he said tucking the bottle of wine under his arm. He opened the window and swung one foot outside. \u201cDon\u2019t wait up.\u201d\nKvothe stepped briskly into his room, closing the door behind himself.\nHe moved about busily. He cleared the cold ashes from the fireplace and\nset new wood in its place, sparking the fire to life with a fat red sulfur match. He fetched a second blanket and spread it over his narrow bed. Frowning slightly, he picked up the crumpled piece of paper from where it had fallen to the floor and returned it to the top of his desk where it sat next to the two other crumpled sheets.\nThen, moving almost reluctantly, he made his way to the foot of his bed. Taking a deep breath, he wiped his hands on his pants and knelt in front of the dark chest that sat there. He rested both hands on the curved lid and closed his eyes, as if listening for something. His shoulders shifted as he tugged against the lid.\nNothing happened. Kvothe opened his eyes. His mouth made a grim line. His hands moved again, pulling harder, straining for a long moment before giving up.\nExpressionless, Kvothe stood and walked to the window that overlooked the woods behind the inn. He slid it open and leaned out, reaching down with both hands. Then he drew himself back inside, clutching a slender wooden box.\nBrushing away a coating of dust and spiderwebs, he opened the box. Inside lay a key of dark iron and a key of bright copper. Kvothe knelt in front of the chest again and fit the copper key into the iron lock. With slow precision he turned it: left, then right, then left again, listening carefully to the faint clicks of some mechanism inside.\nThen he lifted the iron key and fit it into the copper plate. This key he did not turn. He slid it deep into the lock, brought it halfway out, then pushed it back before drawing it free in a smooth, quick motion.\nAfter replacing the keys in their box, he put his hands back on the sides of\n \nthe lid in the same position as before. \u201cOpen,\u201d he said under his breath. \u201cOpen, damn you. Edro.\u201d\nHe lifted, his back and shoulders tensing with the effort of it.\nThe lid of the chest didn\u2019t budge. Kvothe gave a long sigh and leaned forward until his forehead pressed against the cool dark wood. As the air rushed out of him, his shoulders sagged, leaving him looking small and wounded, terribly tired and older than his years.\nHis expression, however, showed no surprise, no grief. It was merely resigned. It was the expression of a man who has finally received bad news he\u2019d already known was on the way.", ""], "CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-TWO": ["CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-TWO\nElderberry\nIT WAS A BAD night to be caught in the open.\nThe clouds had rolled in late, like a grey sheet pulled across the sky. The\nwind was chill and gusty, with fits and starts of rain that spattered down heavily before fading into drizzle.\nFor all this, the two soldiers camped in a thicket near the road seemed to be enjoying themselves. They\u2019d found a woodcutter\u2019s stash and built their fire so high and hot that the occasional gust of rain did little more than make it spit and hiss.\nThe two men were talking loudly, laughing the wild, braying laughter of men too drunk to care about the weather.\nEventually a third man emerged from the dark trees, stepping delicately over the trunk of a nearby fallen tree. He was wet, if not soaked, and his dark hair was plastered flat to his head. When the soldiers saw him, they lifted their bottles and called out an enthusiastic greeting.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t know if you\u2019d make it,\u201d the blonde soldier said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shit night. But it\u2019s only fair you get your third.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re wet through,\u201d said the bearded one, lifting up a narrow yellow bottle. \u201cSuck on this. It\u2019s some fruit thing, but it kicks like a pony.\u201d\n\u201cYours is girly piss,\u201d the blonde soldier said, holding up his own. \u201cHere. Now this here is a man\u2019s drink.\u201d\nThe third man looked back and forth as if unable to decide. Finally he lifted a finger, pointing at one bottle then the other as he began to chant.\nMaple. Maypole. Catch and carry. Ash and Ember. Elderberry.\nHe ended pointing at the yellow bottle, then gripped it by the neck and", "lifted to his lips. He took a long, slow drink, his throat working silently. \u201cHey there,\u201d said the bearded soldier. \u201cSave a bit!\u201d\nBast lowered the bottle and licked his lips. He gave a dry, humorless\nchuckle. \u201cYou got the right bottle,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s elderberry.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re nowhere near as chatty as you were this morning,\u201d the blonde\nsoldier said, cocking his head to one side. \u201cYou look like your dog died. Is everything alright?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bast said. \u201cNothing\u2019s alright.\u201d\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t our fault if he figured it out,\u201d the blonde one said quickly. \u201cWe waited a bit after you left, just like you said. But we\u2019d been sitting for hours already. Thought you were never going to leave.\u201d\n\u201cHell,\u201d the bearded man said, irritated. \u201cDoes he know? He throw you out?\u201d\nBast shook his head and tipped the bottle back again.\n\u201cThen you ain\u2019t got nothing to complain of.\u201d The blonde soldier rubbed the side of his head, scowling. \u201cSilly bastard gave me a lump or two.\u201d\n\u201cHe got it back with some to spare.\u201d The bearded soldier grinned, rubbing his thumb across his knuckles. \u201cHe\u2019ll be pissing blood tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cSo it\u2019s all good at the end,\u201d the blonde soldier said philosophically, lurching unsteadily as he waved his bottle a little too dramatically. \u201cYou got to skin your knuckles. I got a drink of something lovely. And we all made a heavy penny. Everyone\u2019s happy. Everyone gets what they wanted most.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get what I wanted,\u201d Bast said flatly.\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d the bearded soldier said, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a purse that made a weighty chink as he bounced it in his palm. \u201cGrab a piece of fire and we\u2019ll divvy this up.\u201d\nBast looked around the circle of firelight, making no move to take a seat. Then he began to chant again as he pointed at things randomly: a nearby stone, a log, a hatchet . . .\nFallow farrow. Ash and oak. Bide and borrow. Chimney smoke.\nHe ended pointing at the fire. He stepped close, stooped low, and pulled out a branch longer than his arm. The far end was a solid knot of glowing", "coal.\n\u201cHell, you\u2019re drunker than I am,\u201d the bearded soldier guffawed. \u201cThat\u2019s\nnot what I meant when I said grab a piece of fire.\u201d\nThe blonde soldier rolled with laughter.\nBast looked down at the two men. After a moment he began to laugh too. It\nwas a terrible sound, jagged and joyless. It was no human laugh. \u201cHoy,\u201d the bearded man interrupted sharply, his expression no longer\namused. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d\nIt began to rain again, a gust of wind spattering heavy drops against Bast\u2019s\nface. His eyes were dark and intent. There was another gust of wind that made the end of the branch flare a brilliant orange.\nThe hot coal traced a glowing arc through the air as Bast began to point it back and forth between the two men, chanting:\nBarrel. Barley. Stone and stave. Wind and water. Misbehave.\nBast finished with the burning branch pointing at the bearded man. His teeth were red in the firelight. His expression was nothing like a smile.", ""], "EPILOGUE": ["EPILOGUE\nA Silence of Three Parts\nIT WAS NIGHT AGAIN. The Waystone Inn lay in silence, and it was a silence of three parts.\nThe most obvious part was a hollow, echoing quiet, made by things that were lacking. If there had been a steady rain it would have drummed against the roof, sluiced the eaves, and washed the silence slowly out to sea. If there had been lovers in the beds of the inn, they would have sighed and moaned and shamed the silence into being on its way. If there had been music ... but no, of course there was no music. In fact there were none of these things, and so the silence remained.\nOutside the Waystone, the noise of distant revelry blew faintly through the trees. A strain of fiddle. Voices. Stomping boots and clapping hands. But the sound was slender as a thread, and a shift in the wind broke it, leaving only rustling leaves and something almost like the far-off shrieking of an owl. That faded too, leaving nothing but the second silence, waiting like an endless indrawn breath.\nThe third silence was not an easy thing to notice. If you listened for an hour, you might begin to feel it in the chill metal of a dozen locks turned tight to keep the night away. It lay in rough clay jugs of cider and the hollow taproom gaps where chairs and tables ought to be. It was in the mottling ache of bruises that bloomed across a body, and it was in the hands of the man who wore the bruises as he rose stiffly from his bed, teeth clenched against the pain.\nThe man had true-red hair, red as flame. His eyes were dark and distant, and he moved with the subtle certainty of a thief in the night. He made his way downstairs. There, behind the tightly shuttered windows, he lifted his hands like a dancer, shifted his weight, and slowly took one single perfect step.\nThe Waystone was his, just as the third silence was his. This was appropriate, as it was the greatest silence of the three, wrapping the others inside itself. It was deep and wide as autumn\u2019s ending. It was heavy as a great", "river-smooth stone. It was the patient, cut-flower sound of a man who is waiting to die.\n"]}
